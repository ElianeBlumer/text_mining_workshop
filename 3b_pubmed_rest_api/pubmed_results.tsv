26174762	Combining intracellular antibodies to restore function of mutated p53 in cancer.	Chan G, Jordaan G, Nishimura RN, Weisbart RH.	TP53 is a tumor suppressor gene that is mutated in 50% of cancers, and its function is tightly regulated by the E3 ligase, Mdm2. Both p53 and Mdm2 are localized in the cell nucleus, a site that is impervious to therapeutic regulation by most antibodies. We identified a cell-penetrating lupus monoclonal anti-DNA antibody, mAb 3E10, that targets the nucleus, and we engineered mAb 3E10 to function as an intranuclear transport system to deliver therapeutic antibodies into the nucleus as bispecific single chain Fv (scFv) fragments. Bispecific scFvs composed of 3E10 include PAb421 (3E10-PAb421) that binds p53 and restores the function of mutated p53, and 3G5 (3E10-3G5) that binds Mdm2 and prevents destruction of p53 by Mdm2. We documented the therapeutic efficacy of these bispecific scFvs separately in previous studies. In this study, we show that combination therapy with 3E10-PAb421 and 3E10-3G5 augments growth inhibition of cells with p53 mutations compared to the effect of either antibody alone. By contrast, no enhanced response was observed in cells with wild-type p53 or in cells homozygous null for p53.
26577528	PDL1 Regulation by p53 via miR-34.	Cortez MA, Ivan C, Valdecanas D, Wang X, Peltier HJ, Ye Y, Araujo L, Carbone DP, Shilo K, Giri DK, Kelnar K, Martin D, Komaki R, Gomez DR, Krishnan S, Calin GA, Bader AG, Welsh JW.	Although clinical studies have shown promise for targeting PD1/PDL1 signaling in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the regulation of PDL1 expression is poorly understood. Here, we show that PDL1 is regulated by p53 via miR-34.p53 wild-type and p53-deficient cell lines (p53(-/-) and p53(+/+) HCT116, p53-inducible H1299, and p53-knockdown H460) were used to determine if p53 regulates PDL1 via miR-34. PDL1 and miR-34a expression were analyzed in samples from patients with NSCLC and mutated p53 vs wild-type p53 tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas for Lung Adenocarcinoma (TCGA LUAD). We confirmed that PDL1 is a direct target of miR-34 with western blotting and luciferase assays and used a p53(R172HΔ)g/+K-ras(LA1/+) syngeneic mouse model (n = 12) to deliver miR-34a-loaded liposomes (MRX34) plus radiotherapy (XRT) and assessed PDL1 expression and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). A two-sided t test was applied to compare the mean between different treatments.We found that p53 regulates PDL1 via miR-34, which directly binds to the PDL1 3' untranslated region in models of NSCLC (fold-change luciferase activity to control group, mean for miR-34a = 0.50, SD = 0.2, P < .001; mean for miR-34b = 0.52, SD = 0.2, P = .006; and mean for miR-34c = 0.59, SD = 0.14, and P = .006). Therapeutic delivery of MRX34, currently the subject of a phase I clinical trial, promoted TILs (mean of CD8 expression percentage of control group = 22.5%, SD = 1.9%; mean of CD8 expression percentage of MRX34 = 30.1%, SD = 3.7%, P = .016, n = 4) and reduced CD8(+)PD1(+) cells in vivo (mean of CD8/PD1 expression percentage of control group = 40.2%, SD = 6.2%; mean of CD8/PD1 expression percentage of MRX34 = 20.3%, SD = 5.1%, P = .001, n = 4). Further, MRX34 plus XRT increased CD8(+) cell numbers more than either therapy alone (mean of CD8 expression percentage of MRX34 plus XRT to control group = 44.2%, SD = 8.7%, P = .004, n = 4). Finally, miR-34a delivery reduced the numbers of radiation-induced macrophages (mean of F4-80 expression percentage of control group = 52.4%, SD = 1.7%; mean of F4-80 expression percentage of MRX34 = 40.1%, SD = 3.5%, P = .008, n = 4) and T-regulatory cells.We identified a novel mechanism by which tumor immune evasion is regulated by p53/miR-34/PDL1 axis. Our results suggest that delivery of miRNAs with standard therapies, such as XRT, may represent a novel therapeutic approach for lung cancer.
25752701	p14(ARF) Prevents Proliferation of Aneuploid Cells by Inducing p53-Dependent Apoptosis.	Veneziano L, Barra V, Lentini L, Spatafora S, Di Leonardo A.	Weakening the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint by reduced expression of its components induces chromosome instability and aneuploidy that are hallmarks of cancer cells. The tumor suppressor p14(ARF) is overexpressed in response to oncogenic stimuli to stabilize p53 halting cell progression. Previously, we found that lack or reduced expression of p14(ARF) is involved in the maintenance of aneuploid cells in primary human cells, suggesting that it could be part of a pathway controlling their proliferation. To investigate this aspect further, p14(ARF) was ectopically expressed in HCT116 cells after depletion of the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint MAD2 protein that was used as a trigger for aneuploidy. p14(ARF) Re-expression reduced the number of aneuploid cells in MAD2 post-transcriptionally silenced cells. Also aberrant mitoses, frequently displayed in MAD2-depleted cells, were decreased when p14(ARF) was expressed at the same time. In addition, p14(ARF) ectopic expression in MAD2-depleted cells induced apoptosis associated with increased p53 protein levels. Conversely, p14(ARF) ectopic expression did not induce apoptosis in HCT116 p53KO cells. Collectively, our results suggest that the tumor suppressor p14(ARF) may have an important role in counteracting proliferation of aneuploid cells by activating p53-dependent apoptosis. J. Cell.

26291961	Intelligent DNA machine for the ultrasensitive colorimetric detection of nucleic acids.	Xu J, Qian J, Li H, Wu ZS, Shen W, Jia L.	As DNA is employed to serve as a smart building block, an increasing interest has been devoted to the development of different DNA-based machines for the specific purpose, for example, the exploration of inter- or intramolecular interaction. In the current contribution, we developed an intelligent DNA machine and its operation can be designed to execute the ultrasensitive colorimetric detection of target nucleic acids. The DNA machine consists of a hairpin probe (HP) and an assistant template (AT). Using p53 gene as the target model to trigger the molecular machine operation, cyclic nucleic acid strand displacement polymerization (CNDP) was specifically induced, leading to the DNAzyme mediated catalytic reaction for signal readout. Specifically, with the help of polymerase and nickase, one target molecule was able to drive DNA nano-mechanical devices one-by-one through the hybridization/polymerization displacement cycles, and every initiated machine continued to operate, causing the dramatic accumulation of G-quadruplex-contained products. The G-quadruplex structure after binding to hemin could act as a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-mimicking DNAzyme and catalyzed the oxidation of 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) by H2O2. As a result, an enhanced color change could be detected because of the generation of oxidation product ABTS•(+). In this way, the DNA machine has no any signal loss and enables the quantitative measurement of p53 DNA with a detection limit of 10fM, indicating great promise for unique application in biomedical research and early clinical diagnosis.
26464464	Reactivation of p53 by a Cytoskeletal Sensor to Control the Balance Between DNA Damage and Tumor Dissemination.	Herraiz C, Calvo F, Pandya P, Cantelli G, Rodriguez-Hernandez I, Orgaz JL, Kang N, Chu T, Sahai E, Sanz-Moreno V.	BACKGROUND: Abnormal cell migration and invasion underlie metastasis, and actomyosin contractility is a key regulator of tumor invasion. The links between cancer migratory behavior and DNA damage are poorly understood. METHODS: Using 3D collagen systems to recapitulate melanoma extracellular matrix, we analyzed the relationship between the actomyosin cytoskeleton of migrating cells and DNA damage. We used multiple melanoma cell lines and microarray analysis to study changes in gene expression and in vivo intravital imaging (n = 7 mice per condition) to understand how DNA damage impacts invasive behavior. We used Protein Tissue Microarrays (n = 164 melanomas) and patient databases (n = 354 melanoma samples) to investigate the associations between markers of DNA damage and actomyosin cytoskeletal features. Data were analyzed with Student's and multiple t tests, Mann-Whitney's test, one-way analysis of variance, and Pearson correlation. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Melanoma cells with low levels of Rho-ROCK-driven actomyosin are subjected to oxidative stress-dependent DNA damage and ATM-mediated p53 protein stabilization. This results in a specific transcriptional signature enriched in DNA damage/oxidative stress responsive genes, including Tumor Protein p53 Inducible Protein 3 (TP53I3 or PIG3). PIG3, which functions in DNA damage repair, uses an unexpected catalytic mechanism to suppress Rho-ROCK activity and impair tumor invasion in vivo. This regulation was suppressed by antioxidants. Furthermore, PIG3 levels decreased while ROCK1/2 levels increased in human metastatic melanomas (ROCK1 vs PIG3; r = -0.2261, P < .0001; ROCK2 vs PIG3: r = -0.1381, P = .0093). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest using Rho-kinase inhibitors to reactivate the p53-PIG3 axis as a novel therapeutic strategy; we suggest that the use of antioxidants in melanoma should be very carefully evaluated.
26430901	Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide Improves Hypoxia-Induced Inflammation and Apoptosis via Nitric Oxide in H9c2 Cardiomyoblast Cells.	Duan L, Lei H, Zhang Y, Wan B, Chang J, Feng Q, Huang W.	The aim of this work was to investigate whether calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) plays a protective role in cardiomyocytes against hypoxia-induced inflammation and apoptosis via an NO-mediated pathway.H9c2 cardiac cells were exposed to hypoxia for 2 h to establish a model of myocardial hypoxic-ischemic injury. The cells were pretreated with either CGRP or nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor (L-NAME) before being exposed to hypoxia for 30 min. Cell viability was analyzed using a cell counter kit 8 (CCK-8). The levels of IL-6 and TNF-α were determined by the corresponding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression levels of several apoptosis proteins (p53, caspase-3, cytochrome C) and NOS were detected by Western blot assays. An NO kit was used to evaluate the production of NO.Pretreatment of H9c2 cardiac cells with CGRP for 30 min prior to exposure to hypoxia markedly improved cell viability (83.57 ± 3.21 vs. 62.83 ± 8.30%, p < 0.001); the same effect was observed following pretreatment with the NOS inhibitor L-NAME (89.34 ± 5.95 vs. 75.01 ± 5.61%, p < 0.01). Pretreatment with CGRP also significantly attenuated the inflammatory responses induced by hypoxia, as evidenced by decreases of the levels of both IL-6 (193.21 ± 13.54 vs. 293.38 ± 56.49%, p < 0.001) and TNF-α (207.71 ± 44.27 vs. 281.46 ± 64.88%, p < 0.001). Additionally, CGRP significantly decreased the hypoxia-induced overexpression of the apoptotic proteins (p53: 0.27 ± 0.10 vs. 0.87 ± 0.30, p < 0.001; caspase-3: 0.65 ± 0.15 vs. 0.98 ± 0.26, p < 0.001; cytochrome C: 1.51 ± 0.39 vs. 2.80 ± 0.69, p < 0.001) and enhanced the expression of both endothelial NOS (eNOS; 0.59 ± 0.24 vs. 0.37 ± 0.14, p < 0.05) and phosphorylated eNOS (0.60 ± 0.13 vs. 0.40 ± 0.07, p < 0.05). Furthermore, the application of both L-NAME and CGRP attenuated the hypoxia-induced expression of inducible NOS (iNOS; p < 0.05) and enhanced a hypoxia-mediated decrease in NO (p < 0.01). Interestingly, the expression levels of cell apoptosis (p < 0.05), iNOS and eNOS (p < 0.05) were decreased with L-NAME and CGRP cotreatment following 2 h of acute hypoxia, but the apoptotic factors (p < 0.05) were increased compared with only CGRP pretreatment.CGRP protects cardiomyocytes from hypoxia-induced inflammation and apoptosis by modulating NO production.
26463923	Sevoflurane Preconditioning Confers Neuroprotection via Anti-apoptosis Effects.	Wang H, Shi H, Yu Q, Chen J, Zhang F, Gao Y.	Neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia afforded by volatile anesthetic preconditioning (APC) has been demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro, yet the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. We previously reported that repeated sevoflurane APC reduced infarct size in rats after focal ischemia. In this study, we investigated whether inhibition of apoptotic signaling cascades contributes to sevoflurane APC-induced neuroprotection. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to ambient air or 2.4 % sevoflurane for 30 min per day for 4 consecutive days and then subjected to occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) for 60 min at 24 h after the last sevoflurane intervention. APC with sevoflurane markedly decreased apoptotic cell death in rat brains, which was accompanied by decreased caspase-3 cleavage and cytochrome c release. The apoptotic suppression was associated with increased ratios of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins over pro-apoptotic proteins and with decreased activation of JNK and p53 pathways. Thus, our data suggest that suppression of apoptotic cell death contributes to the neuroprotection against ischemic brain injury conferred by sevoflurane preconditioning.
26059022	Gallic acid induces apoptosis in human cervical epithelial cells containing human papillomavirus type 16 episomes.	Shi L, Lei Y, Srivastava R, Qin W, Chen JJ.	The high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) that infect the anogenital tract are strongly associated with the development of cervical carcinoma, which is the second most common cancer in women worldwide. Therapeutic drugs specifically targeting HPV are not available. Polyphenolic compounds have gained considerable attention because of their cytotoxic effects against a variety of cancers and certain viruses. In this study, we examined the effects of several polyphenols on cellular proliferation and death of the human cervical cancer cells and human cervical epithelial cells containing stable HPV type 16 episomes (HPVep). Our results show that three polyphenols inhibited proliferation of HeLa cells dose-dependently. Furthermore, one of the examined polyphenols, gallic acid (GA), also inhibited the proliferation of HPVep cells and exhibited significant specificity towards HPV-positive cells. The anti-proliferative effect of GA on HPVep and HeLa cells was associated with apoptosis and upregulation of p53. These results suggest that GA can be a potential candidate for the development of anti-HPV agents. J. Med. Virol. 88:127-134, 2016. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
26174106	S-Adenosylmethionine Affects ERK1/2 and Stat3 Pathways and Induces Apotosis in Osteosarcoma Cells.	Ilisso CP, Sapio L, Delle Cave D, Illiano M, Spina A, Cacciapuoti G, Naviglio S, Porcelli M.	Osteosarcoma is a very aggressive bone tumor. Its clinical outcome remains discouraging despite intensive surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Thus, novel therapeutic approaches are demanded. S-Adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) is a naturally occurring molecule that is synthesized in our body by methionine adenosyltransferase isoenzymes and is also available as a nutritional supplement. AdoMet is the principal methyl donor in numerous methylation reactions and is involved in many biological functions. Interestingly, AdoMet has been shown to exert antiproliferative action in various cancer cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are just starting to be studied. Here, we investigated the effects of AdoMet on the proliferation of osteosarcoma U2OS cells and the underlying mechanisms. We carried out direct cell number counting, MTT and flow cytometry-based assays, and immunoblotting experiments in response to AdoMet treatment. We found that AdoMet strongly inhibits proliferation of U2OS cells by slowing-down cell cycle progression and by inducing apoptosis. We also report that AdoMet consistently causes an increase of p53 and p21 cell-cycle inhibitor, a decrease of cyclin A and cyclin E protein levels, and a marked increase of pro-apoptotic Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, with caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage. Moreover, the AdoMet-induced antiproliferative effects were dynamically accompanied by profound changes in ERK1/2 and STAT3 protein and phosphorylation levels. Altogether, our data enforce the evidence of AdoMet acting as a biomolecule with antiproliferative action in osteosarcoma cells, capable of down-regulating ERK1/2 and STAT3 pathways leading to cell cycle inhibition and apoptosis, and provide a rationale for the possible use of AdoMet in osteosarcoma therapy.

26497429	Synergistic therapeutic effects of Schiff's base cross-linked injectable hydrogels for local co-delivery of metformin and 5-fluorouracil in a mouse colon carcinoma model.	Wu X, He C, Wu Y, Chen X.	In situ formed hydrogels based on Schiff base reaction were formulated for the co-delivery of metformin (ME) and 5-fluorouracil (5FU). The reactive aldehyde-functionalized four-arm polyethylene glycol (PFA) was synthesized by end-capping of 4-arm PEG with 4-formylbenzoic acid (FA) and used as a cross-linking agent. The injectable hydrogels are designed through the quick gelation induced by the formation of covalent bonds via Schiff-base reaction of PFA with 4-arm poly (ethylene glycol)-b-poly (L-lysine) (PPLL). This formulation eliminated the need for metal catalysts and complicated processes in the preparation of in situ-forming hydrogels. In vitro degradation and drug release studies demonstrated that both ME and 5FU were released through PFA/PPLL hydrogels in a controlled and pH-dependent manner. When incubated with mouse colon adenocarcinoma cells (C26), the ME/5FU-incorporated PFA/PPLL hydrogels had synergistic inhibitory effects on the cell cycle progression and cell proliferation in colon cancer cells. After a single subcutaneous injection of the hydrogel containing ME/5FU beside the tumors of BALB/c mice inoculated with C26 cells, the dual-drug-loaded hydrogels displayed superior therapeutic activity resulted from a combination of p53-mediated G1 arrest and apoptosis in C26 cells. Hence, the Schiff's base cross-linked hydrogels containing ME and 5FU may have potential therapeutic applications in the treatments of colon cancer.
26583177	Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of Secondary Neuronal Injury following Traumatic Brain Injury	Krishnamurthy K, Laskowitz DT.	Excitotoxicity—the cascade of intracellular events initiated by excessive stimulation by neurotransmitters leading to intracellular calcium overload—is hypothesized to play an important role in mediating secondary neuronal injury after traumatic brain injury (TBI). While a variety of neurotransmitters could potentially trigger excitotoxic cell injury, glutamate is thought to be the primary contributor because of its potent effect on increasing intracellular calcium through ionotropic receptors (primarily NMDAR, but also kainate and calcium-permeable AMPAR). Microdialysis studies in rodents after both fluid percussion injury and controlled cortical impact have demonstrated a substantial increase in extracellular glutamate proportional to the severity of injury.1,2 A number of clinical observations also support the hypothesis that TBI increases extracellular glutamate. Multiple reports analyzing glutamate levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with the elevation often persisting beyond 1 week after injury.3,4 A prospective microdialysis study in patients suffering severe TBI showed an increase in extracellular glutamate in over 75% of patients; interestingly, values normalized over the course of 120 hours in 60% of these patients, but persistent elevations of extracellular glutamate were associated with increased mortality.5
26583176	Genetic Influences in Traumatic Brain Injury	Bennett ER, Reuter-Rice K, Laskowitz DT.	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, affecting all ages and demographics. In the United States alone, approximately 1.7 million new cases are reported yearly,1–3 resulting in death in roughly 5% of individuals, long-term disability in greater than 40%, and 25% of affected adults unable to return to work 1 year following the injury.4 Symptoms associated with TBI can appear immediately following injury or days to weeks later, and result in wide-ranging physical and psychological deficits including motor impairment, epilepsy, personality change, and memory impairment. TBI is classified into three categories designated mild, moderate, and severe, based on the severity of injury using the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) and other clinical measures.5,6 These tools assess whether the individual was unconscious and duration, length of amnesia, resulting cognitive, behavioral or physical disability, and subsequent recovery. Mild TBI (mTBI) is the most common subtype of TBI, with estimates ranging from 1.6 million to 3.8 million annually among U.S. athletes alone. Despite its designation, a mild TBI should not be viewed as an inconsequential injury, as some mTBIs can result in prolonged cognitive, emotional, and functional disabilities, significantly impacting quality of life. Predicting outcome following TBI is challenging, and cannot be made based solely on clinical presentation and radiological findings since patients with comparable injuries may have variable outcomes. The injury itself can be viewed as occurring in two distinct phases, a primary phase and secondary phase. The primary phase occurs at impact from the mechanical forces of the injury which can disrupt the brain parenchyma and integrity of the blood–brain barrier (BBB). This is followed by a systemic and neuroinflammatory response or secondary phase, mediated by peripheral immune cells and activation of resident neural cells, triggering the release of molecular mediators such as cytokines, growth factors, and adhesion molecules, and activation of a complex network of pathways. Secondary injury can develop over a period of hours to days and months following the primary injury. Some of these pathways are involved in reparative processes,7,8 whereas others contribute to metabolic dysregulation that may result in secondary brain injury. Apoptosis of neurons and glia contribute to the overall pathology of TBI, and neurons undergoing apoptosis have been identified within contusions in the acute post-traumatic phase, as well as in regions remote from the site of injury in the days and weeks following trauma.9 The genes involved in TBI can be roughly categorized into those that influence the extent of the injury (e.g., pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines) and those that effect repair and plasticity (e.g., neurotrophic genes). An additional category of genes that should be considered are those that effect pre-and postinjury cognitive and neurobehavioral capacity (e.g., catecholamine genes).10 A growing body of literature has attributed a role for genetic factors in the interindividual variability observed in TBI, and in predicting functional and cognitive outcome following brain injury.10–14 These variations are a result of alterations in the DNA sequence within a given gene and are referred to as genetic polymorphisms. Polymorphisms can arise from insertions or deletions of short lengths of DNA within a particular gene, interfering with the normal function of the gene, or at a single nucleotide (G, A, T, or C). When a single nucleotide is responsible for the modification in the DNA, it is referred to as a single nucleotide polymorphism or SNP. SNPs are the most common type of genetic variation, occurring once every 100–300 nucleotides, amounting to approximately 10 million in the human genome. A SNP can reside within the coding sequence of a gene where it may alter the amino acid composition of a protein, or within a noncoding region of a gene, such as a promoter or intron, where it may influence expression of the gene and protein production. The nomenclature for SNPs can be confusing since an individual SNP may be represented in several different ways in the literature. A common depiction can be illustrated with the SNP –174 G/C in the interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene; here, the “174” denotes the nucleotide number at which the variation occurs, the “–” designates that it occurs upstream of the transcription start site (designated +1) in the noncoding region of the gene, and the G/C refers to the nucleotide change at that position, in this case within the promoter region. For the SNP +3953 C/T in the interleukin-1 beta (IL1B) gene, the “+” denotes that the variation occurs downstream from the transcription start site at nucleotide position 3953. The most prevalent variation is commonly referred to as “allele 1” or “major allele”. When a SNP is officially registered in a public database maintained by the U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information, it is assigned a unique identifier referred to as an rs number (e.g., rs1800795 identifies IL6 SNP –174 G/C). To date, numerous genes have been implicated in the pathophysiology and outcome following moderate to severe TBI. More recently, considerable attention has focused on genes associated with mild and repetitive mTBIs, notably among combat veterans and professional athletes.15–17 Although inheriting a single “good” or “bad” allele of a specific gene may predispose an individual to better or worse outcome following injury, it is becoming increasingly apparent that recovery from TBI is polygenic in nature, involving the interaction of numerous genes from multiple pathways. Moreover, one must also consider the role of epigenetic mechanisms in disease and injury,18–20 processes that can effect gene expression without altering the DNA sequence (e.g., DNA methylation, chromatin modifications). The purpose of this chapter is to provide a current overview of genetic polymorphisms associated with recovery and outcome following acute TBI in an adult population. It is not intended to serve as an in-depth study of the individual genes and possible mechanisms of action; several reviews exist in the literature that address this in greater detail.
25263447	p53 protein aggregation promotes platinum resistance in ovarian cancer.	Yang-Hartwich Y, Soteras MG, Lin ZP, Holmberg J, Sumi N, Craveiro V, Liang M, Romanoff E, Bingham J, Garofalo F, Alvero A, Mor G.	High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), the most lethal gynecological cancer, often leads to chemoresistant diseases. The p53 protein is a key transcriptional factor regulating cellular homeostasis. A majority of HGSOCs have inactive p53 because of genetic mutations. However, genetic mutation is not the only cause of p53 inactivation. The aggregation of p53 protein has been discovered in different types of cancers and may be responsible for impairing the normal transcriptional activation and pro-apoptotic functions of p53. We demonstrated that in a unique population of HGSOC cancer cells with cancer stem cell properties, p53 protein aggregation is associated with p53 inactivation and platinum resistance. When these cancer stem cells differentiated into their chemosensitive progeny, they lost tumor-initiating capacity and p53 aggregates. In addition to the association of p53 aggregation and chemoresistance in HGSOC cells, we further demonstrated that the overexpression of a p53-positive regulator, p14ARF, inhibited MDM2-mediated p53 degradation and led to the imbalance of p53 turnover that promoted the formation of p53 aggregates. With in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrated that the inhibition of p14ARF could suppress p53 aggregation and sensitize cancer cells to platinum treatment. Moreover, by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry we discovered that the aggregated p53 may function uniquely by interacting with proteins that are critical for cancer cell survival and tumor progression. Our findings help us understand the poor chemoresponse of a subset of HGSOC patients and suggest p53 aggregation as a new marker for chemoresistance. Our findings also suggest that inhibiting p53 aggregation can reactivate p53 pro-apoptotic function. Therefore, p53 aggregation is a potential therapeutic target for reversing chemoresistance. This is paramount for improving ovarian cancer patients' responses to chemotherapy, and thus increasing their survival rate.
26343523	Reactivating p53 functions by suppressing its novel inhibitor iASPP: a potential therapeutic opportunity in p53 wild-type tumors.	Dong P, Ihira K, Hamada J, Watari H, Yamada T, Hosaka M, Hanley SJ, Kudo M, Sakuragi N.	Although mutational inactivation of p53 is found in 50% of all human tumors, a subset of tumors display defective p53 function, but retain wild-type (WT) p53. Here, direct and indirect mechanisms leading to the loss of WT p53 activities are discussed. We summarize the oncogenic roles of iASPP, an inhibitor of WT p53, in promoting proliferation, invasion, drug or radiation-resistance and metastasis. From the therapeutic view, we highlight promising perspectives of microRNA-124, peptide and small molecules that reduce or block iASPP for the treatment of cancer. High iASPP expression enhances proliferation, aggressive behavior, the resistance to radiation/chemotherapy and correlates with poor prognosis in a range of human tumors. Overexpression of iASPP accelerates tumorigenesis and invasion through p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms. MicroRNA-124 directly targets iASPP and represses the growth and invasiveness of cancer cells. The disruption of iASPP-p53 interaction by a p53-derived peptide A34 restores p53 function in cancer cells. The inhibition of iASPP phosphorylation with small molecules induces p53-dependent apoptosis and growth suppression. The mechanisms underlying aberrant expression of iASPP in human tumors should be further investigated. Reactivating WT p53 functions by targeting its novel inhibitor iASPP holds promise for potential therapeutic interventions in the treatment of WT p53-containing tumors.
26408402	Inactivation of the p53-KLF4-CEBPA axis in acute myeloid leukemia.	Seipel K, Teixera Marques M, Bozzini MA, Meinken C, Mueller BU, Pabst T.	PURPOSE: In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the transcription factors CEBPA and KLF4 as well as the universal tumor suppressor p53 are frequently deregulated. Here, we investigated the extent of dysregulation, the molecular interactions and the mechanisms involved. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: 110 AML patient samples were analyzed for protein levels of CEBPA, KLF4, p53 and p53 modulators. Regulation of CEBPA gene expression by KLF4 and p53 or by chemical p53 activators was characterized in AML cell lines. RESULTS: We found that CEBPA gene transcription can be directly activated by p53 and KLF4 suggesting a p53-KLF4-CEBPA axis. In AML patient cells, we observed a prominent loss of p53 function and concomitant reduction of KLF4 and CEBPA protein levels. Assessment of cellular p53 modulator proteins indicated that p53 inactivation in leukemic cells correlated with elevated levels of the nuclear export protein XPO1/CRM1 and increase of the p53 inhibitors MDM2 and CUL9/PARC in the cytoplasm. Finally, restoring p53 function following treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy compounds and p53 restoring non-genotoxic agents induced CEBPA gene expression, myeloid differentiation and cell cycle arrest in AML cells. CONCLUSIONS: The p53-KLF4-CEBPA axis is deregulated in AML, but can be functionally restored by conventional chemotherapy and novel p53 activating treatments.
25172038	Mechanisms of p53 degradation.	Chao CC.	The tumor suppressor p53 plays various functional roles in the cell by regulating multiple regulatory signals that ensure adequate temporal and spatial responses to cellular stress. p53 is usually kept inactive due to ubiquitination by a number of E3 ubiquitin ligases that target p53 for proteasomal degradation. The ubiquitously expressed proto-oncogene Mdm2 is the major E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in this process and is critical for regulating p53 homeostasis. Ubiquitination by E3 ligases may induce cellular relocation of p53 and determine the outcome of p53-mediated stress response, including cell proliferation, apoptosis and efficacy of cancer therapy. In addition to marking p53 for proteasomal degradation, ubiquitination acts as a signal for the degradation-independent functions of p53, such as nuclear export and transcriptional activation. Importantly, the reversible nature of the ubiquitination process and the identification of de-ubiquitination enzymes acting on p53 have added yet another layer of regulatory mechanism controlling p53 activity. This review highlights our current understanding of the mechanisms underlying p53 degradation as well as the significance of the p53 pathway in response to genotoxic stress.
25728675	TRIM25 has a dual function in the p53/Mdm2 circuit.	Zhang P, Elabd S, Hammer S, Solozobova V, Yan H, Bartel F, Inoue S, Henrich T, Wittbrodt J, Loosli F, Davidson G, Blattner C.	P53 is an important tumor suppressor that, upon activation, induces growth arrest and cell death. Control of p53 is thus of prime importance for proliferating cells, but also for cancer therapy, where p53 activity contributes to the eradication of tumors. Mdm2 functionally inhibits p53 and targets the tumor suppressor protein for degradation. In a genetic screen, we identified TRIM25 as a novel regulator of p53 and Mdm2. TRIM25 increased p53 and Mdm2 abundance by inhibiting their ubiquitination and degradation in 26 S proteasomes. TRIM25 co-precipitated with p53 and Mdm2 and interfered with the association of p300 and Mdm2, a critical step for p53 polyubiquitination. Despite the increase in p53 levels, p53 activity was inhibited in the presence of TRIM25. Downregulation of TRIM25 resulted in an increased acetylation of p53 and p53-dependent cell death in HCT116 cells. Upon genotoxic insults, TRIM25 dampened the p53-dependent DNA damage response. The downregulation of TRIM25 furthermore resulted in massive apoptosis during early embryogenesis of medaka, which was rescued by the concomitant downregulation of p53, demonstrating the functional relevance of the regulation of p53 by TRIM25 in an organismal context.
25444901	A small peptide derived from p53 linker region can resume the apoptotic activity of p53 by sequestering iASPP with p53.	Qiu S, Cai Y, Gao X, Gu SZ, Liu ZJ.	One of the most important tumor suppression functions of p53 is its ability to induce apoptosis. iASPP is an inhibitory member of the ASPP protein family. It can specifically inhibit the normal function of p53 as a suppressor. The mechanism of iASPP suppressing the cell apoptotosis is through inhibiting the transactivation function of p53 on the promoters of proapoptotic genes by binding with p53. Therefore, relieving the combination of iASPP with p53 and leaving p53 free may be a useful strategy to activate p53 function. We therefore use A34, a small peptide derived from p53 linker region, to investigate the possibility of resuming the apoptosis activity of p53 by sequestering iASPP with p53 and derepressing p53. The results show that A34 can competitively combine with iASPP and therefore release p53 from iASPP; A34 can enhance the transcriptional activity of p53 on the promoters of Bax and PUMA; A34 can increase cell apoptosis and slow tumor growth in vitro and vivo. This study will open the way for using small molecule peptides that directly disturb the interaction of p53 with iASPP, thereby resume function of p53 as a suppressor.
25788166	Significance of p53 expression in background endometrium in endometrial carcinoma.	Nguyen TT, Hachisuga T, Urabe R, Kurita T, Kagami S, Kawagoe T, Shimajiri S, Nabeshima K.	The p53 signature (p53S) has been proposed to be a marker of the earliest phase of development of endometrial serous carcinoma. We examined the presence of p53S in the background endometrium in cases of endometrial carcinoma. From a series of 351 endometrial carcinomas, 225 (64.1 %) lesions, for which slides of the adjacent noncancerous endometrium were available for review, were included. Expression of estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha, Ki-67, and p53 in the adjacent endometrium was studied by immunohistochemistry. The p53S was defined as the presence of morphologically benign endometrial epithelial cells with moderate to strong intensity of p53 immunostaining. Of the 225 noncancerous endometrium samples, 34 consisted of hyperplastic and 191 of non-hyperplastic endometrium. A p53S was found in 22 cases (mean age 64.2 years), 2 in hyperplastic, and 20 in non-hyperplastic background endometrium. All p53S-positive cases also expressed ER-alpha; their median Ki-67 labeling index (LI) was 4.0 % (range 0.0 to 21.0 %). The two cases with hyperplastic p53S-positive background endometrium were in association with a grade 1 endometrioid tumor in a premenopausal woman with Lynch syndrome. Of the 152 cases of endometrioid adenocarcinomas with non-hyperplastic endometrium, 12 (8 %) were p53S positive, none of which associated with EIC. Of the 21 cases of serous carcinoma, five (24 %) were p53S positive, 4 of which (19 %) associated with EIC while in 5 others (24 %) EIC was found without p53S. Of three clear cell adenocarcinomas, none were p53S positive while two contained EIC without p53S. Of 15 carcinosarcomas, 3 (20 %) were p53S positive, all of which with EIC while 6 others (40 %) were associated with EIC but without p53S. Of the 8 non-endometrioid tumors with p53S, 7 (88 %) were associated with EIC. p53S is thought to be associated with precancerous lesions of non-endometrioid tumors, including carcinosarcomas.
25168242	L-GILZ binds p53 and MDM2 and suppresses tumor growth through p53 activation in human cancer cells.	Ayroldi E, Petrillo MG, Bastianelli A, Marchetti MC, Ronchetti S, Nocentini G, Ricciotti L, Cannarile L, Riccardi C.	The transcription factor p53 regulates the expression of genes crucial for biological processes such as cell proliferation, metabolism, cell repair, senescence and apoptosis. Activation of p53 also suppresses neoplastic transformations, thereby inhibiting the growth of mutated and/or damaged cells. p53-binding proteins, such as mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), inhibit p53 activation and thus regulate p53-mediated stress responses. Here, we found that long glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (L-GILZ), a recently identified isoform of GILZ, activates p53 and that the overexpression of L-GILZ in p53(+/+) HCT116 human colorectal carcinoma cells suppresses the growth of xenografts in mice. In the presence of both p53 and MDM2, L-GILZ binds preferentially to MDM2 and interferes with p53/MDM2 complex formation, making p53 available for downstream gene activation. Consistent with this finding, L-GILZ induced p21 and p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) expression only in p53(+/+) cells, while L-GILZ silencing reversed the anti-proliferative activity of dexamethasone as well as expression of p53, p21 and PUMA. Furthermore, L-GILZ stabilizes p53 proteins by decreasing p53 ubiquitination and increasing MDM2 ubiquitination. These findings reveal L-GILZ as a regulator of p53 and a candidate for new therapeutic anti-cancer strategies for tumors associated with p53 deregulation.
26250460	CP-31398 inhibits the growth of p53-mutated liver cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.	He XX, Zhang YN, Yan JW, Yan JJ, Wu Q, Song YH.	The tumor suppressor p53 is one of the most frequently mutated genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Previous studies demonstrated that CP-31398 restored the native conformation of mutant p53 and trans-activated p53 downstream genes in tumor cells. However, the research on the application of CP-31398 to liver cancer has not been reported. Here, we investigated the effects of CP-31398 on the phenotype of HCC cells carrying p53 mutation. The effects of CP-31398 on the characteristic of p53-mutated HCC cells were evaluated through analyzing cell cycle, cell apoptosis, cell proliferation, and the expression of p53 downstream genes. In tumor xenografts developed by PLC/PRF/5 cells, the inhibition of tumor growth by CP-31398 was analyzed through gross morphology, growth curve, and the expression of p53-related genes. Firstly, we demonstrated that CP-31398 inhibited the growth of p53-mutated liver cancer cells in a dose-dependent and p53-dependent manner. Then, further study showed that CP-31398 re-activated wild-type p53 function in p53-mutated HCC cells, which resulted in inhibitive response of cell proliferation and an induction of cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Finally, in vivo data confirmed that CP-31398 blocked the growth of xenografts tumors through transactivation of p53-responsive downstream molecules. Our results demonstrated that CP-31398 induced desired phenotypic change of p53-mutated HCC cells in vitro and in vivo, which revealed that CP-31398 would be developed as a therapeutic candidate for HCC carrying p53 mutation.
26372730	Genome-wide analysis of p53 transcriptional programs in B cells upon exposure to genotoxic stress in vivo.	Tonelli C, Morelli MJ, Bianchi S, Rotta L, Capra T, Sabò A, Campaner S, Amati B.	The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription factor that coordinates the cellular response to DNA damage. Here we provide an integrated analysis of p53 genomic occupancy and p53-dependent gene regulation in the splenic B and non-B cell compartments of mice exposed to whole-body ionizing radiation, providing insight into general principles of p53 activity in vivo. In unstressed conditions, p53 bound few genomic targets; induction of p53 by ionizing radiation increased the number of p53 bound sites, leading to highly overlapping profiles in the different cell types. Comparison of these profiles with chromatin features in unstressed B cells revealed that, upon activation, p53 localized at active promoters, distal enhancers, and a smaller set of unmarked distal regions. At promoters, recognition of the canonical p53 motif as well as binding strength were associated with p53-dependent transcriptional activation, but not repression, indicating that the latter was most likely indirect. p53-activated targets constituted the core of a cell type-independent response, superimposed onto a cell type-specific program. Core response genes included most of the known p53-regulated genes, as well as many new ones. Our data represent a unique characterization of the p53-regulated response to ionizing radiation in vivo.
26598601	P53 restoration in induction and maintenance of senescence - differential effects in premalignant and malignant tumor cells.	Harajly M, Zalzali H, Nawaz Z, Ghayad SE, Ghamloush F, Basma H, Zainedin S, Rabeh W, Jabbour M, Tawil A, Badro D, Evan GI, Saab R.	Restoration of p53 has been suggested as a therapeutic approach in tumors. However, the timing of p53 restoration in relation to its efficacy during tumor progression is still unclear. We now show that restoration of p53 in murine pre-malignant proliferating pineal lesions resulted in cellular senescence, while p53 restoration in invasive pineal tumors did not. The effectiveness of p53 restoration was not dependent on p19(Arf) expression, but showed inverse correlation with Mdm2 expression. In tumor cells, p53 restoration became effective when paired with either DNA damaging therapy or with Nutlin, an inhibitor of p53-Mdm2 interaction. Interestingly, inactivation of p53 after senescence resulted in re-entry into the cell cycle and rapid tumor progression. Evaluation of a panel of human supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors (sPNET) showed low activity of the p53 pathway. Together, this data suggests that restoration of the p53 pathway has different effects in premalignant versus invasive pineal tumors, and that p53 activation needs to be continually sustained, as reversion from senescence occurs rapidly with aggressive tumor growth when p53 is lost again. Finally, p53 restoration approaches may be worth exploring in sPNET, where the p53 gene is intact but the pathway inactive in the majority of examined tumors.
25961449	Tumor suppressor p53 stole the AKT in hypoxia.	Yun Z, Glazer PM.	The presence of hypoxia within a tumor is associated with poor clinical outcome, which is often exacerbated by loss of the tumor suppressor p53. In the presence of functional p53, hypoxic conditions promote apoptosis; however, the p53-dependent genes that mediate this process are not well understood. In this issue of the JCI, Leszczynska and colleagues identify a p53-dependent six-gene signature that is specifically induced in hypoxia and mediates apoptosis. In patients with a variety of cancers, downregulation of this gene signature was associated with poor clinical outcome. Induction of p53-dependent apoptosis under hypoxia was mediated by AKT inhibition, and treatment with the combination of an AKT inhibitor and ionizing radiation decreased tumor size in a p53-deficient xenograft model more substantially than either single-agent treatment. The results of this study provide important insight into p53-mediated apoptosis under hypoxia and suggest that AKT inhibition has therapeutic potential for inducing apoptosis in hypoxic, p53-deficient cancers.
25573363	Mdm2-dependent regulation of p53 expression during long-term potentiation.	Lisachev PD, Pustylnyak VO, Shtark MB.	Induction of long-term posttetanic potentiation in rat hippocampal CA1 filed was followed by a decrease in the content of transcription factor p53 against the background of unchanged level of p53 mRNA, which implies activation of negative regulators of p53. Mdm2 is an important regulator of p53. We studied the effects of Mdm2 inhibitor nutlin-3 on p53 expression during generation of long-term posttetanic potentiation. Mdm2 inhibition completely prevented tetanization-induced decrease in the content of p53 protein; the level of p53 mRNA tended to increase in 30 min after tetanization. Thus, Mdm2 contributes to the maintenance of constant level of mRNA and plays a pivotal role in the decrease in the level of p53 protein during induction of long-term potentiation.
25960041	Hitting cancers' weak spots: vulnerabilities imposed by p53 mutation.	Gurpinar E, Vousden KH.	The tumor suppressor protein p53 plays a critical role in limiting malignant development and progression. Almost all cancers show loss of p53 function, through either mutation in the p53 gene itself or defects in the mechanisms that activate p53. While reactivation of p53 can effectively limit tumor growth, this is a difficult therapeutic goal to achieve in the many cancers that do not retain wild type p53. An alternative approach focuses on identifying vulnerabilities imposed on cancers by virtue of the loss of or alterations in p53, to identify additional pathways that can be targeted to specifically kill or inhibit the growth of p53 mutated cells. These indirect ways of exploiting mutations in p53 - which occur in more than half of all human cancers - provide numerous exciting therapeutic possibilities.
25728495	Structure of full-length p53 tumor suppressor probed by chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry.	Arlt C, Ihling CH, Sinz A.	The tumor suppressor p53 presents a great challenge for 3D structural analysis due to its inherent flexibility. In this work, we gained insight into the structure of full-length wild-type human p53 in solution by chemical cross-linking/MS. This approach allowed us obtaining structural information of free wild-type p53 in solution without making use of the ultrastable quadruple p53 variant. The cross-links within one p53 monomer are in good agreement with the small-angle X-ray scattering based model of full-length p53. Our cross-linking data between different p53 molecules in the tetramer however indicate a large degree of flexibility in the C-terminal regulatory domain of full-length p53 in the absence of DNA. The cross-links suggest that the C-terminal regulatory domains are much closer to each other, resulting in a more compact arrangement of the p53 tetramer than perceived by the small-angle X-ray scattering model.
24898668	Ellipticine induces apoptosis in T-cell lymphoma via oxidative DNA damage.	Savorani C, Manfé V, Biskup E, Gniadecki R.	The tumor suppressor p53 is often mutated in human cancers. Restoring its antitumor activity has been shown to be a promising therapeutic approach for cancer treatment. Here we analyzed the activity and mechanism of a p53 reactivator, ellipticine, in a cellular model of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), a disease that is progressive, chemoresistant and refractory to treatment. We tested the effect of ellipticine in three cell lines with different p53 status: MyLa2000 (p53(wt/wt)), SeAx ((G245S)p53) and Hut-78 ((R196Stop)p53). Ellipticine caused apoptosis in MyLa2000 and SeAx and restored the transcriptional activity of (G245S)p53 in SeAx. However, p53 siRNA knockdown experiments revealed that p53 was not required for ellipticine-induced apoptosis in CTCL. The lipophilic antioxidant α-tocopherol inhibited ellipticine-dependent apoptosis and we linked the apoptotic response to the oxidative DNA damage. Our results provide evidence that ellipticine-induced apoptosis is exerted through DNA damage and does not require p53 activation in T-cell lymphoma.
26132471	Transcription factors that interact with p53 and Mdm2.	Inoue K, Fry EA, Frazier DP.	The tumor suppressor p53 is activated upon cellular stresses such as DNA damage, oncogene activation, hypoxia, which transactivates sets of genes that induce DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, or autophagy, playing crucial roles in the prevention of tumor formation. The central regulator of the p53 pathway is Mdm2 which inhibits transcriptional activity, nuclear localization, and protein stability. More than 30 cellular p53-binding proteins have been isolated and characterized including Mdm2, Mdm4, p300, BRCA1/2, ATM, ABL, and 53BP-1/2. Most of them are nuclear proteins; however, not much is known about p53-binding transcription factors. In this review, we focus on transcription factors that directly interact with p53/Mdm2 through direct binding including Dmp1, E2F1, YB-1, and YY1. Dmp1 and YB-1 bind only to p53 while E2F1 and YY1 bind to both p53 and Mdm2. Dmp1 has been shown to bind to p53 and block all the known functions for Mdm2 on p53 inhibition, providing a secondary mechanism for tumor suppression in Arf-null cells. Although E2F1-p53 binding provides a checkpoint mechanism to silence hyperactive E2F1, YB-1 or YY1 interaction with p53 subverts the activity of p53, contributing to cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis. Thus, the modes and consequences for each protein-protein interaction vary from the viewpoint of tumor development and suppression. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
25719246	p53 is active in murine stem cells and alters the transcriptome in a manner that is reminiscent of mutant p53.	Yan H, Solozobova V, Zhang P, Armant O, Kuehl B, Brenner-Weiss G, Blattner C.	Since it was found that p53 is highly expressed in murine embryonic stem cells, it remained a mystery whether p53 is active in this cell type. We show that a significant part of p53 is localised in the nucleus of murine embryonic stem cells and that the majority of this nuclear p53 is bound to DNA. According to its nuclear localisation, we show that p53 alters the transcriptional program of stem cells. Nevertheless, the anti-proliferative activity of p53 is compromised in stem cells, and this control is due, at least in part, to the high amount of MdmX that is present in embryonic stem cells and bound to p53. Instead of the anti-proliferative activity that p53 has in differentiated cells, p53 controls transcription of pro-proliferative genes in embryonic stem cells including c-myc and c-jun. The impeded anti-proliferative activity of p53 and the induction of certain proto-oncogenes by p53 in murine embryonic stem cells can explain why stem cells proliferate efficiently despite having high levels of p53.
25692950	Amyloidogenicity of p53: a hidden link between protein misfolding and cancer.	Gong H, Yang X, Zhao Y, Petersen RB, Liu X, Liu Y, Huang K.	Pathogenic aggregation is closely associated with various protein misfolding diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer's disease. Amyloidogenic proteins that have a propensity to assemble into amyloid oligomers and fibrils form the aggregates. The tumor suppressor p53, a transcription factor that regulates the cell cycle and apoptosis, is also amyloidogenic. In tumor models, both wild type and mutant p53 proteins show aggregation kinetics and morphology similar to those of classical amyloidogenic proteins, such as β-amyloid peptide and α- synuclein. Wild type p53 loses its anticancer activity when it aggregates, while p53 mutants with enhanced amyloidogenicity show accelerated aggregation. So far, amyloidogenic p53 mutations have been implicated in more than ten different types of cancer, suggesting a connection between p53 aggregation and cancer. Therefore, inhibition of both inherent and mutation induced p53 aggregation may stabilize p53 in a functional conformation and provide a novel approach to cancer prevention and treatment. Here, we summarize recent findings on carcinogenic aggregation of wild type p53 and its clinical mutants, structure-dependent amyloidogenesis of p53, and several promising strategies based on inhibition of p53 aggregation are also discussed.
25146923	Genotoxic stress/p53-induced DNAJB9 inhibits the pro-apoptotic function of p53.	Lee HJ, Kim JM, Kim KH, Heo JI, Kwak SJ, Han JA.	DNAJB9 is a recently isolated member of the molecular chaperone gene family, whose precise function is largely unknown. In the present study, we have identified DNAJB9 as an inducible gene of the tumor suppressor p53. DNAJB9 expression was induced by p53 or genotoxic stress in a p53-dependent manner, which was mediated by the Ras/Raf/ERK pathway. In addition, depletion of DNAJB9 by using siRNAs greatly increased genotoxic stress/p53-induced apoptosis, suggesting that DNAJB9 inhibits the pro-apoptotic function of p53. We also found that DNAJB9 physically interacts with p53 through its J domain, through which it inhibits the pro-apoptotic function of p53. Moreover, DNAJB9 colocalized with p53 in both cytoplasm and nucleus under genotoxic conditions. Together, these results demonstrate that DNAJB9 is a downstream target of p53 that belongs to the group of negative feedback regulators of p53.
26397130	p53-mediated control of gene expression via mRNA translation during Endoplasmic Reticulum stress.	López I, Tournillon AS, Nylander K, Fåhraeus R.	p53 is activated by different stress and damage pathways and regulates cell biological responses including cell cycle arrest, repair pathways, apoptosis and senescence. Following DNA damage, the levels of p53 increase and via binding to target gene promoters, p53 induces expression of multiple genes including p21(CDKN1A) and mdm2. The effects of p53 on gene expression during the DNA damage response are well mimicked by overexpressing p53 under normal conditions. However, stress to the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and the consequent Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) leads to the induction of the p53/47 isoform that lacks the first 40 aa of p53 and to an active suppression of p21(CDKN1A) transcription and mRNA translation. We now show that during ER stress p53 also suppresses MDM2 protein levels via a similar mechanism. These observations not only raise questions about the physiological role of MDM2 during ER stress but it also reveals a new facet of p53 as a repressor toward 2 of its major target genes during the UPR. As suppression of p21(CDKN1A) and MDM2 protein synthesis is mediated via their coding sequences, it raises the possibility that p53 controls mRNA translation via a common mechanism that might play an important role in how p53 regulates gene expression during the UPR, as compared to the transcription-dependent gene regulation taking place during the DNA damage response.
26413214	Regulation of p53 oligomerization by Ras superfamily protein RBEL1A.	Lui K, Sheikh MS, Huang Y.	Our previous studies showed that RBEL1A overexpressed in multiple human malignancies and its depletion by RNAi caused severe growth inhibition in tumor cells. We also showed that RBEL1A directly interacted with p53 and such interactions occurred at the oligomeric domain of p53. However, the effect of such interactions on p53 oligomerization and function remained to be investigated. Here, we report that the interaction of RBEL1A and p53 suppressed p53 oligomer formation in unstressed cells and in cells exposed to DNA damage. Furthermore, purified RBEL1A blocked the oligomerization of recombinant p53 corresponding to residues 315-360 in vitro. RBEL1A also significantly reduced the oligomerization of the exogenously expressed C-terminal region (residues 301-393) of p53 in cells. Overexpression of RBEL1A (as seen in human tumors), also suppressed oligomerization by endogenous p53. Our results also showed that GTPase domain of RBEL1A at residues 1-235 was sufficient to block p53 oligomerization. Furthermore, silencing of endogenous RBEL1A significantly enhanced the formation of p53 oligomeric complex following ultraviolet radiation-mediated DNA damage and RBEL1A knockdown also enhanced expression of p53 target genes. Taken together, our studies provide important new molecular insights into the regulation of p53 and the oncogenic role of RBEL1A in the context to human malignancy.Elevated RBEL1A expression in human tumors could negatively regulate p53 by inhibiting its tetramerization.
26294215	Small-Molecule NSC59984 Restores p53 Pathway Signaling and Antitumor Effects against Colorectal Cancer via p73 Activation and Degradation of Mutant p53.	Zhang S, Zhou L, Hong B, van den Heuvel AP, Prabhu VV, Warfel NA, Kline CL, Dicker DT, Kopelovich L, El-Deiry WS.	The tumor-suppressor p53 prevents cancer development via initiating cell-cycle arrest, cell death, repair, or antiangiogenesis processes. Over 50% of human cancers harbor cancer-causing mutant p53. p53 mutations not only abrogate its tumor-suppressor function, but also endow mutant p53 with a gain of function (GOF), creating a proto-oncogene that contributes to tumorigenesis, tumor progression, and chemo- or radiotherapy resistance. Thus, targeting mutant p53 to restore a wild-type p53 signaling pathway provides an attractive strategy for cancer therapy. We demonstrate that small-molecule NSC59984 not only restores wild-type p53 signaling, but also depletes mutant p53 GOF. NSC59984 induces mutant p53 protein degradation via MDM2 and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. NSC59984 restores wild-type p53 signaling via p73 activation, specifically in mutant p53-expressing colorectal cancer cells. At therapeutic doses, NSC59984 induces p73-dependent cell death in cancer cells with minimal genotoxicity and without evident toxicity toward normal cells. NSC59984 synergizes with CPT11 to induce cell death in mutant p53-expressing colorectal cancer cells and inhibits mutant p53-associated colon tumor xenograft growth in a p73-dependent manner in vivo. We hypothesize that specific targeting of mutant p53 may be essential for anticancer strategies that involve the stimulation of p73 in order to efficiently restore tumor suppression. Taken together, our data identify NSC59984 as a promising lead compound for anticancer therapy that acts by targeting GOF-mutant p53 and stimulates p73 to restore the p53 pathway signaling.

25311384	Mutant p53 stimulates chemoresistance of pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells to gemcitabine.	Fiorini C, Cordani M, Padroni C, Blandino G, Di Agostino S, Donadelli M.	Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide; PDAC is characterized by poor prognosis, resistance to conventional chemotherapy and high mortality rate. TP53 tumor suppressor gene is frequently mutated in PDAC, resulting in the accumulation of mutated protein with potential gain-of-function (GOF) activities, such as genomic instability, hyperproliferation and chemoresistance. The purpose of this study was to assess the relevance of the p53 status on the PDAC cells response to the standard drug gemcitabine. We also examined the potential therapeutic effect of p53-reactivating molecules to restore the mutant p53 function in GEM treated PDAC cells. We showed that gemcitabine stabilized mutant p53 protein in the nuclei and induced chemoresistance, concurrent with the mutant p53-dependent expression of Cdk1 and CCNB1 genes, resulting in a hyperproliferation effect. Despite the adverse activation of mutant p53 by gemcitabine, simultaneous treatment of PDAC cells with gemcitabine and p53-reactivating molecules (CP-31398 and RITA) reduced growth rate and induced apoptosis. This synergistic effect was observed in both wild-type and mutant p53 cell lines and was absent in p53-null cells. The combination drug treatment induced p53 phosphorylation on Ser15, apoptosis and autophagosome formation. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy further increased apoptosis stimulated by gemcitabine/CP-31398 treatment. Together, our results show that gemcitabine aberrantly stimulates mutant p53 activity in PDAC cells identifying key processes with potential for therapeutic targeting. Our data also support an anti-tumoral strategy based on inhibition of autophagy combined with p53 activation and standard chemotherapy for both wild-type and mutant p53 expressing PDACs.
25965802	An unexpected inhibition of antiviral signaling by virus-encoded tumor suppressor p53 in pancreatic cancer cells.	Hastie E, Cataldi M, Steuerwald N, Grdzelishvili VZ.	Virus-encoded tumor suppressor p53 transgene expression has been successfully used in vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and other oncolytic viruses (OVs) to enhance their anticancer activities. However, p53 is also known to inhibit virus replication via enhanced type I interferon (IFN) antiviral responses. To examine whether p53 transgenes enhance antiviral signaling in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, we engineered novel VSV recombinants encoding human p53 or the previously described chimeric p53-CC, which contains the coiled-coil (CC) domain from breakpoint cluster region (BCR) protein and evades the dominant-negative activities of endogenously expressed mutant p53. Contrary to an expected enhancement of antiviral signaling by p53, our global analysis of gene expression in PDAC cells showed that both p53 and p53-CC dramatically inhibited type I IFN responses. Our data suggest that this occurs through p53-mediated inhibition of the NF-κB pathway. Importantly, VSV-encoded p53 or p53-CC did not inhibit antiviral signaling in non-malignant human pancreatic ductal cells, which retained their resistance to all tested VSV recombinants. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of p53-mediated inhibition of antiviral signaling, and it suggests that OV-encoded p53 can simultaneously produce anticancer activities while assisting, rather than inhibiting, virus replication in cancer cells.
25810107	Mutant p53 expression in fallopian tube epithelium drives cell migration.	Quartuccio SM, Karthikeyan S, Eddie SL, Lantvit DD, Ó hAinmhire E, Modi DA, Wei JJ, Burdette JE.	Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death among US women. Evidence supports the hypothesis that high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSC) may originate in the distal end of the fallopian tube. Although a heterogeneous disease, 96% of HGSC contain mutations in p53. In addition, the "p53 signature," or overexpression of p53 protein (usually associated with mutation), is a potential precursor lesion of fallopian tube derived HGSC suggesting an essential role for p53 mutation in early serous tumorigenesis. To further clarify p53-mutation dependent effects on cells, murine oviductal epithelial cells (MOE) were stably transfected with a construct encoding for the R273H DNA binding domain mutation in p53, the most common mutation in HGSC. Mutation in p53 was not sufficient to transform MOE cells but did significantly increase cell migration. A similar p53 mutation in murine ovarian surface epithelium (MOSE), another potential progenitor cell for serous cancer, was not sufficient to transform the cells nor change migration suggesting tissue specific effects of p53 mutation. Microarray data confirmed expression changes of pro-migratory genes in p53(R273H) MOE compared to parental cells, which could be reversed by suppressing Slug expression. Combining p53(R273H) with KRAS(G12V) activation caused transformation of MOE into high-grade sarcomatoid carcinoma when xenografted into nude mice. Elucidating the specific role of p53(R273H) in the fallopian tube will improve understanding of changes at the earliest stage of transformation. This information can help develop chemopreventative strategies to prevent the accumulation of additional mutations and reverse progression of the "p53 signature" thereby, improving survival rates.
25823026	PPM1D phosphatase, a target of p53 and RBM38 RNA-binding protein, inhibits p53 mRNA translation via dephosphorylation of RBM38.	Zhang M, Xu E, Zhang J, Chen X.	PPM1D phosphatase, also called wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1, promotes tumor development by inactivating the p53 tumor suppressor pathway. RBM38 RNA-binding protein, also called RNPC1 and a target of p53, inhibits p53 messenger RNA (mRNA) translation, which can be reversed by GSK3 protein kinase via phosphorylation of RBM38 at serine 195. Here we showed that ectopic expression of RBM38 increases, whereas knockdown of RBM38 inhibits, PPM1D mRNA translation. Consistent with this, we found that RBM38 directly binds to PPM1D 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) and promotes expression of a heterologous reporter gene that carries PPM1D 3'-UTR in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, we showed that PPM1D directly interacts with and dephosphorylates RBM38 at serine 195. Furthermore, we showed that PPM1D modulates p53 mRNA translation and p53-dependent growth suppression through dephosphorylation of RBM38. These findings provide evidence that the crosstalk between PPM1D and RBM38, both of which are targets and modulators of p53, has a critical role in p53 expression and activity.Oncogene advance online publication, 30 March 2015; doi:10.1038/onc.2015.31.
26075053	New tricks for p53 regulation - restraint by protein coding RNAs.	Blattner C.	P53 is most well-known for its tumor suppressive function in differentiated cells. Its activities in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are, however, less well understood. For many years it was thought that p53 is not active at all in ESCs and unable to elicit a DNA damage response in this cell type. In the last few years, it emerged that p53 may have some functions in ESCs. Nevertheless, it remained a mystery how its activity is controlled in ESCs. A recent report demonstrates that p53 activity is regulated by a novel RNA-containing negative feedback loop that promotes apoptosis specifically in ESCs. This study not only demonstrates unequivocally that p53 is active in ESCs, it further illustrates a novel mechanism of gene regulation-by protein coding RNAs.
25308263	Detection of p53 protein aggregation in cancer cell lines and tumor samples.	Yang-Hartwich Y, Bingham J, Garofalo F, Alvero AB, Mor G.	The p53 protein plays a central role in regulating apoptosis. The loss of functional p53 is common in many cancers. In cancer cells, the dysfunctional p53 protein often maintains a misfolded, inactive conformation due to genetic mutations or posttranslational deregulation. The misfolded p53 protein can aggregate and form amyloid-like oligomers and fibrils, which abrogate the pro-apoptotic functions of p53. Therefore, the aggregation of p53 may be a crucial factor in carcinogenesis, tumor progression, and the response of cancer cells to apoptotic signals. In this chapter, we provide details on various methods for detecting p53 aggregation in cancer cell lines and tumor samples.
25308293	Activation of p53-dependent/-independent pathways of apoptotic cell death by chelerythrine in a murine T cell lymphoma.	Kumar S, Tomar MS, Acharya A.	The p53 tumor suppressor protein has been implicated as an activator of apoptosis. In order to investigate the effect of chelerythrine and staurosporine on the activation of p53-dependent/-independent pathways of Dalton lymphoma (DL) cell death, cells were treated with chelerythrine and staurosporine for 1 h, 3 h and 6 h, respectively. It was found that treatment with chelerythrine and staurosporine increased the expression of total-p53/phospho-53 (ser-15) significantly at protein and mRNA levels, which resulted in activation of the p53-dependent apoptotic pathway in DL cells. In addition, increased activities of cyt-c, caspase-9 and caspase-3 and degradation of DNA into fragments confirmed activation of the p53-independent apoptotic pathway in p53 knockdown RNAi-DL cells. In brief, the present study demonstrated activation of p53-dependent/-independent apoptotic pathways in DL cells. Therefore, targeting of p53-dependent/-independent apoptotic pathways may lead to the possibility of designing and developing better therapeutic regimens to treat DL and other human cancers.
25618545	The role of DNA damage responses in p53 biology.	Speidel D.	The tumour suppressor p53 is a central player in cellular DNA damage responses. P53 is upregulated and activated by genotoxic stress and induces a transcriptional programme with effectors promoting apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, senescence and DNA repair. For the best part of the last three decades, these DNA damage-related programmes triggered by p53 were unequivocally regarded as the major if not sole mechanism by which p53 exerts its tumour suppressor function. However, this interpretation has been challenged by a number of recent in vivo studies, demonstrating that mice which are defective in inducing p53-dependent apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and senescence suppress thymic lymphoma as well as wild-type p53 expressing animals. Consequently, the importance of DNA damage responses for p53-mediated tumour suppression has been questioned. In this review, I summarize current knowledge on p53-controlled DNA damage responses and argue that these activities, while their role has certainly changed, remain an important feature of p53 biology with relevance for cancer therapy and tumour suppression.
26452131	The tissue dependent interactions between p53 and Bcl-2 in vivo.	Li X, Miao X, Wang H, Xu Z, Li B.	To further investigate the role of p53 in apoptosis in vivo and the interaction between p53 and Bcl-2 in the regulation of cellular apoptosis in vivo, we depleted p53 in Bcl-2-null mice. We found that the interaction between p53 and Bcl-2 are tissue dependent. Specifically, loss of p53 in Bcl-2-/- mice inhibits apoptotic induction in spleen and subsequently inhibits the Bcl-2-null-induced spleen atrophy. Furthermore, p53 deficiency overcomes loss of melanocyte stem cell (MSC)-induced apoptosis and subsequently prevents hair graying in Bcl-2- null mice. In addition, p53 deletion partly inhibits apoptosis in hair follicle keratinocytes, leading to the alleviation of hair growth delay in Bcl-2-null mice. However, p53 absence in Bcl-2-null mice cannot restore other defects in Bcl-2-null mice, including retardation of growth, short ears and polycystic kidney disease.
25867071	Negative regulation of the p300-p53 interplay by DDX24.	Shi D, Dai C, Qin J, Gu W.	Numerous studies indicate that p300 acts as a key transcriptional cofactor in vivo, at least, in part, by modulating activities of p53 by acetylation. Nevertheless, the regulation of the p53-p300 interplay is not completely understood. Here, we have identified the DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box RNA helicase 24 (DDX24) as a novel regulator of the p300-p53 axis. We found that DDX24 interacts with p300, and this interaction leads to suppression of p300-mediated acetylation of p53. Notably, RNA interference-mediated knockdown of endogenous DDX24 significantly increases the acetylation levels of endogenous p53 in human cancer cells and subsequently promotes p53-mediated activation of its transcriptional targets such as p21 and p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA). In contrast, DDX24 expression inhibits the p300-p53 interaction and suppresses p300-mediated acetylation of p53. Moreover, DDX24 is overexpressed in human cancer cells and reduction of DDX24 protein levels by RNA interference induces cell cycle arrest and senescence in a p53-dependent manner. These results reveal DDX24 as an important regulator of p300 and suggest that the modulation of the p53-p300 interplay by DDX24 is critical in controlling p53 activities in human cancer cells.Oncogene advance online publication, 13 April 2015; doi:10.1038/onc.2015.77.
25591766	RNF125 is a ubiquitin-protein ligase that promotes p53 degradation.	Yang L, Zhou B, Li X, Lu Z, Li W, Huo X, Miao Z.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Although early studies show that Mdm2 is the primary E3 ubiquitin ligase for the p53 tumor suppressor, an increasing amount of data suggests that p53 ubiquitination and degradation are more complex than once thought. Here, we investigated the role of RNF125, a non-Mdm2 ubiquitin-protein ligase, in the regulation of p53. METHODS AND RESULTS: RNF125 physically interacted with p53 in exogenous/endogenous co-immunoprecipitation (IP) and GST-pull down assay, and a C72/75A mutation of RNF125 did not interfere with this interaction. Expression of RNF125 decreased the level of p53 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas knockdown of RNF125 by RNA interference increased the level of p53. As shown by Western blotting and ubiquitin assay, RNF125 ubiquitinated p53 and targeted it for proteasome degradation. Furthermore, RNF125 repressed p53 functions including p53-dependent transactivation and growth inhibition. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that RNF125 negatively regulates p53 function through physical interaction and ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation.
25573952	Mutant p53 Amplifies Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Family Signaling to Promote Mammary Tumorigenesis.	Yallowitz AR, Li D, Lobko A, Mott D, Nemajerova A, Marchenko N.	The EGFR family (ErbB2/Her2 and EGFR/ErbB1/Her1) often modulates the transcriptional program involved in promoting mammary tumorigenesis. In humans, the majority of ErbB2-positive sporadic breast cancers harbor p53 mutations, which correlate with poor prognosis. Also, the extremely high incidence of ErbB2-positive breast cancer in women with p53 germline mutations (Li-Fraumeni syndrome) suggests a key role of mutant p53 specifically in ErbB2-mediated mammary tumorigenesis. To examine the role of mutant p53 during ErbB2-mediated mammary tumorigenesis, a mutant p53 allele (R172H) was introduced into the (MMTV)-ErbB2/Neu mouse model system. Interestingly, we show in heterozygous p53 mice that mutant p53 R172H is a more potent activator of ErbB2-mediated mammary tumorigenesis than simple loss of p53. The more aggressive disease in mutant p53 animals was reflected by earlier tumor onset, increased mammary tumor multiplicity, and shorter survival. These in vivo and in vitro data provide mechanistic evidence that mutant p53 amplifies ErbB2 and EGFR signaling to promote the expansion of mammary stem cells and induce cell proliferation.This study identifies mutant p53 as an essential player in ErbB2 and EGFR-mediated mammary tumorigenesis and indicates the potential translational importance of targeting mutant p53 in this subset of patients with breast cancer.
26595675	Indirect p53-dependent transcriptional repression of Survivin, CDC25C, and PLK1 genes requires the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21/CDKN1A and CDE/CHR promoter sites binding the DREAM complex.	Fischer M, Quaas M, Nickel A, Engeland K.	The transcription factor p53 is central to cell cycle control by downregulation of cell cycle-promoting genes upon cell stress such as DNA damage. Survivin (BIRC5), CDC25C, and PLK1 encode important cell cycle regulators that are repressed following p53 activation. Here, we provide evidence that p53-dependent repression of these genes requires activation of p21 (CDKN1A, WAF1, CIP1). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) data indicate that promoter binding of B-MYB switches to binding of E2F4 and p130 resulting in a replacement of the MMB (Myb-MuvB) by the DREAM complex. We demonstrate that this replacement depends on p21. Furthermore, transcriptional repression by p53 requires intact DREAM binding sites in the target promoters. The CDE and CHR cell cycle promoter elements are the sites for DREAM binding. These elements as well as the p53 response of Survivin, CDC25C, and PLK1 are evolutionarily conserved. No binding of p53 to these genes is detected by ChIP and mutation of proposed p53 binding sites does not alter the p53 response. Thus, a mechanism for direct p53-dependent transcriptional repression is not supported by the data. In contrast, repression by DREAM is consistent with most previous findings and unifies models based on p21-, E2F4-, p130-, and CDE/CHR-dependent repression by p53. In conclusion, the presented data suggest that the p53-p21-DREAM-CDE/CHR pathway regulates p53-dependent repression of Survivin, CDC25C, and PLK1.
25912675	Hyperglycemia promotes p53-Mdm2 interaction but reduces p53 ubiquitination in RINm5F cells.	Barzalobre-Gerónimo R, Flores-López LA, Baiza-Gutman LA, Cruz M, García-Macedo R, Ávalos-Rodríguez A, Contreras-Ramos A, Díaz-Flores A, Ortega-Camarillo C.	The apoptosis of β cells induced by hyperglycemia has been associated with p53 mobilization to mitochondria and p53 phosphorylation. Murine double minute 2 (Mdm2) induces the degradation of p53 and thereby protects cells from apoptosis. We studied the effect of glucose at high concentration on the ability of Mdm2 to ubiquitinate p53 and promote its degradation. RINm5F cells were grown in RPMI-1640 medium with 5 or 30 mM glucose for varying periods of time. After this treatment, the expression of Mdm2 was measured using real-time PCR. The phosphorylation of Mdm2 at Ser166, p53 at Ser15, and the kinases Akt and ATM were measured by Western blotting. The formation of the p53-Mdm2 complex and p53 ubiquitination was assessed by p53 immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence. Our results showed that high glucose reduced Mdm2 mRNA expression and protein concentration and increased Mdm2 and Akt phosphorylation, albeit with slower kinetics for Akt. It also promoted p53-Mdm2 complex formation, whereas p53 ubiquitination was suppressed. Furthermore, phosphorylation of both p53 Ser15 and ATM was increased in the presence of 30 mM glucose. These data indicate that high concentration glucose decrease the mRNA expression and cytosolic concentration of Mdm2. However, although the increase in glucose promoted the phosphorylation of Mdm2, it also decreased p53 ubiquitination, thus avoiding p53 degradation. In hyperglycemic conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, the reduction of pancreatic β cells mass is favored by stabilization of p53 in association with low p53 ubiquitination and reduced expression of Mdm2.
25989210	Actinomycin D and nutlin-3a synergistically promote phosphorylation of p53 on serine 46 in cancer cell lines of different origin.	Zajkowicz A, Gdowicz-Kłosok A, Krześniak M, Ścieglińska D, Rusin M.	The p53 tumor suppressor protein is a transcription factor activated by phosphorylation of its N-terminus. MDM2, encoded by a p53-activated gene, acts as a negative-feedback regulator of p53 by promoting p53 degradation. Moreover, MDM2 inhibits p53 by binding to and concealing its N-terminal transcription-activating domain. p53 can be activated by nutlin-3a, a molecule designed to bind MDM2 and prevent its interaction with p53. Actinomycin D promotes phosphorylation and accumulation of p53 via a mechanism that involves high expression of MDM2. We hypothesized that co-treatment of cells with actinomycin D and nutlin-3a would lead to synergistic activation of p53 by stimulating kinases and preventing accumulated MDM2 from binding to p53. Indeed, co-treatment of various cell lines with actinomycin D and nutlin-3a resulted in a synergistic increase of p53 phosphorylation on serine 46. We focused on this residue because it is a marker of the highest level of p53 activation. Co-treatment was associated with conspicuous decrease in a marker of mTOR activity in NCI-H28 cells and very strong activation of p53 targets, including CDKN1A and PML, in A549 cells. Other p53 target genes (SESN1, SESN2, TIGAR, DRAM1) were also efficiently upregulated; however, a marker of apoptosis (active caspase-3) appeared only in some cancer cell lines (e.g., A375 and other cell lines derived from melanoma) indicating that phosphorylation of p53 on serine 46 is not straightforwardly associated with induction of apoptosis. Moreover, our data suggest that melanoma may be a suitable target for drug combination used in this study.
25667043	Effect of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase and DNA topoisomerase I inhibitors on the p53/p63-dependent survival of carcinoma cells.	Montariello D, Troiano A, Di Girolamo D, Beneke S, Calabrò V, Quesada P.	Depending on their genetic background (p53(wt) versus p53(null)), carcinoma cells are more or less sensitive to drug-induced cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. Among the members of the p53 family, p63 is characterized by two N-terminal isoforms, TAp63 and ΔNp63. TAp63 isoform has p53-like functions, while ΔNp63 acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of p53. We have previously published that TAp63 is involved in poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 (PARP-1) signaling of DNA damage deriving from DNA topoisomerase I (TOP I) inhibition in carcinoma cells. In the present study, we treated MCF7 breast carcinoma cells (p53(+)/ΔNp63(-)) or SCC022 (p53(-)/ΔNp63(+)) squamous carcinoma cells with the TOP I inhibitor topotecan (TPT) and the PJ34 PARP inhibitor, to compare their effects in the two different cell contexts. In MCF7 cells, we found that PJ34 addition reverts TPT-dependent PARP-1 auto-modification and triggers caspase-dependent PARP-1 proteolysis. Moreover, TPT as single agent stimulates p53(ser15) phosphorylation, p53 PARylation and occupancy of the p21WAF promoter by p53 resulting in an increase of p21WAF expression. Interestingly, PJ34 in combination with TPT enhances p53 occupancy at the BAX promoter and is associated with increased BAX protein level. In SCC022 cells, instead, TPT+PJ34 combined treatment reduces the level of the anti-apoptotic ΔNp63α protein without inducing apoptosis. Remarkably, in such cells, either exogenous p53 or TAp63 can rescue the apoptotic program in response to the treatment. All together our results suggest that in cancer cells PARP inhibitor(s) can operate in the choice between growth arrest and apoptosis by modulating p53 family-dependent signal.
26530780	Adenovirus-mediated p53 and ING4 gene co‑transfer elicits synergistic antitumor effects through enhancement of p53 acetylation in breast cancer.	Wu J, Zhu Y, Xu C, Xu H, Zhou X, Yang J, Xie Y, Tao M.	Multigene-based combination therapy may be an effective practice in cancer gene therapy. Substantial studies have demonstrated that tumor suppressor p53 acetylation is indispensable for p53 activation. Inhibitor of growth 4 (ING4), as a novel tumor suppressor, is capable of remarkably enhancing p53 acetylation and its transcriptional activity. Hence, we assumed that combined treatment of p53 and ING4 double tumor suppressors would exhibit enhanced antitumor effects. The combined therapeutic efficacy of p53 and ING4 for human cancers has not been previously reported. We thus generated multiple promoter expression cassette-based recombinant adenovirus-co-expressing ING4 and p53 double tumor suppressor genes (AdVING4/p53), evaluated the combined effects of AdVING4/p53 on breast cancer using the MDA-MB-231 (mutant p53) human breast cancer cell line, and also elucidated its underlying molecular mechanisms. We demonstrated that AdVING4/p53-mediated p53 and ING4 co-expression induced synergistic growth inhibition and apoptosis as well as enhanced effects on upregulation of acetylated p53, P21, Bax, PUMA, Noxa, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP, and downregulation of Bcl-2, CD31 and microvessel density (MVD) in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer in vitro and/or in vivo subcutaneous (s.c.) xenografted tumors. The synergistic antitumor activity elicited by AdVING4/p53 was closely associated with the enhanced activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and synergistic inhibition of tumor angiogenesis, very possibly via ING4-mediated enhancement of p53 acetylation and activity. Thus, our results indicate that cancer gene therapy combining two or more tumor suppressors such as p53 and ING4 may constitute a novel and effective therapeutic modality for human breast cancer and other cancers.
25433195	Mathematical modelling of p53 basal dynamics and DNA damage response.	Chong KH, Samarasinghe S, Kulasiri D.	The p53 tumour suppressor protein is a transcription factor that activates genes that result in cell cycle arrest, DNA damage repair, senescence or apoptosis. Recent individual cell studies have indicated that p53 activation is highly regulated in response to stressed conditions and non-stressed (normal proliferating) conditions in cells. The aim of this research is to investigate the design principles behind the precise regulation of p53 activation, under normal and stressed conditions. We extended the Sun et al. (2011) mathematical model of delay differential equations by incorporating the most recently found molecular interactions and hypotheses. In particular, we found that the core regulatory network consists of ATM, Mdm2, MdmX, Wip1 and p53. Our model of the p53 core regulatory feedback mechanisms can reproduce a series of repeated pulses in stressed conditions with appropriate induction of cell cycle arrest, and one or two spontaneous pulses (basal dynamics) in non-stressed conditions and these are consistent with the recent experimental findings. Our results show that the p53 spontaneous pulses are due to intrinsic DNA double strand breaks in normal proliferating cells, and p53 auto-regulation (positive feedback loop) allows threshold activation of p53 in generating these pulses. It also shows that the p53 dynamics are excitable; bifurcation analysis revealed a spectrum of p53 behaviour under stressed and non-stressed (normal) conditions on the basis of stress signal activation rate, and characterised p53 dynamics as Type II excitability. Additionally, the model makes testable predictions on pharmacological intervention to reactivate p53. Importantly, we reveal novel findings on the mechanism of threshold activation of p53 pulsatile and oscillatory dynamics that are important for its physiological function as the guardian of the genome.
26205489	Regulation of the p53 response and its relationship to cancer.	Meek DW.	p53 has been studied intensively as a major tumour suppressor that detects oncogenic events in cancer cells and eliminates them through senescence (a permanent non-proliferative state) or apoptosis. Consistent with this role, p53 activity is compromised in a high proportion of all cancer types, either through mutation of the TP53 gene (encoding p53) or changes in the status of p53 modulators. p53 has additional roles, which may overlap with its tumour-suppressive capacity, in processes including the DNA damage response, metabolism, aging, stem cell differentiation and fertility. Moreover, many mutant p53 proteins, termed 'gain-of-function' (GOF), acquire new activities that help drive cancer aggression. p53 is regulated mainly through protein turnover and operates within a negative-feedback loop with its transcriptional target, MDM2 (murine double minute 2), an E3 ubiquitin ligase which mediates the ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of p53. Induction of p53 is achieved largely through uncoupling the p53-MDM2 interaction, leading to elevated p53 levels. Various stress stimuli acting on p53 (such as hyperproliferation and DNA damage) use different, but overlapping, mechanisms to achieve this. Additionally, p53 activity is regulated through critical context-specific or fine-tuning events, mediated primarily through post-translational mechanisms, particularly multi-site phosphorylation and acetylation. In the present review, I broadly examine these events, highlighting their regulatory contributions, their ability to integrate signals from cellular events towards providing most appropriate response to stress conditions and their importance for tumour suppression. These are fascinating aspects of molecular oncology that hold the key to understanding the molecular pathology of cancer and the routes by which it may be tackled therapeutically.
25158956	p53 Promotes cell survival due to the reversibility of its cell-cycle checkpoints.	Lukin DJ, Carvajal LA, Liu WJ, Resnick-Silverman L, Manfredi JJ.	The tumor suppressor p53 (TP53) has a well-studied role in triggering cell-cycle checkpoint in response to DNA damage. Previous studies have suggested that functional p53 enhances chemosensitivity. In contrast, data are presented to show that p53 can be required for cell survival following DNA damage due to activation of reversible cell-cycle checkpoints. The cellular outcome to DNA damage is determined by the duration and extent of the stimulus in a p53-dependent manner. In response to transient or low levels of DNA damage, p53 triggers a reversible G2 arrest, whereas a sustained p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest and senescence follows prolonged or high levels of DNA damage. Regardless of the length of treatment, p53-null cells arrest in G2, but ultimately adapt and proceed into mitosis. Interestingly, they fail to undergo cytokinesis, become multinucleated, and then die from apoptosis. Upon transient treatment with DNA-damaging agents, wild-type p53 cells reversibly arrest and repair the damage, whereas p53-null cells fail to do so and die. These data indicate that p53 can promote cell survival by inducing reversible cell-cycle arrest, thereby allowing for DNA repair. Thus, transient treatments may exploit differences between wild-type p53 and p53-null cells.Although p53 status has been suggested as a clinical predictor of chemotherapeutic efficacy, studies to date have not always supported this. This study demonstrates that p53 is still an important determinant of cell fate in response to chemotherapy, under the appropriate treatment conditions.
25697482	Mutant p53 (p53-R248Q) functions as an oncogene in promoting endometrial cancer by up-regulating REGγ.	Wang H, Bao W, Jiang F, Che Q, Chen Z, Wang F, Tong H, Dai C, He X, Liao Y, Liu B, Sun J, Wan X.	P53 mutation plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis of endometrial cancer (EC), here we report that the gain-of-function mutant p53-R248Q targets the proteasome activator REGγ to promote EC progression. Increased p53 expression significantly correlated with high pathological grade and lymph node metastasis in EC specimens. Manipulation of p53-R248Q in EC cells caused coincident changes in REGγ expression, and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with PCR further indicated that p53-R248Q bound to the REGγ gene promoter at a p53 responsive element. Silencing of REGγ in EC cells attenuated the cell proliferation, migration and invasion abilities, whereas overexpression of p53-R248Q rescued these activities. Overexpression of REGγ also induced an epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype. Moreover, a mouse xenograft tumor model showed that REGγ promoted tumor growth, further demonstrating a p53-R248Q-REGγ oncogenic pathway. Finally, examination of EC and normal endometrium specimens confirmed the oncogenic role of REGγ, in that REGγ was more highly overexpressed in p53-positive specimens than in p53-negative specimens. Our data suggest that REGγ is a promising therapeutic target for EC with the p53-R248Q mutation.
26586794	The presence of the intron 3 16bp duplication polymorphism of p53 (rs17878362) in breast cancer is associated with a low Δ40p53:p53 ratio and better outcome.	Morten BC, Wong-Brown MW, Scott RJ, Avery-Kiejda KA.	Breast cancer is the most common female cancer, but it has relatively low rates of p53 mutations, suggesting other mechanisms are responsible for p53 inactivation. We have shown that the p53 isoform, Δ40p53, is highly expressed in breast cancer, where it may contribute to p53 inactivation. Δ40p53 can be produced by alternative splicing of p53 in intron 2 and this is regulated by the formation of G-quadruplex structures in p53 intron 3, from which the nucleotides forming these structures overlap with a common polymorphism, rs17878362. rs17878362 alters p53 splicing to decrease fully-spliced p53 mRNA in vitro following ionising radiation and this in turn alters Δ40p53:p53. Hence, the presence of rs17878362 may be important in regulating Δ40p53:p53 in breast cancer. This study aimed to determine if rs17878362 was associated with altered Δ40p53 and p53 expression and outcome in breast cancer. We sequenced p53 in breast tumours from 139 patients and compared this to Δ40p53 and p53 mRNA expression. We found that the ratio of Δ40p53:p53 was significantly lower in tumours homozygous for the polymorphic A2 allele compared to those who were wild-type (A1/A1). Furthermore, there was a lower proportion of breast cancers carrying the A2 allele from patients who subsequently developed metastasis compared to those that did not. Finally, we show that patients whose tumours carried the polymorphic A2 allele had significantly better disease-free survival. These results show that rs17878362 is associated with a low Δ40p53:p53 ratio in breast cancer and that this is associated with better outcome.
25995995	The regulation of the p53/MDM2 feedback loop by microRNAs.	Zhang C, Liu J, Wang X, Feng Z.	Tumor suppressor p53 and its signaling pathway play a central role in tumor prevention. The E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2, which is a direct p53 transcriptional target and also the most critical negative regulator of p53, forms an autoregulatory negative feedback loop with p53 in the cell to tightly regulate the levels and activity of p53. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenously expressed small non-coding RNAs that play a critical role in the post-translational regulation of gene expression. Recent studies have revealed that miRNAs directly regulate the levels of p53 or MDM2 to modulate the p53 function in tumor suppression. Recently, we identified miR-339-5p as a new miRNA that directly represses MDM2 to activate p53 and enhance p53 function in tumor suppression. Thus, miRNAs have become a new but important component of the p53 signaling pathway through regulating the p53/MDM2 feedback loop.
26470484	[ROLE OF p53 IN THE REGULATION OF NEURONAL DIFFERENTIATION].	Glazova MB.	Beyond the well-known role of p53 as a tumor suppressor, an increasing number of data demonstrated the multiple roles of p53 in the regulation of various aspects of normal life. Diverse effects ofp53 based on different mechanisms its action, such as regulation of genes' transcription, protein-protein interactions and post-translation modifications. In this review, it was summarized recent studies on the mechanisms underlying the p53-dependent regulation of neuronal differentiation.
25695772	Comparison of effects of p53 null and gain-of-function mutations on salivary tumors in MMTV-Hras transgenic mice.	Jiang D, Dumur CI, Massey HD, Ramakrishnan V, Subler MA, Windle JJ.	p53 is an important tumor suppressor gene which is mutated in ~50% of all human cancers. Some of these mutants appear to have acquired novel functions beyond merely losing wild-type functions. To investigate these gain-of-function effects in vivo, we generated mice of three different genotypes: MMTV-Hras/p53(+/+), MMTV-Hras/p53(-/-), and MMTV-Hras/p53R172H/R172H. Salivary tumors from these mice were characterized with regard to age of tumor onset, tumor growth rates, cell cycle distribution, apoptotic levels, tumor histopathology, as well as response to doxorubicin treatment. Microarray analysis was also performed to profile gene expression. The MMTV-Hras/p53(-/-) and MMTV-Hras/p53R172H/R172H mice displayed similar properties with regard to age of tumor onset, tumor growth rates, tumor histopathology, and response to doxorubicin, while both groups were clearly distinct from the MMTV-Hras/p53(+/+) mice by these measurements. In addition, the gene expression profiles of the MMTV-Hras/p53(-/-) and MMTV-Hras/p53(R172H/R172H) tumors were tightly clustered, and clearly distinct from the profiles of the MMTV-Hras/p53(+/+) tumors. Only a small group of genes showing differential expression between the MMTV-Hras/p53(-/-) and MMTV-Hras/p53(R172H/R172H) tumors, that did not appear to be regulated by wild-type p53, were identified. Taken together, these results indicate that in this MMTV-Hras-driven salivary tumor model, the major effect of the p53 R172H mutant is due to the loss of wild-type p53 function, with little or no gain-of-function effect on tumorigenesis, which may be explained by the tissue- and tumor type-specific properties of this gain-of-function mutant of p53.
26218928	Dynamic roles of p53-mediated metabolic activities in ROS-induced stress responses.	Jiang L, Hickman JH, Wang SJ, Gu W.	The p53 tumor suppressor is a multifaceted polypeptide that impedes tumorigenesis by regulating a diverse array of cellular processes. Triggered by a wide variety of stress stimuli, p53 transcriptionally regulates genes involved in the canonical tumor suppression pathways of apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, and senescence. We recently discovered a novel mechanism whereby p53 inhibits cystine uptake through repression of the SLC7A11 gene to mediate ferroptosis. Importantly, this p53-SLC7A11 axis is preserved in the p53(3KR) mutant, and contributes to its ability to suppress tumorigenesis in the absence of the classical tumor suppression mechanisms. Here, we report that wild type p53 can induce both apoptosis and ferroptosis upon reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced stress. Furthermore, we demonstrate that p53's functional N-terminal domain is required for its capacity to regulate oxidative stress responses and ferroptosis. Notably, activated p53 dynamically modulates intracellular ROS, causing an initial reduction and a subsequent increase of ROS levels. Taken together, these data implicate ferroptosis as an additional component of the cell death program induced by wild type p53 in human cancer cells, and reveal a complex and dynamic role of p53 in oxidative stress responses.
26334721	Jmjd5 functions as a regulator of p53 signaling during mouse embryogenesis.	Ishimura A, Terashima M, Tange S, Suzuki T.	Genetic studies have shown that aberrant activation of p53 signaling leads to embryonic lethality. Maintenance of a fine balance of the p53 protein level is critical for normal development. Previously, we have reported that Jmjd5, a member of the Jumonji C (JmjC) family, regulates embryonic cell proliferation through the control of Cdkn1a expression. Since Cdkn1a is the representative p53-regulated gene, we have examined whether the expression of other p53 target genes is coincidentally upregulated with Cdkn1a in Jmjd5-deficient embryos. The expression of a subset of p53-regulated genes was increased in both Jmjd5 hypomorphic mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and Jmjd5-deficient embryos at embryonic day 8.25 without the induced expression of Trp53. Intercrossing of Jmjd5-deficient mice with Trp53 knockout mice showed that the growth defect of Jmjd5 mutant cells was significantly recovered under a Trp53 null genetic background. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis in Jmjd5 hypomorphic MEFs indicated the increased recruitment of p53 at several p53 target gene loci, such as Cdkn1a, Pmaip1, and Mdm2. These results suggest that Jmjd5 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of a subset of p53-regulated genes, possibly through the control of p53 recruitment at the gene loci. In Jmjd5-deficient embryos, the enhanced recruitment of p53 might result in the abnormal activation of p53 signaling leading to embryonic lethality.
25967122	Podocyte p53 Limits the Severity of Experimental Alport Syndrome.	Fukuda R, Suico MA, Kai Y, Omachi K, Motomura K, Koga T, Komohara Y, Koyama K, Yokota T, Taura M, Shuto T, Kai H.	Alport syndrome (AS) is one of the most common types of inherited nephritis caused by mutation in one of the glomerular basement membrane components. AS is characterized by proteinuria at early stage of the disease and glomerular hyperplastic phenotype and renal fibrosis at late stage. Here, we show that global deficiency of tumor suppressor p53 significantly accelerated AS progression in X-linked AS mice and decreased the lifespan of these mice. p53 protein expression was detected in 21-week-old wild-type mice but not in age-matched AS mice. Expression of proinflammatory cytokines and profibrotic genes was higher in p53(+/-) AS mice than in p53(+/+) AS mice. In vitro experiments revealed that p53 modulates podocyte migration and positively regulates the expression of podocyte-specific genes. We established podocyte-specific p53 (pod-p53)-deficient AS mice, and determined that pod-p53 deficiency enhanced the AS-induced renal dysfunction, foot process effacement, and alteration of gene-expression pattern in glomeruli. These results reveal a protective role of p53 in the progression of AS and in maintaining glomerular homeostasis by modulating the hyperplastic phenotype of podocytes in AS.
25219679	Genome wide expression analysis of radiation-induced DNA damage responses in isogenic HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116 p53-/- colorectal carcinoma cell lines.	Lindgren T, Stigbrand T, Råberg A, Riklund K, Johansson L, Eriksson D.	PURPOSE: To study the kinetics of gene expression alterations following radiation exposure of isogenic HCT116 p53 +/+ and HCT116 p53-/- cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cells were exposed to 5 Gy of irradiation (Cs-137) and genome-wide temporal expression analysis using Illumina bead chip arrays was performed. Signalling pathways were explored using Metacore (Genego). Biological responses including cell cycle checkpoint activation, centrosome amplification and senescence induction were analyzed. RESULTS: Significant differences in the radiation response were observed between the p53+/+ and the p53-/- cell lines. In p53+/+ cells concurrent G1- and G2-arrests were activated followed by senescence induction. Increased expression of genes associated with senescence, senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and repression of genes essential for G2-M transition were detected. P53-/- cells arrested mainly in G2 followed by centrosome amplification, mitotic slippage and a subsequent increase of polyploid cells. Furthermore, changes in expression correlated well with these signs of mitotic catastrophe. CONCLUSIONS: The presence or absence of p53 triggers different signalling cascades with different endpoints. Elucidating these differences is important as it enables improvement of radiation treatment and could be used to develop new combination treatments with specific inhibitors of key regulators of these cell death modalities.
25496374	Key points of basic theories and clinical practice in rAd-p53 ( Gendicine ™) gene therapy for solid malignant tumors.	Li Y, Li B, Li CJ, Li LJ.	INTRODUCTION: Wild-type p53 gene is an essential cancer suppressor gene which plays an important role in carcinogenesis and malignant progressions. The p53 gene family participates in almost all the key procedures of cancer biology, such as programmed cell death, angiogenesis, metabolism and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The mutation or functional defects of the p53 gene family are detected in most of the solid malignant tumors, and the restoration of the p53 gene by adenovirus-mediated gene therapy becomes a promising treatment for cancer patients now. AREAS COVERED: In the present review, the potential therapeutic effects of recombinant adenovirus p53 rAd-p53 ( Gendicine ™) were reviewed to explore the biological mechanism underlying the adenovirus-mediated p53 gene therapy. Then, the key points of the drug administration were discussed, including the routes of administration, dosage calculation and treatment cycles, based on findings of the preclinical and clinical trials in order to establish a standard treatment for the p53 gene therapy. EXPERT OPINION: As an important part of the combined therapy for the cancer patients, the adenovirus-mediated p53 gene therapy was blossomed to be a promising treatment strategy. A new evaluation criteria and guideline for the gene therapy is urgently needed for the further clinical practice.
25765771	A novel cell-permeable RDP-p53 fusion protein for specific inhibition on the growth of cancerous neural cells.	Wu J, Zhang E, Fu A.	OBJECTIVE: There is 25-35% mutation rate of p53 in cancerous neural cells and this rate reaches 70-76% in glioma cell line. Complement of wild-type p53 has become a potential strategy for protein therapy of cancerous neural cells. Here we investigated the feasibility of a novel RDP-p53 fusion protein for anti-proliferation of cancerous neural cell and the possible mechanism, which would provide an effective approach for targeted delivery of p53 protein to treat cancerous neural cells. METHODS: The RDP-p53 fusion proteins are expressed in Escherichia coli, and they are labeled with FITC and rhodamine B by chemical modification. The fluorescence-labeled proteins are added to human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG-2) and human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) in order to investigate the possibility of RDP enhancing the cell uptake efficiency into neural cells as a cell-permeable carrier. The inhibitory effect of RDP-p53 on SH-SY5Y and human glioma cells (U251) was evaluated by MTT assay. Moreover, the anti-proliferation mechanism of RDP-p53 was determined by Apoptosis and Necrosis Assay Kit and flow cytometric analysis. RESULTS: The results showed that RDP-p53 could enter SH-SY5Y cells with high efficiency and selectively inhibit the growth of cancerous neural cells, including SH-SY5Y and U251. Also, cell apoptosis pathway and cell-cycle arrest at the G2/M phase were associated with the inhibition mechanism of RDP-p53 according to the data of flow cytometric analysis. CONCLUSIONS: RDP-p53 could be a novel antitumor candidate for targeting treatment of cancerous neural cells.
26433055	PDCD5 functions as a regulator of p53 dynamics in the DNA damage response.	Zhuge C, Sun X, Chen Y, Lei J.	The tumor suppressor p53 plays a central role in cell fate decisions after DNA damage. Programmed Cell Death 5 (PDCD5) is known to interact with the p53 pathway to promote cell apoptosis. Recombinant human PDCD5 can significantly sensitize different cancers to chemotherapies. In the present paper, we construct a computational model that includes PDCD5 interactions in the p53 signaling network and study the effects of PDCD5 on p53-mediated cell fate decisions during the DNA damage response. Our results revealed that PDCD5 functions as a co-activator of p53 and regulates p53-dependent cell fate decisions via the mediation of p53 dynamics. The effects of PDCD5 are dose-dependent, such that p53 activity exhibit sustained low level, pulsed oscillations, or sustained high level dynamics depending on the PDCD5 level following DNA damage. Moreover, PDCD5 regulates caspase-3 activation via two mechanisms during the two phases of sustained and pulsed p53 dynamics. This study provides insights regarding how PDCD5 functions as a regulator of the p53 pathway and might be helpful for increasing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which PDCD5 can be used to treat cancers.
26481026	[Punish or cherish: p53, metabolism and tumor suppression].	Albagli O.	The p53 gene is essential for tumor suppression, but how it does so remains unclear. Upon genotoxic or oncogenic stresses, increased p53 activity induces transient cell cycle arrest, senescence or apoptosis, the three cornerstones of the so-called triumvirate. Accordingly, it has long been thought that p53 suppresses tumorigenesis by somehow counteracting cell proliferation or survival. However, several recently described genetically modified mice indicate that p53 can suppress tumorigenesis without triggering these three responses. Rather, as an important mechanism for tumor suppression, these mutant mice point to the ability of p53 to prevent the Warburg effect, that is to dampen glycolysis and foster mitochondrial respiration. Interestingly, these metabolic functions of p53 rely, in part, on its "unstressed" (basal) expression, a feature shared by its mechanistically linked anti-oxydant function. Together, these "conservative" activities of p53 may prevent tumor initiation by promoting and maintaining a normal oxidative metabolism and hence underly the "daily" tumor suppression by p53 in most cells. Conversely, destructive activities elicited by high p53 levels and leading to senescence or apoptosis provide a shield against partially or overtly transformed cells. This last situation, although relatively infrequent throughout life, is usual in experimental settings, which could explain the disproportionally high number of data implicating the triumvirate in tumor suppression by p53.
26018553	Nuclear Localization Signal and p53 Binding Site in MAP/ERK Kinase Kinase 1 (MEKK1).	Chipps E, Protzman A, Muhi MZ, Ando S, Calvet JP, Islam MR.	Previously, we showed that Mekk1 translocates to the nucleus, interacts with tumor suppressor protein p53, and co-represses PKD1 transcription via an atypical p53 binding site on the minimal PKD1 promoter (JBC 285:38,818-38,831, 2010). In this study, we report the mechanisms of Mekk1 nuclear transport and p53 binding. Using GFP-linked constitutively active-Mekk1 (CA-Mekk1) and a deletion strategy, we identified a nuclear localization signal (HRDVK) located at amino acid (aa) residues 1,349-1,353 in the C-terminal Mekk1 catalytic domain. Deletion of this sequence in CA-Mekk1 and full-length Mekk1 significantly reduced their nuclear translocation in both HEK293T and COS-1 cells. Using co-immunoprecipitation, we identified an adjacent sequence (GANLID, aa 1,354-1,360) in Mekk1 responsible for p53 binding. Deletion of this sequence markedly reduced the interaction of Mekk1 with p53. Mekk1 does not appear to affect phosphorylation of Ser15, located in the Mdm2 interaction site, or other Ser residues in p53. However, Mekk1 mediates p53 protein stability in the presence of Mdm2 and reduces p53 ubiquitination, suggesting an interference with Mdm2-mediated degradation of p53 by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

26512780	Anti-cancer efficacy of SREBP inhibitor, alone or in combination with docetaxel, in prostate cancer harboring p53 mutations.	Li X, Wu JB, Chung LW, Huang WC.	Mutant p53 proteins (mutant p53s) have oncogenic gain-of-function properties correlated with tumor grade, castration resistance, and prostate cancer (PCa) tumor recurrence. Docetaxel is a standard first-line treatment for metastatic castration-resistant PCa (mCRPC) after the failure of hormone therapy. However, most mCRPC patients who receive docetaxel experience only transient benefits and rapidly develop incurable drug resistance, which is closely correlated with the p53 mutation status. Mutant p53s were recently reported to regulate the metabolic pathways via sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). Therefore, targeting the SREBP metabolic pathways with docetaxel as a combination therapy may offer a potential strategy to improve anti-tumor efficacy and delay cellular drug resistance in mCRPC harboring mutant p53s. Our previous data showed that fatostatin, a new SREBP inhibitor, inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in androgen receptor (AR)-positive PCa cell lines and xenograft mouse models. In this study, we demonstrated that mutant p53s activate the SREBP-mediated metabolic pathways in metastatic AR-negative PCa cells carrying mutant p53s. By blocking the SREBP pathways, fatostatin inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in metastatic AR-negative PCa cells harboring mutant p53s. Furthermore, the combination of fatostatin and docetaxel resulted in greater proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction compared with single agent treatment in PCa cells in vitro and in vivo, especially those with mutant p53s. These data suggest for the first time that fatostatin alone or in combination with docetaxel could be exploited as a novel and promising therapy for metastatic PCa harboring p53 mutations.
26460617	STIP is a critical nuclear scaffolding protein linking USP7 to p53-Mdm2 pathway regulation.	Ye M, Tang Y, Tang S, Liu J, Wu K, Yao S, Sun Y, Zhou L, Deng T, Chen Y, Huang C, Tan W.	The ubiquitin-specific protease USP7 stabilizes both Mdm2 and p53 by removing ubiquitins, hence playing an important enzymatic role in the p53-Mdm2 pathway. However, it is poorly understood how USP7 executes its dual-stabilization effect on Mdm2 and p53 in cellular context. Here, we report that STIP is a novel macromolecular scaffold that links USP7 to the p53-Mdm2 pathway. STIP and a fraction of USP7 interact and constitutively colocalize in nucleoplasma. Overexpression of STIP stabilizes Mdm2 and p53, whereas downregulation of STIP decreases Mdm2 and p53 levels. The effect of STIP on Mdm2 and p53 depends on USP7 function as a deubiquitinating enzyme. Furthermore, we demonstrate that STIP mediates the assembly of two separate ternary protein complexes in vivo as STIP-USP7-Mdm2 and STIP-USP7-p53, which facilitates USP7-mediated stabilization of Mdm2 and p53. Collectively, these results pinpoint a new molecular function of STIP and reveal a novel mechanism whereby USP7 executes its dual-stabilization effect on Mdm2 and p53 via STIP scaffolding.
25495071	Pharmacological reactivation of p53 as a strategy to treat cancer.	Zawacka-Pankau J, Selivanova G.	It has been confirmed through studies using the technique of unbiased sequencing that the TP53 tumour suppressor is the most frequently inactivated gene in cancer. This finding, together with results from earlier studies, provides compelling evidence for the idea that p53 ablation is required for the development and maintenance of tumours. Genetic reconstitution of the function of p53 leads to the suppression of established tumours as shown in mouse models. This strongly supports the notion that p53 reactivation by small molecules could provide an efficient strategy to treat cancer. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the development of small molecules that restore the function of mutant p53 by different mechanisms, including stabilization of its folding by Apr-246, which is currently being tested in a Phase II clinical trial. We discuss several classes of compounds that reactivate wild-type p53, such as Mdm2 inhibitors, which are currently undergoing clinical testing, MdmX inhibitors and molecules targeting factors upstream of Mdm2/X or p53 itself. Finally, we consider the clinical applications of compounds targeting p53 and the p53 pathway.
26252178	Decrease of mitochondrial p53 during late apoptosis is linked to its dephosphorylation on serine 20.	Castrogiovanni C, Vandaudenard M, Waterschoot B, De Backer O, Dumont P.	Following a genotoxic stress, the tumor suppressor p53 translocates to mitochondria to take part in direct induction of apoptosis, via interaction with BCL-2 family members such as BAK and BAX. We determined the kinetics of the mitochondrial translocation of p53 in HCT-116 and PA-1 cells exposed to different genotoxic stresses (doxorubicin, camptothecin, UVB). This analysis revealed an early escalation in the amount of mitochondrial p53, followed by a peak amount and a decrease of mitochondrial p53 at later time points. We show that the serine 20 phosphorylated form of p53 is present at the mitochondria and that the decrease of p53 mitochondrial level during late apoptosis correlates with a decrease of Ser-20 phosphorylation. Moreover, the S20A p53 mutant translocates well to mitochondria after a genotoxic stress but its mitochondrial localization is very low during late apoptosis when compared to wt p53. The S20A mutant also appears to be compromised for interaction with BAK. We propose here that the level of serine 20 phosphorylation is influential on p53 mitochondrial localization during late apoptosis. Additionally, we report the presence of a new ≃45 kDa caspase-cleaved fragment of p53 in the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions of apoptotic cells.
25732051	Trans-splicing repair of mutant p53 suppresses the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo.	He X, Liu F, Yan J, Zhang Y, Yan J, Shang H, Dou Q, Zhao Q, Song Y.	Reactivation of wild-type p53 (wt-p53) function is an attractive therapeutic approach to p53-defective cancers. An ideal p53-based gene therapy should restore wt-p53 production and reduces mutant p53 transcripts simultaneously. In this study, we described an alternative strategy named as trans-splicing that repaired mutant p53 transcripts in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. The plasmids which encoded a pre-trans-splicing molecule (PTM) targeting intron 6 of p53 were constructed and then transfected into HCC cells carrying p53 mutation. Phenotypic changes of HCC cells induced by p53-PTM were analyzed through cell cycle, cell apoptosis and the expression of p53 downstream target genes. Spliceosome mediated RNA trans-splicing (SMaRT) reduced mutant p53 transcripts and produced functional wt-p53 protein after the delivery of p53-PTM plasmids, which resulted in phenotype correction of HCC cells. In tumor xenografts established by p53-mutated HCC cells, adenovirus encoding p53-PTM induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and then blocked the growth of tumors in mice. Collectively, our results demonstrated for the first time that mutant p53 transcripts were functionally corrected in p53-defective HCC cells and xenografts using trans-splicing, which indicated the feasibility of using trans-splicing to repair p53 mutation in p53-defective cancers.
25885474	The p53R172H mutant does not enhance hepatocellular carcinoma development and progression.	Ahronian LG, Driscoll DR, Klimstra DS, Lewis BC.	Hepatocellular carcinoma is a highly deadly malignancy, accounting for approximately 800,000 deaths worldwide every year. Mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene is a common genetic change in HCC, present in 30% of cases. p53R175H (corresponding to p53R172H in mice) is a hotspot for mutation that demonstrates "prometastatic" gain-of-function in other cancer models. Since the frequency of p53 mutation increases with tumor grade in HCC, we hypothesized that p53R172H is a gain-of-function mutation in HCC that contributes to a decrease in tumor-free survival and an increase in metastasis. In an HCC mouse model, we found that p53R172H/flox mice do not have decreased survival, increased tumor incidence, or increased metastasis, relative to p53flox/flox littermates. Analysis of cell lines derived from both genotypes indicated that there are no differences in anchorage-independent growth and cell migration. However, shRNA-mediated knockdown of mutant p53 in p53R172H-expressing HCC cell lines resulted in decreased cell migration and anchorage-independent growth. Thus, although p53 mutant-expressing cells and tumors do not have enhanced properties relative to their p53 null counterparts, p53R172H-expressing HCC cells depend on this mutant for their transformation. p53 mutants have been previously shown to bind and inhibit the p53 family proteins p63 and p73. Interestingly, we find that the levels of p63 and p73 target genes are similar in p53 mutant and p53 null HCC cells. These data suggest that pathways regulated by these p53 family members are similarly impacted by p53R172H in mutant expressing cells, and by alternate mechanisms in p53 null cells, resulting in equivalent phenotypes. Consistent with this, we find that p53 null HCC cell lines display lower levels of the TA isoforms of p63 and p73 and higher levels of ΔNp63. Taken together these data point to the importance of p63 and p73 in constraining HCC progression.
25308264	Detection of p53 protein transcriptional activity by chromatin immunoprecipitation.	Yang-Hartwich Y, Romanoff E, Bingham J, Alvero AB, Mor G.	p53 is a key transcriptional mediator that controls the expression of hundreds of target genes necessary to maintain cellular homeostasis and genome integrity. An important cellular function that is dependent on p53 transcriptional activity is apoptosis or programmed cell death. Indeed, inhibition of p53 transcriptional activity is often observed in cancers as a result of mutations within its DNA-binding domain. In this chapter, we describe the use of chromatin immunoprecipitation and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction to detect p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells and tumor tissues. This technique enables the determination of the ability of p53 to bind to the promoter region of apoptotic genes and to evaluate the transcription-dependent activity of p53-induced apoptosis.
25421682	P53 tumor suppression network in cancer epigenetics.	Mishra A, Brat DJ, Verma M.	The tumor suppressor p53 is one of the most complex and widely studied genes in cancer biology. In spite of the vast on literature the transcriptional regulation of p53, aspects of its especially epigenetic regulation are not completely understood. This chapter presents a concise overview of p53-related epigenetic events involved in oncogenesis and tumor suppression. We limit the scope to epigenetic modifications of the p53 promoter per se as well as its well-established downstream targets. The indirect role of p53 affecting the epigenetic machinery of cancer cells via specific proteins and transcription factors is discussed. Current concepts of p53-related cancer epigenetics offer myriad avenues for cancer therapies. Challenges in the field are also discussed.
25624096	A silica-polymer composite nano system for tumor-targeted imaging and p53 gene therapy of lung cancer.	Wu H, Zhao Y, Mu X, Wu H, Chen L, Liu W, Mu Y, Liu J, Wei X.	In our study, a silica-polymer composite nano system (MB-NSi-p53-CS ternary complexes) composed of methylene blue-encapsulated amine-terminated silica nanoparticles (MB-NSi) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) were successfully developed for tumor-targeted imaging and p53 gene therapy of lung cancer. MB was employed as a NIR probe for in vivo imaging, MB-NSi nanoparticles were served as gene vector, while CS was applied to be a coating and targeting polymer. MB-NSi-p53-CS ternary complexes displayed nanosized diameter, effective p53 condensation ability, efficient p53 protection profile, and superior bovine serum albumin stability in vitro. Experiments on A549 cell line further revealed low cytotoxicity, high p53 transfection, and anticancer efficacy of MB-NSi-p53-CS ternary complexes. In vivo imaging and tumor targetability assays demonstrated that MB-NSi-p53-CS ternary complexes were a preferable system with desirable imaging and tumor-targeting properties.
25363585	Native PAGE to study the interaction between the oncosuppressor p53 and its protein ligands.	Lamberti A, Sgammato R, Desiderio D, Punzo C, Raimo G, Novellino E, Carotenuto A, Masullo M.	In the present study, we investigated a new approach for studying the interaction between p53 and MDM2/X (where MDM is murine double minute protein). The method is based on the different mobility between the interacting domains of the oncosuppressor p53 and its protein ligands MDM2/X on polyacrylamide gels under native conditions. While the two proteins MDM2/X alone were able to enter the gel, the formation of a binary complex between p53 and MDM2/X prevented the gel entry. The novel technique is reliable for determining the different affinity elicited by MDM2 or MDMX toward p53, and can be useful for analyzing the dissociation power exerted by other molecules on the p53-MDM2/X complex.
25524638	p53 loss increases the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells.	He Y, de Castro LF, Shin MH, Dubois W, Yang HH, Jiang S, Mishra PJ, Ren L, Gou H, Lal A, Khanna C, Merlino G, Lee M, Robey PG, Huang J.	The tumor suppressor, p53, plays a critical role in suppressing osteosarcoma. Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs, also known as bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells) have been suggested to give rise to osteosarcomas. However, the role of p53 in BMSCs has not been extensively explored. Here, we report that p53 regulates the lineage choice of mouse BMSCs (mBMSCs). Compared to mBMSCs with wild-type p53, mBMSCs deficient in p53 have enhanced osteogenic differentiation, but with similar adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation. The role of p53 in inhibiting osteogenic lineage differentiation is mainly through the action of Runx2, a master transcription factor required for the osteogenic differentiation of mBMSCs. We find that p53 indirectly represses the expression of Runx2 by activating the microRNA-34 family, which suppresses the translation of Runx2. Since osteosarcoma may derive from BMSCs, we examined whether p53 has a role in the osteogenic differentiation of osteosarcoma cells and found that osteosarcoma cells with p53 deletion have higher levels of Runx2 and faster osteogenic differentiation than those with wild-type p53. A systems biology approach reveals that p53-deficient mBMSCs are more closely related to human osteosarcoma while mBMSCs with wild-type p53 are similar to normal human BMSCs. In summary, our results indicate that p53 activity can influence cell fate specification of mBMSCs, and provide molecular and cellular insights into the observation that p53 loss is associated with increased osteosarcoma incidence.
26231733	Cell death decision by p53 via control of the mitochondrial membrane.	Dashzeveg N, Yoshida K.	The tumor suppressor p53 is mutated in more than half of human cancers. Recent evidence has revealed that p53 not only regulates apoptosis but also regulates necrotic/necroptotic cell death via the mitochondria. The regulation of apoptosis by p53 is tightly connected to the mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and the induction of and interaction with Bcl-2 family members. Interestingly, p53-mediated regulation of necrosis/necroptosis is correlated with mitochondrial permeabilization pore opening via interactions with CypD and Drp1. This review discusses the p53-regulating molecules that induce apoptosis or necrosis/necroptosis via the mitochondria.
25607652	KSHV latent protein LANA2 inhibits sumo2 modification of p53.	Laura MV, de la Cruz-Herrera CF, Ferreirós A, Baz-Martínez M, Lang V, Vidal A, Muñoz-Fontela C, Rodríguez MS, Collado M, Rivas C.	Tumor suppressor p53 plays a crucial antiviral role and targeting of p53 by viral proteins is a common mechanism involved in virus oncogenesis. The activity of p53 is tightly regulated at the post-translational levels through a myriad of modifications. Among them, modification of p53 by SUMO has been associated with the onset of cellular senescence. Kaposi´s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) expresses several proteins targeting p53, including the latent protein LANA2 that regulates polyubiquitylation and phosphorylation of p53. Here we show that LANA2 also inhibits the modification of p53 by SUMO2. Furthermore, we show that the reduction of p53-SUMO2 conjugation by LANA2, as well as the p53-LANA2 interaction, both require the SUMOylation of the viral protein and its interaction with SUMO or SUMOylated proteins in a non-covalent manner. Finally, we show that the control of p53-SUMO2 conjugation by LANA2 correlates with its ability to inhibit SUMO2- and type I interferon-induced senescence. These results highlight the importance of p53 SUMOylation in the control of virus infection and suggest that viral oncoproteins could contribute to viral infection and cell transformation by abrogating p53 SUMOylation.
25911240	The regulation of radiosensitivity by p53 and its acetylation.	Zhang J, Shen L, Sun LQ.	The p53 signaling pathway plays critical roles in determining the radio-sensitivity of normal tissues but is frequently inactivated in cancer. In various cancer cells, p53 has different effects on radio-sensitivity through complex mechanisms. Acetylation of p53 is an important means of post-translational modifications and is indispensable for its activation that is a reversible enzymatic process. Both acetylation and deacetylation of p53 are involved in the fine regulation of cellular responses to DNA damage and genotoxic stress, such as radiation. Targeting the acetylation of p53 may enable the modulation of radio-sensitivity of cancer cells.
25592822	DNA damage stress induces the expression of ribosomal protein S27a gene in a p53-dependent manner.	Nosrati N, Kapoor NR, Kumar V.	The small ribosomal protein RPS27a is known to play a role in the activation of cellular checkpoints via p53 which links ribosome biogenesis to cell cycle progression. Here, we show that RPS27a gene is a direct transcriptional target of p53 and is overexpressed in response to DNA damage. Elevated RPS27a level was associated with increased expression of p53 and its target p21(Waf1) gene. The RPS27a activity was specifically inhibited in the presence of a dominant negative mutant of p53. Down-regulation of ectopically expressed RPS27a by RNA interference blocked the activation of p21(waf1) in response to DNA damage. Thus, RPS27a appears to be a novel stress sensor in the cell which amplifies p53 response to arrest cell cycle.
26162908	p53 suppresses hyper-recombination by modulating BRCA1 function.	Dong C, Zhang F, Luo Y, Wang H, Zhao X, Guo G, Powell SN, Feng Z.	Both p53 and BRCA1 are tumor suppressors and are involved in a number of cellular processes including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, transcriptional regulation, and DNA damage repair. Some studies have suggested that the association of BRCA1 and p53 is required for transcriptional regulation of genes involved in cell replication and DNA repair pathways. However, the relationship between the two proteins in molecular mechanisms of DNA repair is still not clear. Therefore, we sought to determine whether there is a functional link between p53 and BRCA1 in DNA repair. Firstly, using a plasmid recombination substrate, pDR-GFP, integrated into the genome of breast cancer cell line MCF7, we have demonstrated that p53 suppressed Rad51-mediated hyper-recombinational repair by two independent cell models of HPV-E6 induced p53 inactivation and p53 knockdown assay. Our study further indicated that p53 mediated homologous recombination (HR) through inhibiting BRCA1 over-function via mechanism of transcription regulation in response to DNA repair. Since it was found p53 and BRCA1 existed in a protein complex, indicating both proteins may be associated at post-transcriptional level. Moreover, defective p53-induced hyper-recombination was associated with cell radioresistance and chromosomal stability, strongly supporting the involvement of p53 in the inhibition of hyper-recombination, which led to genetic stability and cellular function in response to DNA damage. In addition, it was found that p53 loss rescued BRCA1 deficiency via recovering HR and chromosomal stability, suggesting that p53 is also involved in the HR-inhibition independently of BRCA1. Thus, our data indicated that p53 was involved in inhibiting recombination by both BRCA1-dependent and -independent mechanisms, and there is a functional link between p53-suppression and BRCA1-promotion in regulation of HR activity at transcription level and possible post-transcription level.
26595461	CRISPR-Cas9-based target validation for p53-reactivating model compounds.	Wanzel M, Vischedyk JB, Gittler MP, Gremke N, Seiz JR, Hefter M, Noack M, Savai R, Mernberger M, Charles JP, Schneikert J, Bretz AC, Nist A, Stiewe T.	Inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor by Mdm2 is one of the most frequent events in cancer, so compounds targeting the p53-Mdm2 interaction are promising for cancer therapy. Mechanisms conferring resistance to p53-reactivating compounds are largely unknown. Here we show using CRISPR-Cas9-based target validation in lung and colorectal cancer that the activity of nutlin, which blocks the p53-binding pocket of Mdm2, strictly depends on functional p53. In contrast, sensitivity to the drug RITA, which binds the Mdm2-interacting N terminus of p53, correlates with induction of DNA damage. Cells with primary or acquired RITA resistance display cross-resistance to DNA crosslinking compounds such as cisplatin and show increased DNA cross-link repair. Inhibition of FancD2 by RNA interference or pharmacological mTOR inhibitors restores RITA sensitivity. The therapeutic response to p53-reactivating compounds is therefore limited by compound-specific resistance mechanisms that can be resolved by CRISPR-Cas9-based target validation and should be considered when allocating patients to p53-reactivating treatments.
26425661	PRMT5-dependent p53 escape in tumorigenesis.	Li Y, Diehl JA.	Extensive studies have characterized mutational disruption of p53 signaling in human cancers. However, the mechanism for bypass of p53 function in tumors retaining wild-type p53 has remained ambiguous. Recent studies suggest that PRMT5, which is frequently elevated in human cancers, cooperates with oncogenic cyclin D1 and leaves marks on p53 by way of arginine methylation, promoting the bypass of wild-type p53, and in doing so, evade apoptosis.
25576916	Functional repair of p53 mutation in colorectal cancer cells using trans-splicing.	He X, Liao J, Liu F, Yan J, Yan J, Shang H, Dou Q, Chang Y, Lin J, Song Y.	Mutation in the p53 gene is arguably the most frequent type of gene-specific alterations in human cancers. Current p53-based gene therapy contains the administration of wt-p53 or the suppression of mutant p53 expression in p53-defective cancer cells. . We hypothesized that trans-splicing could be exploited as a tool for the correction of mutant p53 transcripts in p53-mutated human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. In this study, the plasmids encoding p53 pre-trans-splicing molecules (PTM) were transfected into human CRC cells carrying p53 mutation. The plasmids carrying p53-PTM repaired mutant p53 transcripts in p53-mutated CRC cells, which resulted in a reduction in mutant p53 transcripts and an induction of wt-p53 simultaneously. Intratumoral administration of adenovirus vectors carrying p53 trans-splicing cassettes suppressed the growth of tumor xenografts. Repair of mutant p53 transcripts by trans-splicing induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in p53-defective colorectal cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated for the first time that trans-splicing was exploited as a strategy for the repair of mutant p53 transcripts, which revealed that trans-splicing would be developed as a new therapeutic approach for human colorectal cancers carrying p53 mutation.
25624484	p53 at the endoplasmic reticulum regulates apoptosis in a Ca2+-dependent manner.	Giorgi C, Bonora M, Sorrentino G, Missiroli S, Poletti F, Suski JM, Galindo Ramirez F, Rizzuto R, Di Virgilio F, Zito E, Pandolfi PP, Wieckowski MR, Mammano F, Del Sal G, Pinton P.	The tumor suppressor p53 is a key protein in preventing cell transformation and tumor progression. Activated by a variety of stimuli, p53 regulates cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Along with its well-documented transcriptional control over cell-death programs within the nucleus, p53 exerts crucial although still poorly understood functions in the cytoplasm, directly modulating the apoptotic response at the mitochondrial level. Calcium (Ca(2+)) transfer between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria represents a critical signal in the induction of apoptosis. However, the mechanism controlling this flux in response to stress stimuli remains largely unknown. Here we show that, in the cytoplasm, WT p53 localizes at the ER and at specialized contact domains between the ER and mitochondria (mitochondria-associated membranes). We demonstrate that, upon stress stimuli, WT p53 accumulates at these sites and modulates Ca(2+) homeostasis. Mechanistically, upon activation, WT p53 directly binds to the sarco/ER Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) pump at the ER, changing its oxidative state and thus leading to an increased Ca(2+) load, followed by an enhanced transfer to mitochondria. The consequent mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload causes in turn alterations in the morphology of this organelle and induction of apoptosis. Pharmacological inactivation of WT p53 or naturally occurring p53 missense mutants inhibits SERCA pump activity at the ER, leading to a reduction of the Ca(2+) signaling from the ER to mitochondria. These findings define a critical nonnuclear function of p53 in regulating Ca(2+) signal-dependent apoptosis.
25814188	A tryptophanol-derived oxazolopiperidone lactam is cytotoxic against tumors via inhibition of p53 interaction with murine double minute proteins.	Soares J, Raimundo L, Pereira NA, dos Santos DJ, Pérez M, Queiroz G, Leão M, Santos MM, Saraiva L.	Inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein by interaction with murine double minute (MDM) proteins, MDM2 and MDMX, is a common event in human tumors expressing wild-type p53. In these tumors, the simultaneous inhibition of these interactions with MDMs, for a full p53 reactivation, represents a promising anticancer strategy. Herein, we report the identification of a dual inhibitor of the p53 interaction with MDM2 and MDMX, the (S)-tryptophanol derivative OXAZ-1, from the screening of a small library of enantiopure tryptophanol-derived oxazolopiperidone lactams, using a yeast-based assay. With human colon adenocarcinoma HCT116 cell lines expressing wild-type p53 (HCT116 p53(+/+)) and its p53-null isogenic derivative (HCT116 p53(-/-)), it was shown that OXAZ-1 induced a p53-dependent tumor growth-inhibitory effect. In fact, OXAZ-1 induced p53 stabilization, up-regulated p53 transcription targets, such as MDM2, MDMX, p21, Puma and Bax, and led to PARP cleavage, in p53(+/+), but not in p53(-/-), HCT116 cells. In addition, similar tumor cytotoxic effects were observed for OXAZ-1 against MDMX-overexpressing breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 tumor cells, commonly described as highly resistant to MDM2-only inhibitors. In HCT116 p53(+/+) cells, the disruption of the p53 interaction with MDMs by OXAZ-1 was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. It was also shown that OXAZ-1 potently triggered a p53-dependent mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, characterized by reactive oxygen species generation, mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation, Bax translocation to mitochondria, and cytochrome c release, and exhibited a p53-dependent synergistic effect with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. Collectively, in this work, a novel selective activator of the p53 pathway is reported with promising antitumor properties to be explored either alone or combined with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. Moreover, OXAZ-1 may represent a promising starting scaffold to search for new dual inhibitors of the p53-MDMs interaction.
26379189	BAC transgenic mice provide evidence that p53 expression is highly regulated in vivo.	Chen L, Zhang GX, Zhou Y, Zhang CX, Xie YY, Xiang C, He XY, Zhang Q, Liu G.	p53 is an important tumor suppressor and stress response mediator. Proper control of p53 level and activity is tightly associated with its function. Posttranslational modifications and the interactions with Mdm2 and Mdm4 are major mechanisms controlling p53 activity and stability. As p53 protein is short-lived and hardly detectable in unstressed situations, less is known on its basal level expression and the corresponding controlling mechanisms in vivo. In addition, it also remains obscure how p53 expression might contribute to its functional regulation. In this study, we established bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic E.coli β-galactosidase Z gene reporter mice to monitor p53 expression in mouse tissues and identify important regulatory elements critical for the expression in vivo. We revealed preferentially high level of p53 reporter expressions in the proliferating, but not the differentiated compartments of the majority of tissues during development and tissue homeostasis. In addition, tumors as well as regenerating tissues in the p53 reporter mice also expressed high level of β-gal. Furthermore, both the enhancer box sequence (CANNTG) in the p53 promoter and the 3' terminal untranslated region element were critical in mediating the high-level expression of the reporter. We also provided evidence that cellular myelocytomatosis oncogene was a critical player regulating p53 mRNA expression in proliferating cells and tissues. Finally, we found robust p53 activation preferentially in the proliferating compartment of mouse tissues upon DNA damage and the proliferating cells exhibited an enhanced p53 response as compared with cells in a quiescent state. Together, these results suggested a highly regulated expression pattern of p53 in the proliferating compartment controlled by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms, and such regulated p53 expression may impose functional significance upon stress by setting up a precautionary mode in defense of cellular transformation and tumorigenesis.
25801700	RETRA exerts anticancer activity in Ewing's sarcoma cells independent of their TP53 status.	Sonnemann J, Grauel D, Blümel L, Hentschel J, Marx C, Blumrich A, Focke K, Becker S, Wittig S, Schinkel S, Krämer OH, Beck JF.	Mutant p53 can exert oncogenic activity by inhibitory interaction with p73. The small-molecule RETRA has been described to disrupt this interaction and to suppress carcinoma cells (Kravchenko et al., 2008). RETRA's anticancer activity was restricted to tumour cells bearing mutant p53; it was not active in p53 negative and in p53 wild-type cells. Here, we explored the responsiveness of Ewing's sarcoma (ES) cells with mutant p53 to RETRA. For comparison, we also tested RETRA in p53 null and in p53 wild-type ES cells. We found RETRA to be effective in the three mutant p53 ES cell lines investigated. Strikingly, however, RETRA was similarly effective in the p53-deficient and in the two p53 wild-type ES cell lines examined. RETRA elicited apoptosis, as assessed by flow cytometric analyses of mitochondrial depolarisation and DNA fragmentation, caspase 3/7 activity assay and PARP-1 cleavage immunodetection, and G2/M cell cycle arrest completely independent of the cellular TP53 status. In contrast, various p53-deficient and -proficient carcinoma, osteosarcoma and leukaemia cells were unresponsive to RETRA. RETRA also induced gene expression of p53 target genes PUMA and p21 in ES cells irrespective of their TP53 status. These in vitro findings provide a rationale for an in vivo exploration of RETRA's potential as an effective therapeutic approach for patients with ES.
26003295	Isolation, characterization and functional analysis of full length p53 cDNA from Bubalus bubalis.	Singh M, Aggarwal S, Mohanty AK, Mukhopadhyay T.	p53 plays a pivotal role in maintaining the genomic integrity of the cell and has an important role in cellular transformation. We isolated and cloned a full length p53 cDNA (Bp53) from water buffalo in expression vectors designed to generate tagged proteins with FLAG or GFP. Bp53 was found to be 1161 nucleotide long and codes for 386 amino acid residues with 79% homology with human p53 containing 393 amino acids. Although Bp53 has some inherent differences in amino acid composition in different functional domains as compared to human p53 but the total electrostatic charge of amino acids has been maintained. Bp53 cDNA was transiently transfected in a p53 null human NSCLC cell line and as expected, it was predominantly localized in the nucleus. Besides, Bp53 effectively transactivates a number of target genes similar to human p53 and exerts most of its anti-tumorigenic potential in culture as observed in clonogenic and cell viability assays. Like human p53 mutants, core domain mutant version of Bp53 was found to be mis-localized to cytoplasm with diminished tumor suppressor activity. However, Bp53 appeared to be more sensitive to mdm2 mediated degradation and as a result, this protein was less stable as compared to human p53. For the first time we have characterized a functionally efficient wild-type p53 from buffalo having lower stability than human p53 and thus, buffalo p53 could be used as a model system for further insight to the molecular basis of wild-type p53 instability.
25338966	A novel pyrido-thieno-pyrimidine derivative activates p53 through induction of phosphorylation and acetylation in colorectal cancer cells.	Kang MA, Kim MS, Kim JY, Shin YJ, Song JY, Jeong JH.	The tumor suppressor p53 plays a key role in regulation of the cell cycle, apoptosis and senescence in response to various stresses. We screened a library of 7920 chemical compounds for the p53 activator and identified N-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-2,3-dimethyl-4-oxo-4H-pyrido[1,2-a]thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-9-carboxamide (PTP), which significantly increased p53-mediated reporter activity in colorectal cancer cells. PTP was found to induce p53 protein and activated transcription of downstream genes, such as p21 and PUMA, in HCT116 cells, leading to growth delay, G1-phase cell cycle arrest, cell senescence and cell death. Proximity ligation assay revealed that PTP weakened the interaction between p53 and murine double minute 2 (MDM2) in situ, thereby inhibiting MDM2-mediated p53 degradation. Although DNA damage has been known to promote phosphorylation of p53 and MDM2, thereby preventing their interaction and stabilizing p53, PTP did not cause DNA damage or activate any DNA damage response signaling. Instead, phosphorylation of p53 was mediated by Erk1/2 MAP kinase. In addition, PTP induced acetylation of p53 at Lys382 in a p300-dependent manner, but sirtuin (SIRT)1 and histone deacetylase (HDAC)1, a well-known p53-regulating deacetylase, were not involved. In the present study, the novel anticancer agent PTP was shown to cause the accumulation of p53 by inducing multiple post-translational modifications, as well as cell cycle arrest, senescence and cell death.
26436494	Effect of p53 gene polymorphism on functions of prostate cancer cells.	Chi N, Yun ZZ, Tan ZH, Li XZ, Chen BT, Liu J, Xu LB, Ma KW, Li SX, Liu JF, Liu CX.	Prostate cancer cells were transfected with plasmids [empty plasmids, wild-type pcDNA3.1-p53 (V/V), mutant type pcDNA3.1- p53 (G/G)] to analyze the effect of p53 gene polymorphisms on the proliferation, cycle, and apoptosis of prostatic cancer cells. Empty plasmids containing wild-type pcDNA3.1-p53 (V/V) and mutant type pcDNA3.1- p53 (G/G) were used to transfect PC3 and LNCaP cells, respectively. Cell proliferation was detected at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h using the MTT method. Cells were collected at 24 and 72 h. The distribution of cell cycles in various groups was detected using flow cytometry (propidium iodide staining method) and the apoptosis rate was detected using annexin V + propidium iodide double staining. Compared with the control group, wild-type pcDNA3.1-p53 (V/V) and mutant type pcDNA3.1-p53 (G/G) showed a significant inhibitory effect on cell proliferation (P < 0.05); the inhibitory effect of the mutant type was stronger than that of the wild-type. There was no significant difference between PC3 cells and LNCaP cells. After transfection with wild-type pcDNA3.1-p53 (V/V) and mutant type pcDNA3.1-p53 (G/G), PC3 and LNCaP cells were arrested in the G0/G1 stage. Transfection with pcDNA3.1-p53 (G/G) showed a more significant effect than transfection with pcDNA3.1-p53 (V/V). Both the wild-type pcDNA3.1-p53 (V/V) and mutant-type pcDNA3.1-p53 (G/G) led to an increased apoptosis rate of PC3 and LNCaP cells. The p53 gene polymorphism affects the proliferation, apoptosis, and cycle of prostate cancer cells and may serve as a reliable index for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.
25971364	p53-dependent non-coding RNA networks in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	Blume CJ, Hotz-Wagenblatt A, Hüllein J, Sellner L, Jethwa A, Stolz T, Slabicki M, Lee K, Sharathchandra A, Benner A, Dietrich S, Oakes CC, Dreger P, Te Raa D, Kater AP, Jauch A, Merkel O, Oren M, Hielscher T, Zenz T.	Mutations of the tumor suppressor p53 lead to chemotherapy resistance and a dismal prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Whereas p53 targets are used to identify patient subgroups with impaired p53 function, a comprehensive assessment of non-coding RNA targets of p53 in CLL is missing. We exploited the impaired transcriptional activity of mutant p53 to map out p53 targets in CLL by small RNA sequencing. We describe the landscape of p53-dependent microRNA/non-coding RNA induced in response to DNA damage in CLL. Besides the key p53 target miR-34a, we identify a set of p53-dependent microRNAs (miRNAs; miR-182-5p, miR-7-5p and miR-320c/d). In addition to miRNAs, the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) and long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) are induced in response to DNA damage in the presence of functional p53 but not in CLL with p53 mutation. Induction of NEAT1 and lincRNA-p21 are closely correlated to the induction of cell death after DNA damage. We used isogenic lymphoma cell line models to prove p53 dependence of NEAT1 and lincRNA-p21. The current work describes the p53-dependent miRNome and identifies lncRNAs NEAT1 and lincRNA-p21 as novel elements of the p53-dependent DNA damage response machinery in CLL and lymphoma.
26183023	Transcriptional activation of APAF1 by KAISO (ZBTB33) and p53 is attenuated by RelA/p65.	Koh DI, An H, Kim MY, Jeon BN, Choi SH, Hur SS, Hur MW.	KAISO, a member of the POK protein family, is induced by DNA-damaging agents to enhance apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. Previously, we found that p53 interacts with KAISO, and acetylation of p53 lysine residues by p300 is modulated by KAISO. APAF1, the core molecule of the apoptosome, is transcriptionally activated by KAISO only in cells expressing p53, which binds to APAF1 promoter p53-response elements (p53REs). APAF1 transcriptional upregulation is further enhanced by KAISO augmentation of p53 binding to the APAF1 promoter distal p53RE#1 (bp, -765 to -739). Interestingly, a NF-κB response element, located close to the p53RE#1, mediates APAF1 transcriptional repression by affecting interaction between KAISO and p53. Ectopic RelA/p65 expression led to depletion of nuclear KAISO, with KAISO being mainly detected in the cytoplasm. RelA/p65 cytoplasmic sequestration of KAISO prevents its nuclear interaction with p53, decreasing APAF1 transcriptional activation by a p53-KAISO-p300 complex in cells exposed to genotoxic stresses. While KAISO enhances p53-dependent apoptosis by increasing APAF1 gene expression, RelA/p65 decreases apoptosis by blocking interaction between KAISO and p53. These findings have relevance to the phenomenon of cancer cells' diminished apoptotic capacity and the onset of chemotherapy resistance.
25584963	A spatiotemporal characterization of the effect of p53 phosphorylation on its interaction with MDM2.	ElSawy KM, Sim A, Lane DP, Verma CS, Caves LS.	The interaction of p53 and MDM2 is modulated by the phosphorylation of p53. This mechanism is key to activating p53, yet its molecular determinants are not fully understood. To study the spatiotemporal characteristics of this molecular process we carried out Brownian dynamics simulations of the interactions of the MDM2 protein with a p53 peptide in its wild type state and when phosphorylated at Thr18 (pThr18) and Ser20 (pSer20). We found that p53 phosphorylation results in concerted changes in the topology of the interaction landscape in the diffusively bound encounter complex domain. These changes hinder phosphorylated p53 peptides from binding to MDM2 well before reaching the binding site. The underlying mechanism appears to involve shift of the peptide away from the vicinity of the MDM2 protein, peptide reorientation, and reduction in peptide residence time relative to wild-type p53 peptide. pThr18 and pSr20 p53 peptides experience reduction in residence times by factors of 13.6 and 37.5 respectively relative to the wild-type p53 peptide, indicating a greater role for Ser20 phosphorylation in abrogating p53 MDM2 interactions. These detailed insights into the effect of phosphorylation on molecular interactions are not available from conventional experimental and theoretical approaches and open up new avenues that incorporate molecular interaction dynamics, for stabilizing p53 against MDM2, which is a major focus of anticancer drug lead development.
25823025	Oncogenic c-Myc-induced lymphomagenesis is inhibited non-redundantly by the p19Arf-Mdm2-p53 and RP-Mdm2-p53 pathways.	Meng X, Carlson NR, Dong J, Zhang Y.	The multifaceted oncogene c-Myc plays important roles in the development and progression of human cancer. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that the p19Arf-Mdm2-p53 and the ribosomal protein (RP)-Mdm2-p53 pathways are both essential in preventing oncogenic c-Myc-induced tumorigenesis. Disruption of each pathway individually by p19Arf deletion or by Mdm2(C305F) mutation, which disrupts RP-Mdm2 binding, accelerates Eμ-myc transgene-induced pre-B/B-cell lymphoma in mice at seemingly similar paces with median survival around 10 and 11 weeks, respectively, compared to 20 weeks for Eμ-myc transgenic mice. Because p19Arf can inhibit ribosomal biogenesis through its interaction with nucleophosmin (NPM/B23), RNA helicase DDX5 and RNA polymerase I transcription termination factor (TTF-I), it has been speculated that the p19Arf-Mdm2-p53 and the RP-Mdm2-p53 pathways might be a single p19Arf-RP-Mdm2-p53 pathway, in which p19Arf activates p53 by inhibiting RP biosynthesis; thus, p19Arf deletion or Mdm2(C305F) mutation would result in similar consequences. Here, we generated mice with concurrent p19Arf deletion and Mdm2(C305F) mutation and investigated the compound mice for tumorigenesis in the absence and the presence of oncogenic c-Myc overexpression. In the absence of Eμ-myc transgene, the Mdm2(C305F) mutation did not elicit spontaneous tumors in mice, nor did it accelerate spontaneous tumors in mice with p19Arf deletion. In the presence of Eμ-myc transgene, however, Mdm2(C305F) mutation significantly accelerated p19Arf deletion-induced lymphomagenesis and promoted rapid metastasis. We found that when p19Arf-Mdm2-p53 and RP-Mdm2-p53 pathways are independently disrupted, oncogenic c-Myc-induced p53 stabilization and activation is only partially attenuated. When both pathways are concurrently disrupted, however, c-Myc-induced p53 stabilization and activation are essentially obliterated. Thus, the p19Arf-Mdm2-p53 and the RP-Mdm2-p53 are non-redundant pathways possessing similar capabilities to activate p53 upon c-Myc overexpression.
26391949	Deregulation of Internal Ribosome Entry Site-Mediated p53 Translation in Cancer Cells with Defective p53 Response to DNA Damage.	Halaby MJ, Harris BR, Miskimins WK, Cleary MP, Yang DQ.	Synthesis of the p53 tumor suppressor and its subsequent activation following DNA damage are critical for its protection against tumorigenesis. We previously discovered an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) at the 5' untranslated region of the p53 mRNA. However, the connection between IRES-mediated p53 translation and p53's tumor suppressive function is unknown. In this study, we identified two p53 IRES trans-acting factors, translational control protein 80 (TCP80), and RNA helicase A (RHA), which positively regulate p53 IRES activity. Overexpression of TCP80 and RHA also leads to increased expression and synthesis of p53. Furthermore, we discovered two breast cancer cell lines that retain wild-type p53 but exhibit defective p53 induction and synthesis following DNA damage. The levels of TCP80 and RHA are extremely low in both cell lines, and expression of both proteins is required to significantly increase the p53 IRES activity in these cells. Moreover, we found cancer cells transfected with a shRNA against TCP80 not only exhibit decreased expression of TCP80 and RHA but also display defective p53 induction and diminished ability to induce senescence following DNA damage. Therefore, our findings reveal a novel mechanism of p53 inactivation that links deregulation of IRES-mediated p53 translation with tumorigenesis.
26255629	Mutant p53 accumulates in cycling and proliferating cells in the normal tissues of p53 R172H mutant mice.	Goh AM, Xue Y, Leushacke M, Li L, Wong JS, Chiam PC, Rahmat SA, Mann MB, Mann KM, Barker N, Lozano G, Terzian T, Lane DP.	The tumour suppressor p53 is regulated primarily at the protein level. In normal tissues its levels are maintained at a very low level by the action of specific E3 ligases and the ubiquitin proteosome pathway. The mutant p53 protein contributes to transformation, metastasis and drug resistance. High levels of mutant p53 can be found in tumours and the accumulation of mutant p53 has previously been reported in pathologically normal cells in human skin. We show for the first time that similarly elevated levels of mutant p53 can be detected in apparently normal cells in a mutant p53 knock-in mouse model. In fact, in the small intestine, mutant p53 spontaneously accumulates in a manner dependent on gene dosage and cell type. Mutant p53 protein is regulated similarly to wild type p53, which can accumulate rapidly after induction by ionising radiation or Mdm2 inhibitors, however, the clearance of mutant p53 protein is much slower than wild type p53. The accumulation of the protein in the murine small intestine is limited to the cycling, crypt base columnar cells and proliferative zone and is lost as the cells differentiate and exit the cell cycle. Loss of Mdm2 results in even higher levels of p53 expression but p53 is still restricted to proliferating cells in the small intestine. Therefore, the small intestine of these p53 mutant mice is an experimental system in which we can dissect the molecular pathways leading to p53 accumulation, which has important implications for cancer prevention and therapy.
24374014	Tumor suppressor p53 and its mutants in cancer metabolism.	Liu J, Zhang C, Hu W, Feng Z.	Tumor-suppressor p53 plays a key role in tumor prevention. As a transcription factor, p53 transcriptionally regulates its target genes to initiate different biological processes in response to stress, including apoptosis, cell cycle arrest or senescence, to exert its function in tumor suppression. Recent studies have revealed that metabolic regulation is a novel function of p53. Metabolic changes have been regarded as a hallmark of tumors and a key contributor to tumor development. p53 regulates many different aspects of metabolism, including glycolysis, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid synthesis and oxidation, to maintain the homeostasis of cellular metabolism, which contributes to the role of p53 in tumor suppression. p53 is frequently mutated in human tumors. In addition to loss of tumor suppressive function, tumor-associated mutant p53 proteins often gain new tumorigenic activities, termed gain-of-function of mutant p53. Recent studies have shown that mutant p53 mediates metabolic changes in tumors as a novel gain-of-function to promote tumor development. Here we review the functions and mechanisms of wild-type and mutant p53 in metabolic regulation, and discuss their potential roles in tumorigenesis.
25846496	Clinical and pathological correlations of marrow PUMA and P53 expressions in myelodysplastic syndromes.	Bektas O, Uner A, Buyukasik Y, Uz B, Bozkurt S, Eliacik E, Işik A, Haznedaroglu IC, Goker H, Demiroglu H, Aksu S, Ozcebe OI, Sayinalp N.	p53 is a key regulator of apoptosis. p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) is a critical mediator of p53-dependent and independent apoptosis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship of p53 and PUMA to the prognosis of MDS. Bone marrow biopsies of MDS patients at the time of diagnosis (n = 76) and at the time of transformation (n = 19) were included in the study group. The expression of p53 and PUMA was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. When compared to the control group, both p53 (p < 0.001) and PUMA (p = 0.012) expression levels were significantly higher in MDS group. In MDS group, there was a moderate positive correlation between p53 and PUMA expressions. PUMA expression was not correlated with event free and overall survival. However, overall survival was significantly lower in cases with p53 expression in more than 50% of the cells. There was an increase in PUMA expression in cases that showed transformation as compared to the initial diagnostic bone marrows but was not statistically significant. The correlation that existed between p53 and PUMA was lost in transformed cases. Our results showed that PUMA and p53 expressions are increased in MDS marrows compared to normal marrows. PUMA expression increases further during transformation while the expression of p53 is not significantly altered which suggests that PUMA alterations might be a late event during the evolution of MDS.
26385560	p53 Deletion or Hot-spot Mutations Enhance mTORC1 Activity by Altering Lysosomal Dynamics of TSC2 and Rheb.	Agarwal S, Bell CM, Taylor SM, Moran RG.	The activity of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is frequently enhanced in carcinomas, an effect thought to contribute to the malignant phenotype. Here, it is demonstrated that either deletion or mutation of TP53 in colon or lung carcinoma cells substantially enhances mTORC1 kinase activity by an effect downstream of and independent of AMPK. Mechanistically, it was determined that loss or mutation of p53 decreased expression of TSC2 and Sestrin2 (SESN2). Complementation of p53 null cells with TSC2 or Sestrin2 reduced mTORC1 activity to levels found in p53 wt cells, while their genetic depletion enhanced mTORC1 activity in p53 wt cells. However, the primary causal event in enhanced mTORC1 activity upon loss of p53 appeared to be a diminished distribution of TSC2 to lysosomal membranes containing mTOR. Subsequently, there was increased Rheb in the lysosomal compartment, and a higher mTOR association with Raptor. Transfection of TSC2 into p53 null cells replaced TSC2 and diminished Rheb at the lysosome, recapitulating cells with wt p53. In contrast, transfection of Sestrin2 decreased mTOR in lysosomes, but the lower levels of Sestrin2 in p53 null cells did not change lysosomal mTOR. In summary, loss of the transcriptional activity of p53, either by deletion or by key mutations in the DNA-binding domain, diminishes expression of TSC2 and Sestrin2, thus, shifting membrane-bound TSC2 out of lysosomal membranes, increasing lysosomal Rheb and increasing the kinase activity of mTORC1. IMPLICATIONS: This study establishes that loss of p53 function decreases lysosomal TSC2 and increases lysosomal Rheb resulting in hyperactive mTORC1, findings that are consistent with a more malignant phenotype.
26337205	p53-regulated autophagy is controlled by glycolysis and determines cell fate.	Duan L, Perez RE, Davaadelger B, Dedkova EN, Blatter LA, Maki CG.	The tumor suppressor p53 regulates downstream targets that determine cell fate. Canonical p53 functions include inducing apoptosis, growth arrest, and senescence. Non-canonical p53 functions include its ability to promote or inhibit autophagy and its ability to regulate metabolism. The extent to which autophagy and/or metabolic regulation determines cell fate by p53 is unclear. To address this, we compared cells resistant or sensitive to apoptosis by the p53 activator Nutlin-3a. In resistant cells, glycolysis was maintained upon Nutlin-3a treatment, and activated p53 promoted prosurvival autophagy. In contrast, in apoptosis sensitive cells activated p53 increased superoxide levels and inhibited glycolysis through repression of glycolytic pathway genes. Glycolysis inhibition and increased superoxide inhibited autophagy by repressing ATG genes essential for autophagic vesicle maturation. Inhibiting glycolysis increased superoxide and blocked autophagy in apoptosis-resistant cells, causing p62-dependent caspase-8 activation. Finally, treatment with 2-DG or the autophagy inhibitors chloroquine or bafilomycin A1 sensitized resistant cells to Nutlin-3a-induced apoptosis. Together, these findings reveal novel links between glycolysis and autophagy that determine apoptosis-sensitivity in response to p53. Specifically, the findings indicate 1) that glycolysis plays an essential role in autophagy by limiting superoxide levels and maintaining expression of ATG genes required for autophagic vesicle maturation, 2) that p53 can promote or inhibit autophagy depending on the status of glycolysis, and 3) that inhibiting protective autophagy can expand the breadth of cells susceptible to Nutlin-3a induced apoptosis.
26220208	p53 amplifies Toll-like receptor 5 response in human primary and cancer cells through interaction with multiple signal transduction pathways.	Shatz M, Shats I, Menendez D, Resnick MA.	The p53 tumor suppressor regulates transcription of genes associated with diverse cellular functions including apoptosis, growth arrest, DNA repair and differentiation. Recently, we established that p53 can modulate expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR) innate immunity genes but the degree of cross-talk between p53 and TLR pathways remained unclear. Here, using gene expression profiling we characterize the global effect of p53 on the TLR5-mediated transcription in MCF7 cells. We found that combined activation of p53 and TLR5 pathways synergistically increases expression of over 200 genes, mostly associated with immunity and inflammation. The synergy was observed in several human cancer cells and primary lymphocytes. The p53-dependent amplification of transcriptional response to TLR5 activation required expression of NFκB subunit p65 and was mediated by several molecular mechanisms including increased phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase, PI3K and STAT3 signaling. Additionally, p53 induction increased cytokine expression in response to TNFα, another activator of NFκB and MAP kinase pathways, suggesting a broad interaction between p53 and these signaling pathways. The expression of many synergistically induced genes is elevated in breast cancer patients responsive to chemotherapy. We suggest that p53's capacity to enhance immune response could be exploited to increase antitumor immunity and to improve cancer treatment.
25859976	High content screening biosensor assay to identify disruptors of p53-hDM2 protein-protein interactions.	Hua Y, Strock CJ, Johnston PA.	This chapter describes the implementation of the p53-hDM2 protein-protein interaction (PPI) biosensor (PPIB) HCS assay to identify disruptors of p53-hDM2 PPIs. Recombinant adenovirus expression constructs were generated bearing the individual p53-GFP and hDM2-RFP PPI partners. The N-terminal p53 transactivating domain that contains the binding site for hDM2 is expressed as a GFP fusion protein that is targeted and anchored in the nucleolus of infected cells by a nuclear localization (NLS) sequence. The p53-GFP biosensor is localized to the nucleolus to enhance and facilitate the image acquisition and analysis of the PPIs. The N-terminus of hDM2 encodes the domain for binding to the transactivating domain of p53, and is expressed as a RFP fusion protein that includes both an NLS and a nuclear export sequence (NES). In U-2 OS cells co-infected with both adenovirus constructs, the binding interactions between hDM2 and p53 result in both biosensors becoming co-localized within the nucleolus. Upon disruption of the p53-hDM2 PPIs, the p53-GFP biosensor remains in the nucleolus while the shuttling hDM2-RFP biosensor redistributes into the cytoplasm. p53-hDM2 PPIs are measured by acquiring fluorescent images of cells co-infected with both adenovirus biosensors on an automated HCS imaging platform and using an image analysis algorithm to quantify the relative distribution of the hDM2-RFP shuttling component of the biosensor between the cytoplasm and nuclear regions of compound treated cells.
26053814	P53 stratification reveals the prognostic utility of matrix metalloproteinase-9 protein expression in glioblastoma.	Shastry AH, Thota B, Arimappamagan A, Santosh V.	BACKGROUND: Despite the conventional acceptance of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and MMP-9, as markers of invasion in glioblastoma (GBM), there is no large body of evidence supporting their role as prognostic markers. Since the co-expression of MMPs with p53 was noted to be prognostic in other cancers, we evaluated the protein expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in GBM and explored their prognostic relevance with respect to p53 expression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tumor tissues from a uniformly treated cohort of 132 GBM patients were examined for MMP-2, MMP-9, and p53 protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Survival analyses were performed by Cox-regression and Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis. P53 IHC-based stratification of all GBM cases was performed, and subgroup-specific expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was correlated with survival. RESULTS: MMP-2 and MMP-9 were expressed in p53 positive as well as p53 negative GBM tumors. MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein expressions had no correlation with prognosis. MMP-9 expression, however, emerged as a strong independent predictor of poor survival in p53 positive GBMs on both Cox-regression analysis (P = 0.036) and KM survival analysis (P = 0.008). Further, even on multivariate analysis, MMP-9 remained strongly associated with poor prognosis (P = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: MMP-9 expression strongly associates with poor prognosis in p53 positive GBMs, but the absence of such correlation in p53 negative GBMs, skews the overall relation of this molecule with prognosis. The study highlights that the dual positivity of MMP-9 and p53 is of prognostic relevance in GBM.
25448278	Pifithrin-alpha has a p53-independent cytoprotective effect on docosahexaenoic acid-induced cytotoxicity in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells.	Kanno S, Kurauchi K, Tomizawa A, Yomogida S, Ishikawa M.	Pifithrin-alpha (PFT) is an inhibitor of p53 and is known to protect against a variety of p53-mediated genotoxic agents. In this report, we examined the inhibitory effects of PFT against docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-induced cytotoxicity in the human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line HepG2. PFT significantly abrogated DHA-induced cytotoxicity in wild-type HepG2 cells (normal expression of p53) and after p53-knockdown by siRNA, as well as in Hep3B (p53 null) and Huh7 (p53 mutant) cells. DHA-induced cytotoxicity is mediated by induction of oxidative stress, and PFT inhibited this event, but it does not exert antioxidant effects. PFT significantly suppressed the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol, as well as changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨM) by DHA. Therefore, protection of mitochondria by PFT is crucial for its inhibition of DHA-induced cytotoxicity. Although it has been reported that PFT is able to block p53 function, our data suggest that PFT also has a p53-independent inhibition mechanism. This work provided insights into the mechanisms of PFT action on DHA-induced cytotoxicity in HCC.
26025927	TAT-ODD-p53 enhances the radiosensitivity of hypoxic breast cancer cells by inhibiting Parkin-mediated mitophagy.	Zheng R, Yao Q, Xie G, Du S, Ren C, Wang Y, Yuan Y.	Radiation therapy has an important role in the treatment of breast cancer. Dysfunction p53 and hypoxia are typical biological characteristics of breast cancer that constitute barriers to the efficacy of radiotherapy. Mitophagy plays a protective role in cellular homeostasis under hypoxic conditions, while mitophagy is inhibited by p53 in normal cells. We explored the effects of a p53 fusion protein, TAT-ODD-p53, on the radiosensitivity of hypoxic breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, as well as investigating the related molecular mechanisms. We found that selective accumulation of TAT-ODD-p53 occurred under hypoxic conditions and significantly increased tumor cell radiosensitivity both in vitro and in vivo. Mitophagy had an important role in maintaining hypoxia-induced radioresistance. Mitophagy was inhibited by TAT-ODD-p53 and this inhibition was suppressed by over-expression of Parkin in hypoxic irradiated breast cancer cells. In addition, mitophagy was induced by deletion of p53, with this effect being weakened by Parkin knockdown at a low oxygen tension. By interacting with Parkin, p53 inhibited the translocation of Parkin to the mitochondria, disrupting the protective mitophagy process. These results suggest that TAT-ODD-p53 has a significant and preferential radiosensitizing effect on hypoxic breast cancer cells by inhibition of Parkin-mediated mitophagy.
26454170	Artificial regulation of p53 function by modulating its assembly.	Inobe T, Nozaki M, Nukina N.	The tumor suppressor p53, a 393-amino acid transcription factor with four domains, induces cell cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis in response to diverse stress. Tetramer formation is critical for the function of p53. The tetramerization domain permits the tetramerization of p53, where bundled four DNA-binding domains recognize the specific target DNA sequences and activate hundreds of genes, which lead to the various cell fates. Here we show that tumor suppressive functions of p53 can be regulated by manipulating tetramer formation of an engineered p53, in which tetramerization domain of p53 is replaced with an inducible tetramer forming protein. This result suggests that artificial regulation of p53 activity by the engineered p53 is a useful tool to investigate the tumor suppression mechanism of p53 and to combat cancer.
26252575	Nutlin-3 sensitizes nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells to cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity.	Voon YL, Ahmad M, Wong PF, Husaini R, Ng WT, Leong CO, Lane DP, Khoo AS.	The small-molecule inhibitor of p53-Mdm2 interaction, Nutlin-3, is known to be effective against cancers expressing wild-type (wt) p53. p53 mutations are rare in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), hence targeting disruption of p53-Mdm2 interaction to reactivate p53 may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for NPC. In the present study, the effects of Nutlin-3 alone or in combination with cisplatin, a standard chemotherapeutic agent, were tested on C666-1 cells, an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive NPC cell line bearing wt p53. Treatment with Nutlin-3 activated the p53 pathway and sensitized NPC cells to the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin. The combined treatment also markedly suppressed soft agar colony growth formation and increased apoptosis of NPC cells. The effect of Nutlin-3 on NPC cells was inhibited by knockdown of p53, suggesting that its effect was p53-dependent. Extended treatment with increasing concentrations of Nutlin-3 did not result in emergence of p53 mutations in the C666-1 cells. Collectively, the present study revealed supportive evidence of the effectiveness of combining cisplatin and Nutlin-3 as a potential therapy against NPC.
25439588	Recent advances of p53-MDM2 small molecule inhibitors (2011-present).	Lv PC, Sun J, Zhu HL.	P53 is an important transcriptional factor that plays a pivotal role in different biological process (cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA repair, angiogenesis and cellular metabolism). While p53 binds to the promoter and increases the gene expression of Mdm2, MDM2 protein directly binds to p53 and inhibits its activity. Therefore, inhibitor of p53 and MDM2 has been considered as a potential cancer therapeutic agent due to the critical inhibitory role of MDM2 on p53. Small-molecule inhibitor of p53-MDM2 has been designed to serve as an effective way to treat cancer. Several compounds have moved into different phase of clinical trials based on major advances in the development of small-molecule inhibitors in recent years. Since there are few reviews covering the structure- activity relationship analysis of recent p53-MDM2 inhibitors reported from 2011 to the present time, in this review, attentions are focused on the development of p53-MDM2 inhibitors published from 2011 to the present time.
25946468	Transcriptome profiling identifies p53 as a key player during calreticulin deficiency: Implications in lipid accumulation.	Vig S, Talwar P, Kaur K, Srivastava R, Srivastava AK, Datta M.	Calreticulin (CRT) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident calcium binding protein that is involved in several cellular activities. Transcriptome analyses in CRT knockdown HepG2 cells revealed 253 altered unique genes and subsequent in silico protein-protein interaction network and MCODE clustering identified 34 significant clusters, of which p53 occupied the central hub node in the highest node-rich cluster. Toward validation, we show that CRT knockdown leads to inhibition of p53 protein levels. Both, CRT and p53 siRNA promote hepatic lipid accumulation and this was accompanied by elevated SREBP-1c and FAS levels. p53 was identified to bind at -219 bp on the SREBP-1c promoter and in the presence of CRT siRNA, there was decreased occupancy of p53 on this binding element. This was associated with increased SREBP-1c promoter activity and both, mutation in this binding site or p53 over-expression antagonised the effects of CRT knockdown. We, therefore, identify a negatively regulating p53 binding site on the SREBP-1c promoter that is critical during hepatic lipid accumulation. These results were validated in mouse primary hepatocytes and toward a physiological relevance, we report that while the levels of CRT and p53 are reduced in the fatty livers of diabetic db/db mice, SREBP-1c levels are significantly elevated. Our results suggest that decreased CRT levels might be involved in the development of a fatty liver by preventing p53 occupancy on the SREBP-1c promoter and thereby facilitating SREBP-1c up-regulation and consequently, lipid accumulation.
25896632	p53-mediated autophagic regulation: A prospective strategy for cancer therapy.	Tang J, Di J, Cao H, Bai J, Zheng J.	Autophagy is a major catabolic process that degrades and recycles cytosolic components in autophagosomes, which fuse with lysosomes. This process enables starving cells to sustain their energy requirements and metabolic states, thus facilitating their survival, especially in cancer pathogenesis. The regulation of autophagy is quite intricate. It involves a series of signaling cascades including p53, known as the best-characterized tumor suppressor protein. Recent reports have indicated that p53 plays dual roles in regulating autophagy depending on its subcellular localization. Nuclear p53 facilitates autophagy by transactivating its target genes, whereas cytoplasmic p53 mainly inhibits autophagy through extranuclear, transcription-independent mechanisms. The relationship between autophagy and neoplasia is complicated. It may be intrinsically associated with the functional status of p53, but this is not clearly elucidated. This review focuses on the role of p53 as a master regulator of autophagy. We conclude that the contextual role of autophagy in cancer, which could be switched by p53 status, is expected to be developed into a new anticancer therapeutic approach.
25590240	PCDH10, a novel p53 transcriptional target in regulating cell migration.	Shi D, Murty VV, Gu W.	Cell cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis are commonly regarded as the major tumor suppression mechanisms of p53. However, accumulating evidence indicates that loss of these canonical functions is not sufficient for tumor formation, highlighting the complexity of p53-mediated tumor suppression. PCDH10 belongs to a proto cadherin protein family and is a potential tumor suppressor protein as the dysregulation of PCDH10 gene frequently existed in multiple human tumors. Here, we found that PCDH10 is a transcriptional target of p53 and that the levels of PCDH10 expression can be induced by wild type p53 but not mutant p53 in a number of human cancer cell lines. Moreover, we identified a p53 consensus binding site located in the PCDH10 promoter region that is responsive to p53 regulation. Although upregulation of PCDH10 has no obvious effect on growth arrest or apoptosis in human cells, PCDH10 exhibits inhibitory roles in cancer cell motility and cell migration. These results suggest an important role of p53 in regulating tumor cell migration through activating PCDH10 expression and support the notion that non-canonical activities of p53 may contribute to its tumor suppressor function in vivo.
25574081	P53 mutations in colorectal cancer - molecular pathogenesis and pharmacological reactivation.	Li XL, Zhou J, Chen ZR, Chng WJ.	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies with high prevalence and low 5-year survival. CRC is a heterogeneous disease with a complex, genetic and biochemical background. It is now generally accepted that a few important intracellular signaling pathways, including Wnt/β-catenin signaling, Ras signaling, and p53 signaling are frequently dysregulated in CRC. Patients with mutant p53 gene are often resistant to current therapies, conferring poor prognosis. Tumor suppressor p53 protein is a transcription factor inducing cell cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis under cellular stress. Emerging evidence from laboratories and clinical trials shows that some small molecule inhibitors exert anti-cancer effect via reactivation and restoration of p53 function. In this review, we summarize the p53 function and characterize its mutations in CRC. The involvement of p53 mutations in pathogenesis of CRC and their clinical impacts will be highlighted. Moreover, we also describe the current achievements of using p53 modulators to reactivate this pathway in CRC, which may have great potential as novel anti-cancer therapy.
25806108	New perspective on targeting the tumor suppressor p53 pathway in the tumor microenvironment to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy.	Guo G, Cui Y.	About 50% of human cancers harbor somatic mutations of the tumor suppressor p53 (p53 or Trp53) gene. Many of those mutations result in the inactivation of the p53 pathway and are often associated with the stabilization and accumulation of mutant p53 proteins. Therefore, increased p53 expression in tumors is frequently used as a surrogate marker for p53 mutation and inactivation. Moreover, this elevated p53 expression also makes it an ideal tumor associated antigen (TAA) for cancer vaccines. Recent advances in our understanding of p53 as a crucial transcription factor reveal that p53 is an important sensor of cellular stress under genotoxic, chemotoxic, pathological, and even normal physiological conditions. Experimental and clinical observations by our laboratory and others have demonstrated that p53 also participates in immune regulation as p53 dysfunction skews host immune responses towards pro-inflammation, which further promotes tumor progression. Furthermore, recent studies using a genetic approach revealed that p53-restoration or re-activation led to tumor regression and clearance, which were at least partially caused by the activation of innate antitumor immunity. Since many of the currently used cancer therapeutics, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy, disrupt tumor growth by inducing DNA damage via genotoxic or chemotoxic stress, which activates the p53 pathway in the tumor microenvironment, we postulate that some of those observed therapeutic benefits might also be partially mediated through their immune stimulatory effects. Here, we briefly review our current understanding of the potential cellular and molecular mechanisms by which p53 participates in immune regulation and, subsequently, extend our discussion to the immunostimulatory potential of existing and new approaches of targeting the p53-pathway to alter the immunological landscape of tumors for maximizing immunotherapy outcome.
26572087	Gain-of-function p53 mutant with 21-bp deletion confers susceptibility to multidrug resistance in MCF-7 cells.	Tsou SH, Hou MH, Hsu LC, Chen TM, Chen YH.	The majority of p53 mutations, which are responsible for gain of oncogenic function, are missense mutations in hotspot codons. However, in our previous study, we demonstrated that a deletion spanning codons 127-133 in the p53 gene (designated as del p53) was detected in doxorubicin-resistant MCF-7 cell lines following various induction processes. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of del p53 and its association with the proliferation, metastasis and drug resistance of MCF-7 cells. The MCF-7/del p53 cell line is a representative of the del p53 stably expressed clones which were constructed by transfection of the del p53-containing construct into MCF-7/wt cells. Markers of multidrug resistance (MDR), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stem cell-like properties were examined in the MCF-7/del p53 cells. The results revealed that the MCF-7/del p53 cells expressed full-length p53 and del p53 mRNA and protein, as well as P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The MCF-7/del p53 cells acquired resistance to doxorubicin with increased P-gp efflux function. Using a transient expression assay, the mdr1 promoter was found to be significantly activated by external or integrated del p53 (P<0.001). The inhibition of nuclear factor (NF)-κB by cyclosporine sensitized the MCF-7/del p53 cells to doxorubicin toxicity. In addition, the morphological characteristics of the MCF-7/del p53 and MCF-7/adr were similar. EMT was observed in the MCF-7/del p53 cells as demonstrated by the presence of the mesenchymal markers, Slug and vimentin, and the decrease in the epithelial marker, cadherin 1, type 1, E-cadherin (CDH1), as well as an enhanced migration ability (P<0.001). Furthermore, the number of cells expressing the cancer stem cell-like marker, CD44, increased, accompanied by mammosphere formation. Taken together, these findings indicate that the expression of del p53 in MCF-7/del p53 cells enables the cells to partially acquire doxorubicin resistance characteristics of the MCF-7/adr cells. Thus, del p53 may be an important factor in non-invasive MCF-7 cells, activating NF-κB signaling and the mdr1 promoter and partially attributing to EMT; the cells thus acquire stem cell‑like properties, which facilitates drug resistance. Therefore, the 21-bp deletion of p53 may prove to be a therapeutic strategy with which to prevent cancer cells from acquiring resistance to drugs.
25881697	[Synthetic lethal genes to mutant p53].	Tongyang L, Haiqiang G, Meiyan Z, Yingze H, Shuting J, Ying L, Jihong Z.	Targeted therapy has become a powerful approach for cancer treatment. Better understanding of oncogenes as well as synthetic lethal interactions with oncogenes will lead to new strategies for tumor-specific treatment. It is well known that mutant p53 plays an important role in tumorigenesis and tumor development. Thus, understanding the synthetic lethal relationship between p53 mutations and interacting genes in tumor is critical for the personalized treatments of p53 mutant tumors. Synthetic lethal genes to mutant p53 can be divided into cell cycle regulators and non-cell cycle regulators. This paper review show these two types of target genes contribute to synthetic lethal interactions with p53 mutations and potential applications of these interactions in anticancer therapy.
26045014	Destabilization of Mutant p53 Proteins Suppresses Tumor Growth.		Sustained mutant p53 is required for tumor maintenance and is a therapeutic target in vivo.
25731619	Down-expression pattern of Ku70 and p53 coexisted in colorectal cancer.	Lu Y, Gao J, Lu Y.	To address the relationship of altered expression of double-strand break repair proteins Ku70 and p53 in clinical colorectal cancer (CRC), we examined the expression pattern of Ku70 and p53 by using fluorescent immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR assays in CRC and pericancerous samples from 152 Chinese patients. The results showed that down-expression pattern of both Ku70 and p53 coexisted in the CRC samples with significant correlating rate (R (2) = 0.9103; P < 0.001), and the down-expression of Ku70 and p53 was significantly associated with the advanced tumor node metastasis stage (Ku70: HR 3.453 in recurrence and 4.182 in survival, P < 0.001; P53: HR 3.114 in recurrence and 4.113 in survival, P < 0.001). The down-regulated Ku70 and p53 were associated with poor disease-free survival. Loss of Ku70 and p53 expression might serve as a biomarker of poor prognosis in CRC patients.
25746004	Tumor-specific signaling to p53 is mimicked by Mdm2 inactivation in zebrafish: insights from mdm2 and mdm4 mutant zebrafish.	Chua JS, Liew HP, Guo L, Lane DP.	In mice, the deletion of either Mdm2 or Mdm4 results in a p53-dependent embryonic lethality. We used zinc-finger nucleases to construct mutations in the mdm2 and mdm4 genes of zebrafish. Although the loss of mdm2 results in a p53-dependent early embryonic lethality, mdm4 mutant fish are viable and grow to adulthood. We also found that an in-frame five-amino acid deletion in mdm2 creates a novel hypomorphic allele. The lethal phenotype observed in the mdm2 mutant fish could be partially rescued by injecting mRNA encoding functional Mdm2, and this required the E3 ligase activity of the protein. Complete rescue was obtained by crossing the mdm2 mutant fish onto a p53M214K mutant background. Although p53 mutant fish on a wild-type mdm2 background were shown to accumulate high levels of p53 protein specifically in tumor tissues, we detected extensive staining of p53 in many normal tissues of the mdm2-p53M214K double-mutant fish. Our results are suggestive of the hypothesis that p53 protein accumulates during tumor formation as a result of tumor-specific inactivation of the Mdm2 pathway.Oncogene advance online publication, 9 March 2015; doi:10.1038/onc.2015.57.

26268751	[Immunohistochemical evaluation of mutant p53 protein over-expression in non-mucinous adenocarcinoma in-situ and invasive adenocarcinoma, NOS of lung].	Cui Y, Zhang J, Da J, Zhang H, Chen D.	OBJECTIVE: To study the over-expression of mutant p53 protein in non-mucinous adenocarcinoma in-situ (NMAIS) and invasive adenocarcinoma, NOS of lung. METHODS: Immunohistochemical study for p53 protein was performed on 17 cases of NMAIS and 70 cases of invasive adenocarcinoma, NOS of lung. The difference in p53 over-expression between the two tumor subtypes was analyzed. RESULTS: The over-expression of mutant p53 protein was observed in 0 case (0%) of NMAIS and 37 cases (52.9%) of invasive adenocarcinoma, NOS of lung. The difference was of statistical significance (P = 0.000). CONCLUSION: Mutant p53 protein over-expression may play a role in the progression of NMAIS to invasive adenocarcinoma, NOS.
26436510	Significance of Ebp1 and p53 protein expression in cervical cancer.	Liu L, Li XD, Chen HY, Cui JS, Xu DY.	In this study, the ErbB3-binding protein (Ebp1) and p53 protein expression in cervical cancer tissues, and its significance in the prognosis of the disease was investigated. Ebp1 and p53 protein expression was detected by immunohistochemical analysis in cervical cancer tissues (N = 60) and normal tissues adjacent to the cancer tissues (N = 60). The rates of positive Ebp1 and p53 protein expression were 35.0 and 60.0%, respectively. Ebp1 and p53 were overexpressed in cervical cancer tissues, compared to normal tissues (P < 0.05). Ebp1 and p53 protein expression was not correlated with age, tumor size, or family tumor history (P > 0.05). However, high levels of expression of Ebp1 and p53 were positively correlated with the TNM stage and lymphatic metastasis in cervical cancer patients (P < 0.05). The combined determination of Ebp1 and p53 expression levels in cervical cancer patients could support the effective prediction of metastatic potential and patient prognosis.
26122615	p53 in survival, death and metabolic health: a lifeguard with a licence to kill.	Kruiswijk F, Labuschagne CF, Vousden KH.	The function of p53 as a tumour suppressor has been attributed to its ability to promote cell death or permanently inhibit cell proliferation. However, in recent years, it has become clear that p53 can also contribute to cell survival. p53 regulates various metabolic pathways, helping to balance glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, limiting the production of reactive oxygen species, and contributing to the ability of cells to adapt to and survive mild metabolic stresses. Although these activities may be integrated into the tumour suppressive functions of p53, deregulation of some elements of the p53-induced response might also provide tumours with a survival advantage.
26014912	The collective nuclear migration of p53 and phosphorylated S473 of Akt during ellipticine-mediated apoptosis in human lung epithelial cancer cells.	Wang JP, Yu YC, Chen SP, Liang HC, Lin CW, Fang K.	Topoisomerase II inhibitor ellipticine effectively suppressed the growth of human non-small-cell-lung-cancer (NSCLC) epithelial cells. Previously, we reported the drug activity was consummated through parallel nucleus migration of p53 and Akt in A549 cells. While inducing cell death, the drug activity was proved related to autophagy through phosphorylated Akt at S473. In addition, ellipticine induced cytotoxicity in p53-null H1299 cells with stable expression of ectopic p53. In this work, we further demonstrated that dominant-negative Akt (S473A) or p53 shRNA inhibited ellipticine-mediated translocalization of p53 and Akt and attenuated apoptotic cell death in A549 cells. The presence of p53 predates ellipticine-mediated apoptotic cell death, assists in nucleus translocation of phosphorylated Akt and activation of autophagy pathway. Growth inhibition through collaborating p53 and phosphorylated Akt(473) in lung epithelial cancer cells provided a new perspective of the topoisomerase inhibitor as an effective cancer therapy agent.
26493683	Modeling the heterogeneity of P53 dynamics in DNA damage response.	Wu W, Sun W, Sun T.	The tumor suppressor p53 can be activated by DNA damage and exhibits undamped pulses. Recent reports have demonstrated a non-threshold mechanism for p53 dynamics. However, no related theoretical studies have been proposed. Here, we constructed a refined DNA damage repair model that incorporated both intrinsic and extrinsic DNA lesions. We proposed that the basal DNA damage may trigger significant fractions of p53 pulses. We also reproduced the heterogeneity of p53 dynamics in experiments. The number of p53 pulses showed no correlations with DNA damage. We also replicated the linear correlation between DNA damage and the probability of igniting a pulse. Our model has unraveled the heterogeneous p53 responses.

26061814	p53 attenuates AKT signaling by modulating membrane phospholipid composition.	Rueda-Rincon N, Bloch K, Derua R, Vyas R, Harms A, Hankemeier T, Khan NA, Dehairs J, Bagadi M, Binda MM, Waelkens E, Marine JC, Swinnen JV.	The p53 tumor suppressor is the central component of a complex network of signaling pathways that protect organisms against the propagation of cells carrying oncogenic mutations. Here we report a previously unrecognized role of p53 in membrane phospholipids composition. By repressing the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, SCD, the enzyme that converts saturated to mono-unsaturated fatty acids, p53 causes a shift in the content of phospholipids with mono-unsaturated acyl chains towards more saturated phospholipid species, particularly of the phosphatidylinositol headgroup class. This shift affects levels of phosphatidylinositol phosphates, attenuates the oncogenic AKT pathway, and contributes to the p53-mediated control of cell survival. These findings expand the p53 network to phospholipid metabolism and uncover a new molecular pathway connecting p53 to AKT signaling.
25374282	Simultaneous Adrenocortical Carcinoma and Neuroblastoma in an Infant With a Novel Germline p53 Mutation.	Courtney R, Ranganathan S.	We present an infant with 2 simultaneous, but histologically distinct tumors with a novel germline p53 mutation. The child was found to have a paraspinal neuroblastoma, a concurrent adrenal cortical carcinoma, and an I162F p53 gene mutation. We review the associations of germline p53 mutations (or Li-Fraumeni syndrome) with both tumor types and the current research in similar germline p53 mutations. Finally, we discuss the multiple ways in which our patient is unique including the paucity of cases with simultaneous but histologically unrelated tumors and the fact that our patient is the first reported case of an I162F germline p53 mutation.
26452133	PRIMA-1met (APR-246) inhibits growth of colorectal cancer cells with different p53 status through distinct mechanisms.	Li XL, Zhou J, Chan ZL, Chooi JY, Chen ZR, Chng WJ.	PRIMA-1met (APR-246) is a methylated derivative and structural analog of PRIMA-1 (p53 re-activation and induction of massive apoptosis). PRIMA-1met has been reported to restore both the wild type (wt) structure and function of mutant p53. Here, we show that PRIMA-1met is highly effective at limiting the growth of CRC cells regardless of p53 status. However, PRIMA-1met induces robust apoptosis only in CRC cells with mutant p53. Upregulation of Noxa, a proapoptotic molecule, is crucial for PRIMA-1met mediated activity. In human xenograft model of disease, PRIMA-1met effectively suppresses CRC tumor growth. Our results uncover distinct mechanisms of PRIMA-1met in CRC with different p53 status, thus providing a mechanistic rationale to evaluate the clinical efficacy of PRIMA-1met in CRC patients with different p53 status.
26497012	S100A4 interacts with mutant p53 and affects gastric cancer MKN1 cell autophagy and differentiation.	Shen W, Chen D, Liu S, Chen L, Yu A, Fu H, Sun X.	The acquired p53 mutations are the most common genetic alterations in human cancers. Mutant p53 proteins tend to accumulate, augmenting their oncogenic potential. However, the mechanisms for mutant p53 accumulation are not known. Previous studies have shown that S100A4 interacts with wild‑type p53. The present study marks the first time the effect of S100A4 on mutant p53 levels in gastric cancer MKN1 cells, which harbor mutant p53V143A, and the functional consequences have been investigated. S100A4 interacted with mutant p53V143A in the cells, and S100A4 inhibition decreased mutant p53V143A levels, indicating that S100A4 promoted mutant p53 accumulation through their interaction. We also found that S100A4 inhibition altered the expression of the mutant p53V143A target genes [c-Myc and inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (Id2)]. Moreover, we demonstrated that S100A4 knockdown increased mutant p53-related autophagy and cell differentiation. In conclusion, our data suggest a novel mechanism for mutant p53V143A accumulation and add a new facet to the role of S100A4 in cancer.
26596470	p53 dynamics upon response element recognition explored by molecular simulations.	Terakawa T, Takada S.	p53 is a representative transcription factor that activates multiple target genes. To realize stimulus-dependent specificities, p53 has to recognize targets with structural variety, of which molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we conducted a series of long-time scale (totally more than 100-ms) coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, uncovering structure and dynamics of full-length p53 tetramer that recognizes its response element (RE). We obtained structures of a full-length p53 tetramer that binds to the RE, which is strikingly different from the structure of p53 at search. These structures are not only consistent with previous low-resolution or partial structural information, but also give access to previously unreachable detail, such as the preferential distribution of intrinsically disordered regions, the contacts between core domains, the DNA bending, and the connectivity of linker regions. We also explored how the RE variation affects the structure of the p53-RE complex. Further analysis of simulation trajectories revealed how p53 finds out the RE and how post-translational modifications affect the search mechanism.
26158292	p53 and rapamycin are additive.	Christy B, Demaria M, Campisi J, Huang J, Jones D, Dodds SG, Williams C, Hubbard G, Livi CB, Gao X, Weintraub S, Curiel T, Sharp ZD, Hasty P.	Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a kinase found in a complex (mTORC1) that enables macromolecular synthesis and cell growth and is implicated in cancer etiology. The rapamycin-FK506 binding protein 12 (FKBP12) complex allosterically inhibits mTORC1. In response to stress, p53 inhibits mTORC1 through a separate pathway involving cell signaling and amino acid sensing. Thus, these different mechanisms could be additive. Here we show that p53 improved the ability of rapamycin to: 1) extend mouse life span, 2) suppress ionizing radiation (IR)-induced senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and 3) increase the levels of amino acids and citric acid in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. This additive effect could have implications for cancer treatment since rapamycin and p53 are anti-oncogenic.
25755280	PATZ1 Is a DNA Damage-Responsive Transcription Factor That Inhibits p53 Function.	Keskin N, Deniz E, Eryilmaz J, Un M, Batur T, Ersahin T, Cetin Atalay R, Sakaguchi S, Ellmeier W, Erman B.	Insults to cellular health cause p53 protein accumulation, and loss of p53 function leads to tumorigenesis. Thus, p53 has to be tightly controlled. Here we report that the BTB/POZ domain transcription factor PATZ1 (MAZR), previously known for its transcriptional suppressor functions in T lymphocytes, is a crucial regulator of p53. The novel role of PATZ1 as an inhibitor of the p53 protein marks its gene as a proto-oncogene. PATZ1-deficient cells have reduced proliferative capacity, which we assessed by transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and real-time cell growth rate analysis. PATZ1 modifies the expression of p53 target genes associated with cell proliferation gene ontology terms. Moreover, PATZ1 regulates several genes involved in cellular adhesion and morphogenesis. Significantly, treatment with the DNA damage-inducing drug doxorubicin results in the loss of the PATZ1 transcription factor as p53 accumulates. We find that PATZ1 binds to p53 and inhibits p53-dependent transcription activation. We examine the mechanism of this functional inhibitory interaction and demonstrate that PATZ1 excludes p53 from DNA binding. This study documents PATZ1 as a novel player in the p53 pathway.
25876901	[Effects of Ad-p53 plus fulvestrant on induced apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells].	Ren K, Qi X, Song J, Wang J.	OBJECTIVE: To explore the apoptosis-inducing effect of Ad-p53 plus fulvestrant in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. METHODS: ER-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells were used. MCF-7 cells were established with control, fulvestrant alone, Ad-p53 alone and Ad-p53 plus fulvestrant. The morphological changes of MCF-7 after drug combination were observed by inverted microscopy. Methyltetrazolium salt (MTS) assay was used to determine the proliferation of MCF-7 cells. The protein expressions of p53 and ER were examined by Western blot. Flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis. RESULTS: Significant inhibition of cell growth was observed by inverted microscopy. Flow cytometry revealed that the apoptosis rate of using fulvestrant alone or Ad-p53 alone was (13.3 ± 1.2) % and (14.5 ± 2.9) %. The apoptosis rate of combined group was (38.1 ± 5.9)% and it was higher than Ad-p53 or fulvestrant alone (P = 0.001, P = 0.001). MTS assay indicated that, after treating for 24, 48, 72, 96 h by Ad-p53 alone or fulvestrant alone, the inhibition of cell proliferation rate was (8.21 ± 0.54)%, (28.50 ± 1.42)%, (50.14 ± 0.78)%, (58.25 ± 2.92)% and (9.73 ± 1.68)%, (25.26 ± 0.82)%, (35.25 ± 3.94)% and (46.37 ± 2.56)% respectively. Simultaneously, the inhibition of cell proliferation rate of combined group was (12.42 ± 1.76)%, (35.20 ± 0.58)%, (62.08 ± 2.56)% and (75.43 ± 3.56)%. It further confirmed the increase of cell proliferation inhibition rate after drug combination (P < 0.05). Western blot showed that the p53 protein expression level increased obviously with Ad-p53 in MCF-7cells. Ad-p53 increased the level of ER expression while drug combination reduced the level of ER expression. CONCLUSIONS: Ad-p53 plus fulvestrant can significantly inhibit cell growth and induce cell apoptosis. And there is probably some synergistic effects between both.
26106979	Lack of Transcription Factor p53 Exacerbates Elastase-induced Emphysema in Mice.	Chrusciel S, Zysman M, Caramelle P, Tiendrebeogo A, Baskara I, Le Gouvello S, Chabot F, Giraudier S, Boczkowski J, Boyer L.	RATIONALE: The transcription factor p53 is overexpressed in the lung of patients with emphysema, but it remains unclear if it has a deleterious or protective effect in disease progression. We investigated the role of p53 in the elastase-induced emphysema model and the molecular underlining mechanisms. METHODS: Wild type (WT) and p53-/- mice were instilled with pancreatic porcine elastase 1UI. We quantified emphysema (morphometric analysis), CCL2 and TNFα in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (ELISA), oxydative stress markers (heme oxygenase 1 (HO1), NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone 1 (NQO1) gene expression), MMP12 expression (immunofluorescence), and macrophages apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3 immunofluorescence). RESULTS: p53 gene expression was upregulated in the lung of elastase-instilled mice. p53 deletion aggravated elastase-induced emphysema severity, pulmonary inflammation (macrophages and neutrophils number and CCL2 and TNFa levels in BAL) and lung oxidative stress. These findings were reproduced in WT mice transplanted with p53 -/- bone marrow cells, except the increase in CCL2. The increased number of macrophages in p53 -/- mice was not a consequence of reduced apoptosis or of an excess of chemotaxis toward CCL2. Macrophages expression of MMP12 was higher in p53 -/- mice compared to WT mice after elastase instillation. CONCLUSION: These findings provide evidence that p53-/- mice and WT mice grafted with p53 -/- myeloid cells are more prone to develop elastase-induced emphysema, supporting a protective role of p53, and more precisely p53 expressed in macrophages, against emphysema development. The pivotal role played by macrophages in this phenomenon may involve the MMP12-TNFα pathway.
24461059	The p53 mutation spectrum in hepatocellular carcinoma from Guangxi, China : role of chronic hepatitis B virus infection and aflatoxin B1 exposure.	Qi LN, Bai T, Chen ZS, Wu FX, Chen YY, De Xiang B, Peng T, Han ZG, Li LQ.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: p53 is one of the most frequently mutated human tumour suppressor genes. Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and exposure to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) induces p53 mutations in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue. The aims of present study are to investigate the p53 mutation spectrum in HBV- and AFB1-related hepatocarcinogenesis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Guangxi, China. METHODS: Tumour and adjacent liver tissue were collected from 397 HCC patients who were subdivided into HBV(+)/AFB1(+), HBV(+)/AFB1(-), HBV(-)/AFB1(+) and HBV(-)/AFB1(-) four groups. All 11 exons of the p53 gene were PCR-amplified and sequenced. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the effect of mutations on the expression of p53 protein. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: P53 mutations were detected in 223 HCC samples, 13 adjacent liver tissue samples and only 1 of 68 normal liver tissue samples. The mutation sites concentrated at exon 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and no mutation was detected in exon 1, 2, 3, 10 and 11. The most frequently occurring mutation was in codon 249 (R249S) in exon 7. Patients in the HBV(+)/AFB1(+) and HBV(-)/AFB1(+) groups had significantly higher mutation rates compared with patients in the HBV(+)/AFB1(-) and HBV(-)/AFB1(-) groups. P53 mutation status and HBV/AFB1 status were independent predictors of tumour recurrence after surgery. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that p53 gene mutations were correlated with the p53 expression. In Guangxi area, the significant association between AFB1-induced p53 mutations and the expression of p53 protein suggest an important role for p53 mutations in carcinogenesis of HCC.
25950477	Acetylation of HDAC1 and degradation of SIRT1 form a positive feedback loop to regulate p53 acetylation during heat-shock stress.	Yang H, Yan B, Liao D, Huang S, Qiu Y.	The tumor suppressor p53 is an essential transcription factor that sensitively regulates cellular responses to various stresses. Acetylation, a critically important posttranslational modification of p53, is induced in response to cellular stresses. P53 acetylation level strongly correlates with protein stability and activity. The steady-state level of p53 acetylation is balanced by dynamic acetylation and deacetylation. Despite the function of p53 acetylation being well studied, how the steady state of p53 acetylation level is regulated in response to cellular stresses remains unclear. In particular, the dynamic regulation of the deacetylase activities responsible for p53 deacetylation during cellular stress is unknown. In the current study, we investigated the dynamic regulation of HDAC1 (histone deacetylase 1) and SIRT1 (sirtuin 1), two major enzymes for p53 deacetylation, during cell stress. We found that various cell stress events induce HDAC1 acetylation. The increased level of HDAC1 acetylation correlates with the level of p53 acetylation. Acetylated HDAC1 loses the ability to deacetylate p53. Cellular stresses also promote the decline of the SIRT1 protein in a proteasome-dependent pathway, which also results in the increase of p53 acetylation. Importantly, the decreased level of SIRT1 also contributes to the accumulation of HDAC1 acetylation as SIRT1 deacetylates HDAC1. Therefore, the increase of HDAC1 acetylation and reduced level of SIRT1 protein during cellular stress directly link to the induction of p53 acetylation. These results unveil the mechanism underlying the dynamic regulation of p53 acetylation during cell stress.
25987028	UBE2Q1 in a Human Breast Carcinoma Cell Line: Overexpression and Interaction with p53.	Shafiee SM, Rasti M, Seghatoleslam A, Azimi T, Owji AA.	The p53 tumor suppressor protein is a principal mediator of growth arrest, senescence, and apoptosis in response to a broad array of cellular damage. p53 is a substrate for the ubiquitin-proteasome system, however, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) involved in p53 ubiquitination have not been well studied. UBE2Q1 is a novel E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme gene. Here, we investigated the effect of UBE2Q1 overexpression on the level of p53 in the MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line as well as the interaction between UBE2Q1 and p53. By using a lipofection method, the p53 mutated breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-468, was transfected with the vector pCMV6-AN-GFP, containing UBE2Q1 ORF. Western blot analysis was employed to verify the overexpression of UBE2Q1 in MDA-MB-468 cells and to evaluate the expression level of p53 before and after cell transfection. Immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down protocols were used to investigate the binding of UBE2Q1 to p53. We established MDA-MB-468 cells that transiently expressed a GFP fusion proteins containing UBE2Q1 (GFP-UBE2Q1). Western blot analysis revealed that levels of p53 were markedly lower in UBE2Q1 transfected MDA-MB-468 cells as compared with control MDA-MB-468 cells. Both in vivo and in vitro data showed that UBE2Q1 co-precipitated with p53 protein. Our data for the first time showed that overexpression of UBE2Q1can lead to the repression of p53 in MDA-MB-468 cells. This repression of p53 may be due to its UBE2Q1 mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation, a process that may involve direct interaction of UBE2Q1with p53.
25713322	p53 protects against LPS-induced lung endothelial barrier dysfunction.	Barabutis N, Dimitropoulou C, Birmpas C, Joshi A, Thangjam G, Catravas JD.	New therapies toward heart and blood vessel disorders may emerge from the development of Hsp90 inhibitors. Several independent studies suggest potent anti-inflammatory activities of those agents in human tissues. The molecular mechanisms responsible for their protective effects in the vasculature remain unclear. The present study demonstrates that the transcription factor p53, an Hsp90 client protein, is crucial for the maintenance of vascular integrity, protects again LPS-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction, and is involved in the mediation of the anti-inflammatory activity of Hsp90 inhibitors in lung tissues. p53 silencing by siRNA decreased transendothelial resistance (a measure of endothelial barrier function). A similar effect was induced by the p53 inhibitor pifithrin, which also potentiated the LPS-induced hyperpermeability in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC). On the other hand, p53 induction by nutlin suppressed the LPS-induced vascular barrier dysfunction. LPS decreased p53 expression in lung tissues and that effect was blocked by pretreatment with Hsp90 inhibitors both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-allyl-amino-demethoxy-geldanamycin suppressed the LPS-induced overexpression of the p53 negative regulator MDMX as well as p53 and MDM2 (another p53 negative regulator) phosphorylation in HLMVEC. Both negative p53 regulators were downregulated by LPS in vivo. Chemically induced p53 overexpression resulted in the suppression of LPS-induced RhoA activation and MLC2 phosphorylation, whereas p53 suppression caused the opposite effects. These observations reveal new mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory actions of Hsp90 inhibitors, i.e., the induction of the transcription factor p53, which in turn can orchestrate robust vascular anti-inflammatory responses both in vivo and in vitro.
25603869	[Clinical significance of mutant p53 protein expression in lung adenocarcinoma].	Bian C, Li Z, Xu Y, Wang J, Xu L, Shen H.	BACKGROUND: P53 is a tumor protein that acts as a tumor suppressor. The mutation of P53 may cause loss of tumor suppressor functions and gain of functions favoring cellular proliferation and apoptosis inhibition. The clinical implications of the tumor protein P53 gene (TP53) mutation in lung adenocarcinoma are indefinite. The aim of this study is to explore the clinical significance of the mutant P53 protein expression in lung adenocarcinoma tissues. METHODS: The clinicopathological data of 120 lung adenocarcinoma patients who underwent surgery were retrospectively analyzed. The mutant P53 protein expression was detected using the immunohistochemical method. Furthermore, the relationship between the mutant P53 expression and the clinicopathological parameters was analyzed using the Chi-square test, whereas that between the mutant P53 expression and overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model. RESULTS: The mutant P53 protein expression rate was 63.3%. Accordingly, the mutant P53 expression was significantly associated with tumor size (P=0.041) and clinicopathological stage (P=0.025). On the one hand, a univariate survival analysis showed that tumor size (P=0.031), lymph node metastasis (P<0.001), clinicopathological stage (P<0.001), and mutant P53 expression (P=0.038) were associated with overall survival. On the other hand, a multivariate survival analysis showed that lymph node metastasis (P=0.014) was an independent poor prognostic factor for overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with lung adenocarcinoma with mutant TP53 had a poor outcome. Accordingly, the mutant P53 protein may serve as a molecular prognosis marker for lung adenocarcinoma patients.
26102039	Ubiquitin E3 ligase UHRF1 regulates p53 ubiquitination and p53-dependent cell apoptosis in clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.	Ma J, Peng J, Mo R, Ma S, Wang J, Zang L, Li W, Fan J.	Ubiquitin-like with PHD and RING finger domain 1 (UHRF1) is a multi-domain ubiquitin E3 ligase that plays critical roles in regulation of DNA methylation and histone ubiquitination. In this study, we found UHRF1 is frequently overexpressed in human clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) tissues both at mRNA and protein levels. We showed that UHRF1 directly interacts with p53 both in vivo and in vitro. A new domain (PD) in UHRF1 was required for interaction with p53. We found that UHRF1 down-regulates p53 transactivation activity which was depends on the ubiquitin E3 ligase function. UHRF1 can promote non-degradative ubiquitination of p53, suppress p53 pathway activation and p53-dependent apoptosis in ccRCC cells. Together, our study suggests that UHRF1, which overexpressed ccRCC, may act as a p53 regulator, suppress p53 pathway activation and help ccRCC cells to escape from p53-dependent apoptosis.
25382750	UBTD1 induces cellular senescence through an UBTD1-Mdm2/p53 positive feedback loop.	Zhang XW, Wang XF, Ni SJ, Qin W, Zhao LQ, Hua RX, Lu YW, Li J, Dimri GP, Guo WJ.	The tumour suppressor p53 plays an important role in tumourigenesis. Besides inducing apoptosis, it regulates cellular senescence, which constitutes an important barrier to tumourigenesis. The mechanism of regulation of cellular senescence by p53 and its downstream pathway are poorly understood. Here, we report that the ubiquitin domain-containing 1 (UBTD1) gene, a new downstream target of p53, induces cellular senescence and acts as a novel tumour suppressor by a mechanism that depends on p53. Expression of UBTD1 increased upon cellular senescence induced by serial passageing of cultures, as well as by exposure to DNA-damageing drugs that induce premature senescence. Over-expression of UBTD1 induces senescence in human fibroblasts and cancer cells and attenuation of the transformed phenotype in cancer cells. UBTD1 is down-regulated in gastric and colorectal cancer tissues, and its lower expression correlates with a more aggressive phenotype and worse prognosis. Multivariate analysis revealed that UBTD1 expression was an independent prognostic factor for gastric cancer patients. Furthermore, UBTD1 increased the stability of p53 protein, by promoting the degradation of Mdm2 protein. Importantly, UBTD1 and p53 function mutually depend on each other in regulating cellular senescence and proliferation. Thus, our data suggest that, upon DNA damage, p53 induction by UBTD1 creates a positive feedback mechanism to further increase p53 expression. Our results establish UBTD1 as a regulator of cellular senescence that mediates p53 function, and provide insights into the mechanism of Mdm2 inhibition that impacts p53 dynamics during cellular senescence and tumourigenesis.
25779964	Forebrain neuronal specific ablation of p53 gene provides protection in a cortical ischemic stroke model.	Filichia E, Shen H, Zhou X, Qi X, Jin K, Greig N, Hoffer B, Luo Y.	Cerebral ischemic injury involves death of multiple cell types at the ischemic sites. As a key regulator of cell death, the p53 gene has been implicated in the regulation of cell loss in stroke. Less focal damage is found in stroke animals pre-treated with a p53 inhibitor or in traditional p53 knockout (ko) mice. However, whether the p53 gene plays a direct role in regulating neuronal cell death is unknown. In this study, in contrast to the global inhibition of p53 function by pharmacological inhibitors and in traditional p53 ko mice, we utilized a neuronal specific conditional ko mouse line (CamcreTRP53(loxP/loxP)) to achieve forebrain neuronal specific deletion of p53 and examined the role of the p53 gene in ischemia-induced cell death in neurons. Expression of p53 after stroke is examined using the immunohistochemical method and the outcome of stroke is examined by analysis of infarction size and behavioral deficits caused by stroke. Our data showed that p53 expression is upregulated in the ischemic region in neuronal cells in wildtype (wt) mice but not in CamcreTRP53(loxP/loxP) ko mice. Deletion of the p53 gene in forebrain neurons results in a decreased infarction area in ko mice. Locomotor behavior, measured in automated activity chambers, showed that CamcreTRP53(loxP/loxP) ko mice have less locomotor deficits compared to wt mice after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). We conclude that manipulation of p53 expression in neurons may lead to unique therapeutic development in stroke.
26585234	Specific TP53 Mutants Overrepresented in Ovarian Cancer Impact CNV, TP53 Activity, Responses to Nutlin-3a, and Cell Survival.	Mullany LK, Wong KK, Marciano DC, Katsonis P, King-Crane ER, Ren YA, Lichtarge O, Richards JS.	Evolutionary Action analyses of The Cancer Gene Atlas data sets show that many specific p53 missense and gain-of-function mutations are selectively overrepresented and functional in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC). As homozygous alleles, p53 mutants are differentially associated with specific loss of heterozygosity (R273; chromosome 17); copy number variation (R175H; chromosome 9); and up-stream, cancer-related regulatory pathways. The expression of immune-related cytokines was selectively related to p53 status, showing for the first time that specific p53 mutants impact, and are related to, the immune subtype of ovarian cancer. Although the majority (31%) of HGSCs exhibit loss of heterozygosity, a significant number (24%) maintain a wild-type (WT) allele and represent another HGSC subtype that is not well defined. Using human and mouse cell lines, we show that specific p53 mutants differentially alter endogenous WT p53 activity; target gene expression; and responses to nutlin-3a, a small molecular that activates WT p53 leading to apoptosis, providing "proof of principle" that ovarian cancer cells expressing WT and mutant alleles represent a distinct ovarian cancer subtype. We also show that siRNA knock down of endogenous p53 in cells expressing homozygous mutant alleles causes apoptosis, whereas cells expressing WT p53 (or are heterozygous for WT and mutant p53 alleles) are highly resistant. Therefore, despite different gene regulatory pathways associated with specific p53 mutants, silencing mutant p53 might be a suitable, powerful, global strategy for blocking ovarian cancer growth in those tumors that rely on mutant p53 functions for survival. Knowing p53 mutational status in HGSC should permit new strategies tailored to control this disease.
25854514	Efficient co-delivery of a Pt(IV) prodrug and a p53 activator to enhance the anticancer activity of cisplatin.	Ma R, Wang Y, Yan L, Ma L, Wang Z, Chan HC, Chiu SK, Chen X, Zhu G.	A nanoplatform targeting DNA and p53 simultaneously is assembled. Layered double hydroxide nanoparticles are co-loaded with a Pt(IV) prodrug and a p53 activator. Once inside cells, cisplatin is released to attack genomic DNA and kill cancer cells; simultaneously, the p53 activator results in active p53, a key protein involved in the apoptotic pathways initiated by platinum drugs. The anticancer efficacy of cisplatin is significantly improved through this synergistic application.
25674170	Predictive Role of p53 Protein as a Single Marker or Associated with ki67 Antigen in Oral Leukoplakia: A Retrospective Longitudinal Study.	Gissi DB, Gabusi A, Servidio D, Cervellati F, Montebugnoli L.	Oral leukoplakia (OL) is the most common potentially malignant lesion of the oral cavity. Immunohistochemical analysis of p53 and Ki67 proteins is a simple and inexpensive method widely used in non-dysplastic OLs to reveal lesions predicted to develop oral cancer. The present longitudinal study evaluated the predictive role of p53 and Ki67 proteins alone or in combination in a group of OLs without dysplasia followed for many years. Seventy-seven OL patients referred to our Department between January 2006 and October 2013 underwent histochemical analysis of p53 and Ki67 expression. OLs were considered at high risk in the presence of either high p53 expression (>20%), or low/normal p53 expression associated with high Ki67 expression (Ki67/p53 ratio >3). Seven OLs evolved to OSCC during the follow-up period. Three cases had p53 overexpression, while four had a high Ki67/p53 ratio. Statistical significance was reached when samples with p53 overexpression were combined with samples with high Ki67/p53 ratio (Chi square 5.3; p<0.02). The combined immunohistochemical expression of p53 and Ki67 proteins could be a useful and simple molecular marker for early detection of non-dysplastic OLs at risk of developing oral cancer.
26419039	[THE ROLE OF TUMORAL STROMA IN PREDICTING OF THE SEVERITY COURSE IN PATIENTS, SUFFERING MAMMARY GLAND CANCER WITH P53 HYPEREXPRESSION].	Shchurov NF.	There was revealed, that the survival indices in mammary gland cancer (MGC) patients in similar stage of the disease, in the same tumor histology, and in a mutant gene p53 hyperexpression, to whom identical complex treatment was conducted, are rhythmic, what witnesses a necessity to search for additional predicting factors. Predicting role of tumoral stroma in patients, suffering MGC with p53 hyperexpression, was studied.
26273641	Translational Control Protein 80 Stimulates IRES-Mediated Translation of p53 mRNA in Response to DNA Damage.	Halaby MJ, Li Y, Harris BR, Jiang S, Miskimins WK, Cleary MP, Yang DQ.	Synthesis of the p53 tumor suppressor increases following DNA damage. This increase and subsequent activation of p53 are essential for the protection of normal cells against tumorigenesis. We previously discovered an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that is located at the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of p53 mRNA and found that the IRES activity increases following DNA damage. However, the mechanism underlying IRES-mediated p53 translation in response to DNA damage is still poorly understood. In this study, we discovered that translational control protein 80 (TCP80) has increased binding to the p53 mRNA in vivo following DNA damage. Overexpression of TCP80 also leads to increased p53 IRES activity in response to DNA damage. TCP80 has increased association with RNA helicase A (RHA) following DNA damage and overexpression of TCP80, along with RHA, leads to enhanced expression of p53. Moreover, we found that MCF-7 breast cancer cells with decreased expression of TCP80 and RHA exhibit defective p53 induction following DNA damage and diminished expression of its downstream target PUMA, a proapoptotic protein. Taken together, our discovery of the function of TCP80 and RHA in regulating p53 IRES and p53 induction following DNA damage provides a better understanding of the mechanisms that regulate IRES-mediated p53 translation in response to genotoxic stress.
26164152	A better experimental method to detect the sensitivity of cancer cells to anticancer drugs after adenovirus-mediated introduction of two kinds of p53 in vivo.	Wang H, Li W, Lai B, Yang X, Zhang C, Li J, Zhu Y.	p53 plays an important role in drug responses by regulating cell cycle progression and inducing programmed cell death. The C-terminal of p53 self-regulates the protein negatively; however, whether it affects the sensitivity of cancer cells to anticancer drugs is unclear. In this study, two experimental methods were used to compare the sensitivity to anticancer drugs of human lung 801D cancer cells transfected with adenovirus bearing either full-length p53 or the deleted-C-terminal p53 in vivo. Adenovirus-mediated deliveries of full-length or deleted-C-terminal p53 were performed after development of tumors (the first method) or by infection into cells before xenotransplantation (the second method). The results showed that infection with the deleted-C-terminal p53 increased 801D cell sensitivity to anticancer drugs in the second, but not in the first method, as indicated by greater tumor-inhibition rates. In addition, compared with the first method, the second method resulted in viruses with more uniformly infected cells and the infection rates between groups were similar. This yielded smaller within-group variations and greater uniformity among transplanted tumors. The second method could circumvent the difficulties associated with intratumoral injection.
26384566	The p53-p21-DREAM-CDE/CHR pathway regulates G2/M cell cycle genes.	Fischer M, Quaas M, Steiner L, Engeland K.	The tumor suppressor p53 functions predominantly as a transcription factor by activating and downregulating gene expression, leading to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. p53 was shown to indirectly repress transcription of the CCNB2, KIF23 and PLK4 cell cycle genes through the recently discovered p53-p21-DREAM-CDE/CHR pathway. However, it remained unclear whether this pathway is commonly used. Here, we identify genes regulated by p53 through this pathway in a genome-wide computational approach. The bioinformatic analysis is based on genome-wide DREAM complex binding data, p53-depedent mRNA expression data and a genome-wide definition of phylogenetically conserved CHR promoter elements. We find 210 target genes that are expected to be regulated by the p53-p21-DREAM-CDE/CHR pathway. The target gene list was verified by detailed analysis of p53-dependent repression of the cell cycle genes B-MYB (MYBL2), BUB1, CCNA2, CCNB1, CHEK2, MELK, POLD1, RAD18 and RAD54L. Most of the 210 target genes are essential regulators of G2 phase and mitosis. Thus, downregulation of these genes through the p53-p21-DREAM-CDE/CHR pathway appears to be a principal mechanism for G2/M cell cycle arrest by p53.
26254280	Loss of p53 enhances the function of the endoplasmic reticulum through activation of the IRE1α/XBP1 pathway.	Namba T, Chu K, Kodama R, Byun S, Yoon KW, Hiraki M, Mandinova A, Lee SW.	Altered regulation of ER stress response has been implicated in a variety of human diseases, such as cancer and metabolic diseases. Excessive ER function contributes to malignant phenotypes, such as chemoresistance and metastasis. Here we report that the tumor suppressor p53 regulates ER function in response to stress. We found that loss of p53 function activates the IRE1α/XBP1 pathway to enhance protein folding and secretion through upregulation of IRE1α and subsequent activation of its target XBP1. We also show that wild-type p53 interacts with synoviolin (SYVN1)/HRD1/DER3, a transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligase localized to ER during ER stress and removes unfolded proteins by reversing transport to the cytosol from the ER, and its interaction stimulates IRE1α degradation. Moreover, IRE1α inhibitor suppressed protein secretion, induced cell death in p53-deficient cells, and strongly suppressed the formation of tumors by p53-deficient human tumor cells in vivo compared with those that expressed wild-type p53. Therefore, our data imply that the IRE1α/XBP1 pathway serves as a target for therapy of chemoresistant tumors that express mutant p53.
25348301	A high-throughput cellular assay to quantify the p53-degradation activity of E6 from different human papillomavirus types.	Gagnon D, Archambault J.	A subset of human papillomaviruses (HPVs), known as the high-risk types, are the causative agents of cervical cancer and other malignancies of the anogenital region and oral mucosa. The capacity of these viruses to induce cancer and to immortalize cells in culture relies in part on a critical function of their E6 oncoprotein, that of promoting the poly-ubiquitination of the cellular tumor suppressor protein p53 and its subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Here, we describe a cellular assay to measure the p53-degradation activity of E6 from different HPV types. This assay is based on a translational fusion of p53 to Renilla luciferase (Rluc-p53) that remains sensitive to degradation by high-risk E6 and whose steady-state levels can be accurately measured in standard luciferase assays. The p53-degradation activity of any E6 protein can be tested and quantified in transiently transfected cells by determining the amount of E6-expression vector required to reduce by half the levels of RLuc-p53 luciferase activity (50 % effective concentration [EC50]). The high-throughput and quantitative nature of this assay makes it particularly useful to compare the p53-degradation activities of E6 from several HPV types in parallel.
25395068	Using an international p53 mutation database as a foundation for an online laboratory in an upper level undergraduate biology class.	Melloy PG.	A two-part laboratory exercise was developed to enhance classroom instruction on the significance of p53 mutations in cancer development. Students were asked to mine key information from an international database of p53 genetic changes related to cancer, the IARC TP53 database. Using this database, students designed several data mining activities to look at the changes in the p53 gene from a number of perspectives, including potential cancer-causing agents leading to particular changes and the prevalence of certain p53 variations in certain cancers. In addition, students gained a global perspective on cancer prevalence in different parts of the world. Students learned how to use the database in the first part of the exercise, and then used that knowledge to search particular cancers and cancer-causing agents of their choosing in the second part of the exercise. Students also connected the information gathered from the p53 exercise to a previous laboratory exercise looking at risk factors for cancer development. The goal of the experience was to increase student knowledge of the link between p53 genetic variation and cancer. Students also were able to walk a similar path through the website as a cancer researcher using the database to enhance bench work-based experiments with complementary large-scale database p53 variation information.
25694087	Effects of Chronic Ochratoxin A Exposure on p53 Heterozygous and p53 Homozygous Mice.	Bondy GS, Caldwell DS, Aziz SA, Coady LC, Armstrong CL, Curran IH, Koffman RL, Kapal K, Lefebvre DE, Mehta R.	Exposure to the mycotoxin ochratoxin A (OTA) causes nephropathy in domestic animals and rodents and renal tumors in rodents and poultry. Humans are exposed to OTA by consuming foods made with contaminated cereal grains and other commodities. Management of human health risks due to OTA exposure depends, in part, on establishing a mode of action (MOA) for OTA carcinogenesis. To further investigate OTA's MOA, p53 heterozygous (p53+/-) and p53 homozygous (p53+/+) mice were exposed to OTA in diet for 26 weeks. The former are susceptible to tumorigenesis upon chronic exposure to genotoxic carcinogens. OTA-induced renal damage but no tumors were observed in either strain, indicating that p53 heterozygosity conferred little additional sensitivity to OTA. Renal changes included dose-dependent increases in cellular proliferation, apoptosis, karyomegaly, and tubular degeneration in proximal tubules, which were consistent with ochratoxicosis. The lowest observed effect level for renal changes in p53+/- and p53+/+ mice was 200 μg OTA/kg bw/day. Based on the lack of tumors and the severity of renal and body weight changes at a maximum tolerated dose, the results were interpreted as suggestive of a primarily nongenotoxic (epigenetic) MOA for OTA carcinogenesis in this mouse model.
25704813	Analysis of p53 transactivation domain mutants reveals Acad11 as a metabolic target important for p53 pro-survival function.	Jiang D, LaGory EL, Kenzelmann Brož D, Bieging KT, Brady CA, Link N, Abrams JM, Giaccia AJ, Attardi LD.	The p53 tumor suppressor plays a key role in maintaining cellular integrity. In response to diverse stress signals, p53 can trigger apoptosis to eliminate damaged cells or cell-cycle arrest to enable cells to cope with stress and survive. However, the transcriptional networks underlying p53 pro-survival function are incompletely understood. Here, we show that in oncogenic-Ras-expressing cells, p53 promotes oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and cell survival upon glucose starvation. Analysis of p53 transcriptional activation domain mutants reveals that these responses depend on p53 transactivation function. Using gene expression profiling and ChIP-seq analysis, we identify several p53-inducible fatty acid metabolism-related genes. One such gene, Acad11, encoding a protein involved in fatty acid oxidation, is required for efficient OXPHOS and cell survival upon glucose starvation. This study provides new mechanistic insight into the pro-survival function of p53 and suggests that targeting this pathway may provide a strategy for therapeutic intervention based on metabolic perturbation.
26410759	Irradiation-injured brain tissues can self-renew in the absence of the pivotal tumor suppressor p53 in the medaka (Oryzias latipes) embryo.	Yasuda T, Kimori Y, Nagata K, Igarashi K, Watanabe-Asaka T, Oda S, Mitani H.	The tumor suppressor protein, p53, plays pivotal roles in regulating apoptosis and proliferation in the embryonic and adult central nervous system (CNS) following neuronal injuries such as those induced by ionizing radiation. There is increasing evidence that p53 negatively regulates the self-renewal of neural stem cells in the adult murine brain; however, it is still unknown whether p53 is essential for self-renewal in the injured developing CNS. Previously, we demonstrated that the numbers of apoptotic cells in medaka (Oryzias latipes) embryos decreased in the absence of p53 at 12-24 h after irradiation with 10-Gy gamma rays. Here, we used histology to examine the later morphological development of the irradiated medaka brain. In p53-deficient larvae, the embryonic brain possessed similar vacuoles in the brain and retina, although the vacuoles were much smaller and fewer than those found in wild-type embryos. At the time of hatching (6 days after irradiation), no brain abnormality was observed. In contrast, severe disorganized neuronal arrangements were still present in the brain of irradiated wild-type embryos. Our present results demonstrated that self-renewal of the brain tissue completed faster in the absence of p53 than wild type at the time of hatching because p53 reduces the acute severe neural apoptosis induced by irradiation, suggesting that p53 is not essential for tissue self-renewal in developing brain.
25974965	UXT, a novel MDMX-binding protein, promotes glycolysis by mitigating p53-mediated restriction of NF-κB activity.	Qi M, Ganapathy S, Zeng W, Zhang J, Little JB, Yuan ZM.	The importance of stress-induced p53 activation has been extensively investigated and well established. How the basal activity of p53 prevents carcinogenesis, however, remains incompletely understood. We report the identification of a novel p53 inhibitor, UXT, which binds to MDMX and suppresses the basal activity of p53. Interestingly, human TCGA database indicates that the UXT gene is frequently amplified in human sarcoma where p53 mutation is rare. We thus used sarcoma as a model to show that UXT acts as an oncogene promoting cell proliferation in vitro and tumor progression in vivo. A screening of 10 major cellular pathways uncovered that UXT-mediated p53 inhibition results in an activation of NF-κB, leading to induction of glycolysis. While elevated glycolytic metabolism provides growth advantage it also renders UXT expressing sarcoma cells heightened sensitivity to glycolysis inhibition. Altogether, our data demonstrate a crucial role for the basal activity of p53 in restriction of NF-κB. By impeding such an activity of p53, UXT unleashes the oncogenic activity of NF-κB resulting in induction of glycolysis fueling carcinogenesis.
26434906	Induction of Apoptosis by Eugenol and Capsaicin in Human Gastric Cancer AGS Cells - Elucidating the Role of p53.	Sarkar A, Bhattacharjee S, Mandal DP.	BACKGROUND: Loss of function of the p53 gene is implicated in defective apoptotic responses of tumors to chemotherapy. Although the pro-apoptotic roles of eugenol and capsaicin have been amply reported, their dependence on p53 for apoptosis induction in gastric cancer cells is not well elucidated. The aim of the study was to elucidate the role of p53 in the induction of apoptosis by eugenol and capsaicin in a human gastric cancer cell line, AGS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AGS cells were incubated with or without various concentrations of capsaicin and eugenol for 12 hrs, in the presence and absence of p53 siRNA. Cell cycling, annexin V and expression of apoptosis related proteins Bax, Bcl-2 ratio, p21, cyt c-caspase-9 association, caspase-3 and caspase-8 were studied. RESULTS: In the presence of p53, capsaicin was a more potent pro-apoptotic agent than eugenol. However, silencing of p53 significantly abrogated apoptosis induced by capsaicin but not that by eugenol. Western blot analysis of pro-apoptotic markers revealed that as opposed to capsaicin, eugenol could induce caspase-8 and caspase-3 even in the absence of p53. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike capsaicin, eugenol could induce apoptosis both in presence and absence of functional p53. Agents which can induce apoptosis irrespective of the cellular p53 status have immense scope for development as potential anticancer agents.
25968838	p53 gene therapy-based transarterial chemoembolization for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: A prospective cohort study.	Shen A, Liu S, Yu W, Deng H, Li Q.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is used for treating unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its efficacy still needs to be improved. Recombinant adenovirus p53 (rAd-p53) injection is a gene therapeutic agent that could improve the prognosis of HCC patients. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rAd-p53-based TACE for treating unresectable HCC. METHODS: Prospective analysis of patients who received rAd-p53-based TACE or TACE alone in Chongqing Cancer Institute from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2012. The primary endpoint is overall survival. The secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, response rate, and safety. RESULTS: One hundred two patients were enrolled in this study. Forty-nine patients received the rAd-p53-based TACE, and 53 patients received TACE alone. The rAd-p53-based TACE treatment strategy improved the overall survival (hazard ratio: 0.58, 95% confidence interval: 0.35-0.96, P = 0.035), progression-free survival (hazard ratio: 0.60, 95% confidence interval: 0.37-0.97, P = 0.037), response rate (P = 0.047) compared with TACE monotherapy. The rAd-p53-based TACE treatment group caused more occurrences of fever than with TACE alone (P = 0.01). However, symptomatic treatment may solve this problem. CONCLUSIONS: rAd-p53-based TACE treatment strategy is effective and safe for treating unresectable HCC. Large-scale randomized clinical trials are needed to verify these results.
26459766	Isoflurane suppresses the self-renewal of normal mouse neural stem cells in a p53-dependent manner by activating the Lkb1-p53-p21 signalling pathway.	Hou L, Liu T, Wang J.	Isoflurane is widely used in anaesthesia for surgical operations. However, whether it elicits unwanted side effects, particularly in neuronal cells, remains to be fully elucidated. The Lkb1-p53-p21 signalling pathway is able to modulate neuronal self‑renewal and proliferation. Furthermore, the suppression of Lkb1‑dependent p21 induction leads to apoptosis. In the present study, whether Lkb1‑p53‑p21 signalling is involved in the response to isoflurane was investigated. A comparison of mouse primary, wild‑type neural stem cells (WT NSCs) with the p53‑/‑ NSC cell line, NE‑4C, revealed that isoflurane inhibited proliferation in a dose‑, a time‑ and a p53‑dependent manner. However, flow cytometric analysis revealed that the concentration of isoflurane which caused 50% inhibition (the IC50 value) induced cell cycle arrest in WT NSCs. Furthermore, the protein expression levels of LKB1, p53 and p21 were increased, although those of nestin and survivin decreased, following treatment of WT NSCs with isoflurane. On the other hand, isoflurane induced the phosphorylation of Ser15 in p53 in WT NSCs, which was associated with p53 binding to the p21 promoter, and consequentially, the transcriptional activation of p21. All these events were abrogated in NE‑4C cells. Taken together, the present study has demonstrated that isoflurane suppresses the self-renewal of normal mouse NSCs by activating the Lkb1-p53-p21 signalling pathway.
25098341	The role of p53 in lung macrophages following exposure to a panel of manufactured nanomaterials.	Belade E, Chrusciel S, Armand L, Simon-Deckers A, Bussy C, Caramelle P, Gagliolo JM, Boyer L, Lanone S, Pairon JC, Kermanizadeh A, Boczkowski J.	Manufactured nanomaterials (MNMs) have the potential to improve everyday life as they can be utilised in numerous medical applications and day-to-day consumer products. However, this increased use has led to concerns about the potential environmental and human health impacts. The protein p53 is a key transcription factor implicated in cellular defence and reparative responses to various stress factors. Additionally, p53 has been implicated in cellular responses following exposure to some MNMs. Here, the role of the MNM mediated p53 induction and activation and its downstream effects following exposure to five well-characterised materials [namely two types of TiO2, two carbon black (CB), and one single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT)] were investigated. MNM internalisation, cellular viability, p53 protein induction and activation, oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis were measured in murine cell line and primary pulmonary macrophage models. It was observed that p53 was implicated in the biological responses to MNMs, with oxidative stress associated with p53 activation (only following exposure to the SWCNT). We demonstrate that p53 acted as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory in macrophage responses to SWCNT and CB NMs. However, p53 was neither involved in MNM-induced cellular toxicity, nor in the apoptosis induced by these MNMs. Moreover, the physicochemical characteristics of MNMs seemed to influence their biological effects-SWCNT the materials with the largest surface area and a fibrous shape were the most cytotoxic in this study and were capable of the induction and activation of p53.
26527653	p53 Activity Dominates that of p73 upon Mdm4 Loss in Development and Tumorigenesis.	Tashakori M, Zhang Y, Xiong S, You MJ, Lozano G.	Mdm4 negatively regulates the p53 tumor suppressor. Mdm4 loss in mice leads to an embryonic lethal phenotype that is p53-dependent. Biochemical studies indicate that Mdm4 also binds p73, a member of the p53 family, with higher affinity than p53. In this study, the significance of the Mdm4 and p73 interaction in vivo during embryogenesis and tumorigenesis was examined. The data revealed that p73 loss does not rescue either the early Mdm4-deficient embryonic lethality or the runted phenotype of Mdm4delta2/delta2 p53+/-embryos. Furthermore, studies in the developing central nervous system (CNS) wherein both genes have prominent roles indicated that loss of p73 also did not rescue the Mdm4-null brain phenotype as does p53 loss. This p53 dependency occurred despite evidence for p73-specific transcriptional activity. In tumor studies, the combination of Mdm4 overexpression and p73 loss did not alter survival of mice or the tumor spectrum as compared to Mdm4 overexpression alone. In summary, these data demonstrate that the Mdm4-p73 axis cannot override the dominant role of p53 in development and tumorigenesis.Genetic characterization of the Mdm4 and p73 interaction during development and tumorigenesis suggests new insight into the role of p53 family members, which may influence treatment options for patients.
25659586	p73 engages A2B receptor signalling to prime cancer cells to chemotherapy-induced death.	Long JS, Schoonen PM, Graczyk D, O'Prey J, Ryan KM.	Tumour cells often acquire the ability to escape cell death, a key event leading to the development of cancer. In almost half of all human cancers, the capability to induce cell death is reduced by the mutation and inactivation of p53, a tumour suppressor protein that is a central regulator of apoptosis. As a result, there is a crucial need to identify different cell death pathways that could be targeted in malignancies lacking p53. p73, the closely related p53 family member, can regulate many p53 target genes and therefore some of the same cellular responses as p53. Unlike p53, however, p73 is seldom mutated in cancer, making it an attractive, alternative death effector to target. We report here the ability of p73 to upregulate the expression of the A2B receptor, a recently characterized p53 target that effectively promotes cell death in response to extracellular adenosine-a metabolite that accumulates during various forms of cellular stress. Importantly, we show that p73-dependent stimulation of A2B signalling markedly enhances apoptosis in cancer cells that are devoid of p53. This mode of death is caspase- and puma-dependent, and can be prevented by the overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-XL. Moreover, treatment of p53-null cancer cells with the chemotherapeutic drug adriamycin (doxorubicin) induces A2B in a p73-dependent manner and, in combination with an A2B agonist, substantially enhances apoptotic death. We therefore propose an alternate and distinct p53-independent pathway to stimulate programmed cell death involving p73-mediated engagement of adenosine signalling.
26379246	Microbial Regulation of p53 Tumor Suppressor.	Zaika AI, Wei J, Noto JM, Peek RM.	p53 tumor suppressor has been identified as a protein interacting with the large T antigen produced by simian vacuolating virus 40 (SV40). Subsequent research on p53 inhibition by SV40 and other tumor viruses has not only helped to gain a better understanding of viral biology, but also shaped our knowledge of human tumorigenesis. Recent studies have found, however, that inhibition of p53 is not strictly in the realm of viruses. Some bacterial pathogens also actively inhibit p53 protein and induce its degradation, resulting in alteration of cellular stress responses. This phenomenon was initially characterized in gastric epithelial cells infected with Helicobacter pylori, a bacterial pathogen that commonly infects the human stomach and is strongly linked to gastric cancer. Besides H. pylori, a number of other bacterial species were recently discovered to inhibit p53. These findings provide novel insights into host-bacteria interactions and tumorigenesis associated with bacterial infections.
25710881	p53 mediates loss of hematopoietic stem cell function and lymphopenia in Mysm1 deficiency.	Belle JI, Langlais D, Petrov JC, Pardo M, Jones RG, Gros P, Nijnik A.	MYSM1 is a chromatin-binding transcriptional cofactor that deubiquitinates histone H2A. Studies of Mysm1-deficient mice have shown that it is essential for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function and lymphopoiesis. Human carriers of a rare MYSM1-inactivating mutation display similar lymphopoietic deficiencies. However, the mechanism by which MYSM1 regulates hematopoietic homeostasis remains unclear. Here, we show that Mysm1-deficiency results in p53 protein elevation in many hematopoietic cell types. p53 is a central regulator of cellular stress responses and HSC homeostasis. We thus generated double-knockout mice to assess a potential genetic interaction between Mysm1 and p53 in hematopoiesis. Mysm1(-/-)p53(-/-) mouse characterization showed a full rescue of Mysm1(-/-) developmental and hematopoietic defects. This included restoration of lymphopoiesis, and HSC numbers and functions. These results establish p53 activation as the driving mechanism for hematopoietic abnormalities in Mysm1 deficiency. Our findings may advance the understanding of p53 regulation in hematopoiesis and implicate MYSM1 as a potential p53 cofactor.
25550548	Influence of p53 status on the effects of boron neutron capture therapy in glioblastoma.	Seki K, Kinashi Y, Takahashi S.	BACKGROUND/AIM: The tumor suppressor gene p53 is mutated in glioblastoma. We studied the relationship between the p53 gene and the biological effects of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The human glioblastoma cells; A172, expressing wild-type p53, and T98G, with mutant p53, were irradiated by the Kyoto University Research Reactor (KUR). The biological effects after neutron irradiation were evaluated by the cell killing effect, 53BP1 foci assay and apoptosis induction. RESULTS: The survival-fraction data revealed that A172 was more radiosensitive than T98G, but the difference was reduced when boronophenylalanine (BPA) was present. Both cell lines exhibited similar numbers of foci, suggesting that the initial levels of DNA damage did not depend on p53 function. Detection of apoptosis revealed a lower rate of apoptosis in the T98G. CONCLUSION: BNCT causes cell death in glioblastoma cells, regardless of p53 mutation status. In T98G cells, cell killing and apoptosis occurred effectively following BNCT.
26343143	Escape, or Vanish: Control the Fate of p53 through MDM2-Mediated Ubiquitination.	Wei J, Yang Y, Lu M, Xu L, Liu F, Yuan Z, Bao Q, Jiang Z, Xu X, Guo X, Zhang X, You Q, Sun H.	p53 protein is a prominent tumor suppressor to induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and senescence, which attracts significant interest to cancer treatment. Therefore, it would be particularly important to restore the wild-type p53 that retains latent functions in the approximately 50% of tumors. MDM2 (murine double minute 2), the principal cellular antagonist of p53, has long been believed to suppress p53 activity through two main mechanisms: promoting degradation via its E3 ligase activity and masking p53 transcriptional activation by direct binding. Targeting MDM2 E3 ligase activity is becoming a potential antitumor strategy resulting from MDM2's decisive role in controlling the fate of p53: p53 is going to degradation when entrapped into MDM2-mediated ubiquitination, where p53 can escape by abrogating MDM2 E3 ligase activity using regulators. The intensive focus on regulating MDM2 ubiquitin E3 ligase activity has led to the rapid progress of its inhibitors, which may be possible to help p53 escape from degradation and restore its function to control tumor growth. This review summarizes the current inhibitors of MDM2 E3 ligase in cancer therapy based on the understanding the regulation of MDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, including post-translational modification, interactions between MDM2 and its cofactors, and regulation of MDM2 stability.
26560363	Regulation of iron homeostasis by the p53-ISCU pathway.	Funauchi Y, Tanikawa C, Yi Lo PH, Mori J, Daigo Y, Takano A, Miyagi Y, Okawa A, Nakamura Y, Matsuda K.	Accumulation of iron in tissues increases the risk of cancer, but iron regulatory mechanisms in cancer tissues are largely unknown. Here, we report that p53 regulates iron metabolism through the transcriptional regulation of ISCU (iron-sulfur cluster assembly enzyme), which encodes a scaffold protein that plays a critical role in Fe-S cluster biogenesis. p53 activation induced ISCU expression through binding to an intronic p53-binding site. Knockdown of ISCU enhanced the binding of iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1), a cytosolic Fe-S protein, to an iron-responsive element in the 5' UTR of ferritin heavy polypeptide 1 (FTH1) mRNA and subsequently reduced the translation of FTH1, a major iron storage protein. In addition, in response to DNA damage, p53 induced FTH1 and suppressed transferrin receptor, which regulates iron entry into cells. HCT116 p53(+/+) cells were resistant to iron accumulation, but HCT116 p53(-/-) cells accumulated intracellular iron after DNA damage. Moreover, excess dietary iron caused significant elevation of serum iron levels in p53(-/-) mice. ISCU expression was decreased in the majority of human liver cancer tissues, and its reduced expression was significantly associated with p53 mutation. Our finding revealed a novel role of the p53-ISCU pathway in the maintenance of iron homeostasis in hepatocellular carcinogenesis.
25906126	High Coexpression of Runt-related Transcription Factor 2 (RUNX2) and p53 Independently Predicts Early Tumor Recurrence in Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma Patients.	Abdelzaher E, Kotb AF.	Conventional prognostic factors for bladder cancer are inadequate to predict tumor recurrence and/or progression successfully; thus, the identification of adjunctive novel prognostic biomarkers is of paramount importance. In this study, the immunohistochemical expression patterns and clinical significance of RUNX2, WWOX, and p53 were investigated in a tissue microarray of 87 primary urothelial carcinomas and 17 control cases. We found that RUNX2, WWOX, and p53 were significantly correlated and overexpressed in urothelial carcinoma cases compared with the control group. RUNX2 and p53 were significantly upregulated in association with high-grade, nonpapillary pattern, and bilharziasis. Muscle-invasive tumors significantly overexpressed RUNX2. WWOX overexpression was significantly associated with high-grade tumors and inversely correlated with age. In a bivariate analysis, the risk of early tumor recurrence and progression was significantly associated with RUNX2 and p53 overexpression and bilharziasis. A multivariate Cox regression analysis proved that RUNX2 and p53 were independent predictors of early tumor recurrence. The ROC curve analysis showed that combined RUNX2 and p53 high expression (scores >3 and >5, respectively) had the highest accuracy (73.6%) for the prediction of early tumor recurrence. We conclude that RUNX2 and p53 might be functionally related and are likely involved in bladder tumor carcinogenesis and aggressiveness, which provides a new perspective for targeted therapy. RUNX2 and p53 independently predict early tumor recurrence in bladder carcinoma patients, with the highest prediction accuracy being achieved on their combined high expression. The role of WWOX in bladder urothelial carcinoma and its relationship with RUNX2 and p53 remains unclear and warrants further investigation.
26596838	Aspirin acetylates wild type and mutant p53 in colon cancer cells: identification of aspirin acetylated sites on recombinant p53.	Ai G, Dachineni R, Kumar DR, Marimuthu S, Alfonso LF, Bhat GJ.	Aspirin's ability to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in cancer cell lines is considered to be an important mechanism for its anti-cancer effects. We previously demonstrated that aspirin acetylated the tumor suppressor protein p53 at lysine 382 in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Here, we extended these observations to human colon cancer cells, HCT 116 harboring wild type p53, and HT-29 containing mutant p53. We demonstrate that aspirin induced acetylation of p53 in both cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner. Aspirin-acetylated p53 was localized to the nucleus. In both cell lines, aspirin induced p21(CIP1). Aspirin also acetylated recombinant p53 (rp53) in vitro suggesting that it occurs through a non-enzymatic chemical reaction. Mass spectrometry analysis and immunoblotting identified 10 acetylated lysines on rp53, and molecular modeling showed that all lysines targeted by aspirin are surface exposed. Five of these lysines are localized to the DNA-binding domain, four to the nuclear localization signal domain, and one to the C-terminal regulatory domain. Our results suggest that aspirin's anti-cancer effect may involve acetylation and activation of wild type and mutant p53 and induction of target gene expression. This is the first report attempting to characterize p53 acetylation sites targeted by aspirin.
26599622	A surface charge-switchable and folate modified system for co-delivery of proapoptosis peptide and p53 plasmid in cancer therapy.	Chen S, Rong L, Lei Q, Cao PX, Qin SY, Zheng DW, Jia HZ, Zhu JY, Cheng SX, Zhuo RX, Zhang XZ.	To improve the tumor therapeutic efficiency and reduce undesirable side effects, ternary FK/p53/PEG-PLL(DA) complexes with a detachable surface shielding layer were designed. The FK/p53/PEG-PLL(DA) complexes were fabricated by coating the folate incorporated positively charged FK/p53 complexes with charge-switchable PEG-shield (PEG-PLL(DA)) through electrostatic interaction. At the physiological pH 7.4 in the bloodstream, PEG-PLL(DA) could extend the circulating time by shielding the positively charged FK/p53 complexes. After the accumulation of the FK/p53/PEG-PLL(DA) complexes in tumor sites, tumor-acidity-triggered charge switch led to the detachment of PEG-PLL(DA) from the FK/p53 complexes, and resulted in efficient tumor cell entry by folate-mediated uptake and electrostatic attraction. Stimulated by the high content glutathione (GSH) in cytoplasm, the cleavage of disulfide bond resulted in the liberation of proapoptosis peptide C-KLA(TPP) and the p53 gene, which exerted the combined tumor therapy by regulating both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. Both in vitro and in vivo studies confirmed that the ternary detachable complexes FK/p53/PEG-PLL(DA) could enhance antitumor efficacy and reduce adverse effects to normal cells. These findings indicate that the tumor-triggered decomplexation of FK/p53/PEG-PLL(DA) supplies a useful strategy for targeting delivery of different therapeutic agents in synergetic anticancer therapy.
26290450	PHD1 regulates p53-mediated colorectal cancer chemoresistance.	Deschoemaeker S, Di Conza G, Lilla S, Martín-Pérez R, Mennerich D, Boon L, Hendrikx S, Maddocks OD, Marx C, Radhakrishnan P, Prenen H, Schneider M, Myllyharju J, Kietzmann T, Vousden KH, Zanivan S, Mazzone M.	Overcoming resistance to chemotherapy is a major challenge in colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment, especially since the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We show that silencing of the prolyl hydroxylase domain protein PHD1, but not PHD2 or PHD3, prevents p53 activation upon chemotherapy in different CRC cell lines, thereby inhibiting DNA repair and favoring cell death. Mechanistically, PHD1 activity reinforces p53 binding to p38α kinase in a hydroxylation-dependent manner. Following p53-p38α interaction and chemotherapeutic damage, p53 can be phosphorylated at serine 15 and thus activated. Active p53 allows nucleotide excision repair by interacting with the DNA helicase XPB, thereby protecting from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. In accord with this observation, PHD1 knockdown greatly sensitizes CRC to 5-FU in mice. We propose that PHD1 is part of the resistance machinery in CRC, supporting rational drug design of PHD1-specific inhibitors and their use in combination with chemotherapy.
25183022	Splice-acceptor site mutation in p53 gene of hu888 zebrafish line.	Piasecka A, Brzuzan P, Woźny M, Ciesielski S, Kaczmarczyk D.	The p53 transcription factor is a key tumor suppressor and a central regulator of the stress response, which has been a subject of intense research for over 30 years. Recently, a zebrafish line which carries splice site mutation (G>T) in intron 8 of p53 gene (p53 (hu888) ), encoding the p53 paralogue, was developed (The Zebrafish Mutation Project). To uncover molecular effects of the mutation, we raised hu888 zebrafish line to adulthood and analyzed DNA, mRNA data, and protein levels of p53 to assess their potential contribution in molecular mechanisms of the mutant fish. To obtain zebrafish individuals homozygous for the point mutation, p53 (hu888) carriers were repeatedly incrossed but only heterozygous mutants (p53 (hu888/+) ) or p53-wild type hu888 zebrafish (p53 (+/+) ) were identified in their progeny. By evaluation of p53 expression changes in the liver of mutant and wild type hu888 zebrafish as well as of Tübingen reference strain, we demonstrated that two types of splicing occurred in each case: a classical one and the alternative splicing which involves the activation of cryptic splice-acceptor site in the exon 9 of zebrafish p53 pre-mRNA. The alternative splicing event results in a deletion 12 nucleotides in the mature mRNA, and produces a shortened variant of p53 protein. Interestingly, expression of p53 protein in liver of both heterozygous and wild type hu888 zebrafish was highly reduced compared to that in the reference strain.
25592872	Misregulation of polo-like protein kinase 1, P53 and P21WAF1 in epithelial ovarian cancer suggests poor prognosis.	Zhang R, Shi H, Ren F, Liu H, Zhang M, Deng Y, Li X.	Polo-like protein kinase 1 (PLK1), P53 and P21WAF1 are relevant to cell cycle checkpoints and cancer biology. Misregulation of PLK1, P53 and P21WAF1 has been detected in several types of malignant tumors. The present study aimed to clarify the role of PLK1, P53 and P21WAF1 in the prognosis of ovarian cancer. PLK1 and P53 shRNA lentiviral plasmids were transfected into SK-OV-3 cells, respectively. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and invasion were examined by MTT assay, flow cytometry and Matrigel assay, respectively. Survival time of the animals was observed in a xenograft model. Expression levels of PLK1, P53 and P21WAF1 were detected in different ovarian tissues by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Their correlations to the clinicopathologic characteristics of the epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cases and their interrelationships were analyzed. Risk factors of prognosis for EOC were determined by logistic regression analysis. The survival time of EOC patients was measured by Kaplan-Meier analysis. After PLK1 or P53 knockdown, proliferation of the SK-OV-3 cells was inhibited, the apoptosis rate was increased, and cell invasion was suppressed in vitro, and the survival time was prolonged in the animals. Expression levels of P53, p-P53 (Ser15), P21WAF1, growth arrest and DNA damage‑inducible gene 45 (GADD45) and 14-3-3σ were upregulated in the SK-OV-3 cells after PLK1 knockdown, but downregulated after P53 knockdown. Higher expression levels of PLK1 and P53 were observed in patients with a higher FIGO stage and worse histological differentiation, but lower P21WAF1 was noted at a higher FIGO stage. Negative correlations were observed between expression of PLK1 and P53 and P53 and P21WAF1 in the EOC cases. PLK1, P53 and P21WAF1 could be used to assess the prognosis of EOC, respectively, but only PLK1 was found to be an independent prognostic factor. The overall survival time of subjects exhibiting PLK1-positive/P53-positive expression and PLK1-positive/P21WAF1-negative expression was obviously shorter than the other patient groups at the end of the follow-up. These results indicate that PLK1 is implicated in ovarian carcinogenesis and may owe its ability to inhibition of the activity of P53. In addition, misregulation of PLK1 coincident with P53 and P21WAF1 in EOC suggests poor prognosis.
25681668	The synergistic effect of combination temozolomide and chloroquine treatment is dependent on autophagy formation and p53 status in glioma cells.	Lee SW, Kim HK, Lee NH, Yi HY, Kim HS, Hong SH, Hong YK, Joe YA.	Temozolomide (TMZ) is an alkylating agent used for the treatment of glioblastoma. The late autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) inhibits glioblastoma tumors in a p53-independent and p53-dependent manner. We addressed a possible beneficial effect of combination treatment with TMZ and CQ by examining the molecular and cellular mechanism of co-treatment. Combination treatment of U87 cell (wild type p53) with TMZ and CQ synergistically reduced cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis, with increased sub-G1 hypodiploid cells and caspase activation. This effect was abolished by a pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK. TMZ induced autophagy, and the addition of CQ further increased autophagic vacuoles. Inhibition of early stages of autophagy by Beclin 1 knockdown and 3-methyladenine pretreatment prevented the enhanced effect of the combination treatment. The combination treatment also upregulated p53 and phospho-p53 levels, whereas p53 knockdown or overexpression of mutant p53 abolished the combination effect. In contrast, combination therapy had no enhanced effect on U373 cell (mutant p53) proliferation and apoptosis within 3 d, although TMZ induced autophagy and co-treatment with CQ increased autophagic vacuole accumulation. However, long term combination treatment for 9-10 d effectively decreased clonal and cellular growth with increased G2-M arrest. This effect was also abolished by Beclin 1 knockdown. Our data support the beneficial effect of combination treatment with TMZ and CQ in glioma via differential autophagy-associated mechanisms, depending on p53 status.
25991017	Rotenone affects p53 transcriptional activity and apoptosis via targeting SIRT1 and H3K9 acetylation in SH-SY5Y cells.	Feng Y, Liu T, Dong SY, Guo YJ, Jankovic J, Xu H, Wu YC.	The protein deacetylase SIRT1 has been recognized to exert its protective effect by directly deacetylasing histone and many other transcriptional factors including p53. However, the effect of SIRT1 on p53 expression at the transcriptional level still remains to be elucidated. In this study, we found that rotenone treatment decreased cell viability, induced apoptosis, reduced SIRT1 level, and promoted p53 expression. Pre-treatment with resveratrol, a SIRT1 activator, could attenuate rotenone-induced cell injury and p53 expression, whereas down-regulation of SIRT1 directly increased p53 expression. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that SIRT1 bound to H3K9 within the p53 promoter region, and this binding resulted in decreased H3K9 acetylation and increased H3K9 tri-methylation, thereby inhibiting p53 gene transcription. In conclusion, our data indicate that rotenone promotes p53 transcription and apoptosis through targeting SIRT1 and H3K9. This leads to nigrostriatal degeneration, the main pathogenic mechanism of motor features of Parkinson's disease. SIRT1, a deacetylase enzyme, has neuroprotective effects for Parkinson's disease via targeting various factors. Resveratrol activated SIRT1 can target H3K9 and regulate p53 gene expression at the transcriptional level, thus inhibiting p53 transcription to enhance neuroprotection, alleviating rotenone induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration. We think these findings should provide a new strategy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
25829127	N-Isopropylacrylamide-modified polyethylenimine-mediated p53 gene delivery to prevent the proliferation of cancer cells.	Zhang J, Wu D, Xing Z, Liang S, Han H, Shi H, Zhang Y, Yang Y, Li Q.	In this paper, N-isopropylacrylamide-modified polyethylenimine (PEN) was constructed through Michael addition and employed as a carrier to achieve the p53 gene delivery, using HeLa (p53wt) and PC-3 cells (p53null) as models. After PEN-mediated p53 transfection, expression level of p53 in HeLa and PC3 cells was up-regulated at both mRNA and protein levels. Due to the exogenous p53 expression, the inhibition of cell proliferation was observed through MTT analysis, attributing to the activation of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Using flow cytometric analysis, early apoptotic ratios of 54.95% and 27.06% after PEN-mediated p53 transfection were detected in PC-3 and HeLa cells, respectively, indicating that PC-3 cells were more sensitive to the exogenous p53 transfection than HeLa cells. Meanwhile, G1 phase arrest was detected in PC-3 cells while a unique G2 phase arrest was identified in HeLa cells after p53 transfection. Through Western blotting, activity analysis of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 and mitochondrial membrane potential measurement, the apoptosis induced by PEN-mediated p53 transfection was conducted in a mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathway. These results demonstrated that PEN could successfully mediate the p53 gene delivery and up-regulate the cellular p53 expression level, triggering a significant p53-dependent anti-proliferative effect on tumor cells.
26470725	Integrin α5β1 and p53 convergent pathways in the control of anti-apoptotic proteins PEA-15 and survivin in high-grade glioma.	Renner G, Janouskova H, Noulet F, Koenig V, Guerin E, Bär S, Nuesch J, Rechenmacher F, Neubauer S, Kessler H, Blandin AF, Choulier L, Etienne-Selloum N, Lehmann M, Lelong-Rebel I, Martin S, Dontenwill M.	Integrin α5β1 expression is correlated with a worse prognosis in high-grade glioma. We previously unraveled a negative crosstalk between integrin α5β1 and p53 pathway, which was proposed to be part of the resistance of glioblastoma to chemotherapies. The restoration of p53 tumor-suppressor function is under intensive investigations for cancer therapy. However, p53-dependent apoptosis is not always achieved by p53-reactivating compounds such as Nutlin-3a, although full transcriptional activity of p53 could be obtained. Here we investigated whether integrin α5β1 functional inhibition or repression could sensitize glioma cells to Nutlin-3a-induced p53-dependent apoptosis. We discovered that α5β1 integrin-specific blocking antibodies or small RGD-like antagonists in association with Nutlin-3a triggered a caspase (Casp) 8/Casp 3-dependent strong apoptosis in glioma cells expressing a functional p53. We deciphered the molecular mechanisms involved and we showed the crucial role of two anti-apoptotic proteins, phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes 15 (PEA-15) and survivin in glioma cell apoptotic outcome. PEA-15 is under α5β1 integrin/AKT (protein kinase B) control and survivin is a p53-repressed target. Moreover, interconnections between integrin and p53 pathways were revealed. Indeed PEA-15 repression by specific small-interfering RNA (siRNA)-activated p53 pathway to repress survivin and conversely survivin repression by specific siRNA decreased α5β1 integrin expression. This pro-apoptotic loop could be generalized to several glioma cell lines, whatever their p53 status, inasmuch PEA-15 and survivin protein levels were decreased. Our findings identify a novel mechanism whereby inhibition of α5β1 integrin and activation of p53 modulates two anti-apoptotic proteins crucially involved in the apoptotic answer of glioma cells. Importantly, our results suggest that high-grade glioma expressing high level of α5β1 integrin may benefit from associated therapies including integrin antagonists and repressors of survivin expression.Cell Death and Differentiation advance online publication, 16 October 2015; doi:10.1038/cdd.2015.131.
26278998	CARF (Collaborator of ARF) overexpression in p53-deficient cells promotes carcinogenesis.	Kalra RS, Cheung CT, Chaudhary A, Prakash J, Kaul SC, Wadhwa R.	Collaborator of ARF (CARF), initially identified as a binding partner of ARF (Alternate Reading Frame), has been shown to activate ARF-p53 pathway by multiple ways including stabilization of ARF and p53 tumor suppressor proteins, and transcriptional repression of a p53 antagonist, HDM2. Level of CARF expression was shown to determine fate of cells. Whereas its knockdown caused apoptosis, its over- and super-expressions caused senescence and increase in malignant properties of cancer cells, respectively, and were closely linked to increase and decrease in p53 activity. Using p53-compromised cancer cells, we demonstrate that CARF induces growth arrest when wild type p53 is present and in p53-absence, it promotes carcinogenesis. Biochemical analyses on CARF-induced molecular signaling revealed that in p53-null cells, it caused transcriptional repression of p21(WAF1) leading to increase in CDK4, CDK6, pRb and E2F1 resulting in continued cell cycle progression. Furthermore, it instigated increase in migration and invasion of cancer cells that was marked by upregulation of MMP2, MMP3, MMP9, uPA, several interleukins and VEGF expression. Consistent with these findings, we found that human clinical samples of epithelial and glial cancers (frequently marked by loss of p53 function) possessed high level of CARF expression showing a relationship with cancer aggressiveness. The data demonstrated that CARF could be considered as a diagnostic marker and a therapeutic target in p53-compromised malignancies.
25721046	Reversible induction of translational isoforms of p53 in glucose deprivation.	Khan D, Katoch A, Das A, Sharathchandra A, Lal R, Roy P, Das S, Chattopadhyay S, Das S.	Tumor suppressor protein p53 is a master transcription regulator, indispensable for controlling several cellular pathways. Earlier work in our laboratory led to the identification of dual internal ribosome entry site (IRES) structure of p53 mRNA that regulates translation of full-length p53 and Δ40p53. IRES-mediated translation of both isoforms is enhanced under different stress conditions that induce DNA damage, ionizing radiation and endoplasmic reticulum stress, oncogene-induced senescence and cancer. In this study, we addressed nutrient-mediated translational regulation of p53 mRNA using glucose depletion. In cell lines, this nutrient-depletion stress relatively induced p53 IRES activities from bicistronic reporter constructs with concomitant increase in levels of p53 isoforms. Surprisingly, we found scaffold/matrix attachment region-binding protein 1 (SMAR1), a predominantly nuclear protein is abundant in the cytoplasm under glucose deprivation. Importantly under these conditions polypyrimidine-tract-binding protein, an established p53 ITAF did not show nuclear-cytoplasmic relocalization highlighting the novelty of SMAR1-mediated control in stress. In vivo studies in mice revealed starvation-induced increase in SMAR1, p53 and Δ40p53 levels that was reversible on dietary replenishment. SMAR1 associated with p53 IRES sequences ex vivo, with an increase in interaction on glucose starvation. RNAi-mediated-transient SMAR1 knockdown decreased p53 IRES activities in normal conditions and under glucose deprivation, this being reflected in changes in mRNAs in the p53 and Δ40p53 target genes involved in cell-cycle arrest, metabolism and apoptosis such as p21, TIGAR and Bax. This study provides a new physiological insight into the regulation of this critical tumor suppressor in nutrient starvation, also suggesting important functions of the p53 isoforms in these conditions as evident from the downstream transcriptional target activation.
26025680	JMJD5 interacts with p53 and negatively regulates p53 function in control of cell cycle and proliferation.	Huang X, Zhang S, Qi H, Wang Z, Chen HW, Shao J, Shen J.	JMJD5 is a Jumonji C domain-containing demethylase/hydroxylase shown to be essential in embryological development, osteoclastic maturation, circadian rhythm regulation and cancer metabolism. However, its role and underlying mechanisms in oncogenesis remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that JMJD5 forms complex with the tumor suppressor p53 by interacting with p53 DNA-binding domain (DBD), and negatively regulates its activity. Downregulation of JMJD5 resulted in increased expression of multiple p53 downstream genes, such as the cell cycle inhibitor CDKN1A and DNA repair effector P53R2, only in p53-proficient lung cancer cells. Upon DNA damage, the JMJD5-p53 association decreased, and thereby, promoted p53 recruitment to the target genes and stimulated its transcriptional activity. Furthermore, JMJD5 facilitated the cell cycle progression in a p53-dependent manner under both normal and DNA damage conditions. Depletion of JMJD5 inhibited cell proliferation and enhanced adriamycin-induced cell growth suppression in the presence of p53. Collectively, our results reveal that JMJD5 is a novel binding partner of p53 and it functions as a positive modulator of cell cycle and cell proliferation mainly through the repression of p53 pathway. Our study extends the mechanistic understanding of JMJD5 function in cancer development and implicates JMJD5 as a potential therapeutic target for cancer.
25526089	A unique role for p53 in the regulation of M2 macrophage polarization.	Li L, Ng DS, Mah WC, Almeida FF, Rahmat SA, Rao VK, Leow SC, Laudisi F, Peh MT, Goh AM, Lim JS, Wright GD, Mortellaro A, Taneja R, Ginhoux F, Lee CG, Moore PK, Lane DP.	P53 is critically important in preventing oncogenesis but its role in inflammation in general and in the function of inflammatory macrophages in particular is not clear. Here, we show that bone marrow-derived macrophages exhibit endogenous p53 activity, which is increased when macrophages are polarized to the M2 (alternatively activated macrophage) subtype. This leads to reduced expression of M2 genes. Nutlin-3a, which destabilizes the p53/MDM2 (mouse double minute 2 homolog) complex, promotes p53 activation and further downregulates M2 gene expression. In contrast, increased expression of M2 genes was apparent in M2-polarized macrophages from p53-deficient and p53 mutant mice. Furthermore, we show, in mice, that p53 also regulates M2 polarization in peritoneal macrophages from interleukin-4-challenged animals and that nutlin-3a retards the development of tolerance to Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. P53 acts via transcriptional repression of expression of c-Myc (v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog) gene by directly associating with its promoter. These data establish a role for the p53/MDM2/c-MYC axis as a physiological 'brake' to the M2 polarization process. This work reveals a hitherto unknown role for p53 in macrophages, provides further insight into the complexities of macrophage plasticity and raises the possibility that p53-activating drugs, many of which are currently being trialled clinically, may have unforeseen effects on macrophage function.
26225749	p53 is required for metformin-induced growth inhibition, senescence and apoptosis in breast cancer cells.	Li P, Zhao M, Parris AB, Feng X, Yang X.	The p53 tumor repressor gene is commonly mutated in human cancers. The tumor inhibitory effect of metformin on p53-mutated breast cancer cells remains unclear. Data from the present study demonstrated that p53 knockdown or mutation has a negative effect on metformin or phenformin-induced growth inhibition, senescence and apoptosis in breast cancer cells. We also found that p53 reactivating agent nutlin-3α and CP/31398 promoted metformin-induced growth inhibition, senescence and apoptosis in MCF-7 (wt p53) and MDA-MB-231 (mt p53) cells, respectively. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with metformin or phenformin induced increase in p53 protein levels and the transcription of its downstream target genes, Bax and p21, in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, we demonstrated that AMPK-mTOR signaling played a role in metformin-induced p53 up-regulation. The present study showed that p53 is required for metformin or phenformin-induced growth inhibition, senescence and apoptosis in breast cancer cells. The combination of metformin with p53 reactivating agents, like nutlin-3α and CP/31398, is a promising strategy for improving metformin-mediated anti-cancer therapy, especially for tumors with p53 mutations.
25641576	Interaction of p53 with prolyl isomerases: Healthy and unhealthy relationships.	Mantovani F, Zannini A, Rustighi A, Del Sal G.	The p53 protein family, comprising p53, p63 and p73, is primarily involved in preserving genome integrity and preventing tumor onset, and also affects a range of physiological processes. Signal-dependent modifications of its members and of other pathway components provide cells with a sophisticated code to transduce a variety of stress signaling into appropriate responses. TP53 mutations are highly frequent in cancer and lead to the expression of mutant p53 proteins that are endowed with oncogenic activities and sensitive to stress signaling.p53 family proteins have unique structural and functional plasticity, and here we discuss the relevance of prolyl-isomerization to actively shape these features.The anti-proliferative functions of the p53 family are carefully activated upon severe stress and this involves the interaction with prolyl-isomerases. In particular, stress-induced stabilization of p53, activation of its transcriptional control over arrest- and cell death-related target genes and of its mitochondrial apoptotic function, as well as certain p63 and p73 functions, all require phosphorylation of specific S/T-P motifs and their subsequent isomerization by the prolyl-isomerase Pin1. While these functions of p53 counteract tumorigenesis, under some circumstances their activation by prolyl-isomerases may have negative repercussions (e.g. tissue damage induced by anticancer therapies and ischemia-reperfusion, neurodegeneration). Moreover, elevated Pin1 levels in tumor cells may transduce deregulated phosphorylation signaling into activation of mutant p53 oncogenic functions.The complex repertoire of biological outcomes induced by p53 finds mechanistic explanations, at least in part, in the association between prolyl-isomerases and the p53 pathway. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Proline-directed foldases: Cell signaling catalysts and drug targets.
25499082	Deubiquitinase OTUD5 mediates the sequential activation of PDCD5 and p53 in response to genotoxic stress.	Park SY, Choi HK, Choi Y, Kwak S, Choi KC, Yoon HG.	Programmed cell death 5 (PDCD5) positively regulates p53-mediated apoptosis and rapidly accumulates upon DNA damage. However, the underlying mechanism of PDCD5 upregulation during the DNA damage response remains unknown. Here, we found that OTU deubiquitinase 5 (OTUD5) was bound to PDCD5 in response to etoposide treatment and increased the stability of PDCD5 by mediating deubiquitination of PDCD5 at Lys-97/98. Overexpression of OTUD5 efficiently enhanced the activation of both PDCD5 and p53. Conversely, PDCD5 knockdown greatly attenuated the effect of OTUD5 on p53 activation. In addition, when OTUD5 was depleted, PDCD5 failed to facilitate p53 activation, demonstrating an essential role for the PDCD5-OTUD5 network in p53 activation. Importantly, we found that OTUD5-dependent PDCD5 stabilization was required for sequential activation of p53 in response to genotoxic stress. The sequential activation of PDCD5 and p53 was abrogated by knockdown of OTUD5. Finally, impairment of the genotoxic stress response upon PDCD5 ablation was substantially rescued by reintroducing PDCD5(WT) but not PDCD5(E94D) (defective for OTUD5 interaction) or PDCD5(E16D) (defective for p53 interaction). Together, our findings have uncovered an apoptotic signaling cascade linking PDCD5, OTUD5, and p53 during genotoxic stress responses.
26549752	p53-dependent apoptosis contributes to di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate-induced hepatotoxicity.	Ha M, Wei L, Guan X, Li L, Liu C.	Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is used extensively in many personal care and consumer products, resulting in widespread non-occupational human exposure through multiple routes and media. DEHP has various deleterious effects including hepatotoxicity. p53 protein is a central sensor in cell apoptosis. In order to clarify the roles of p53 in DEHP-induced hepatotoxicity, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were dosed daily with DEHP by gavage for 30 days; BRL cells (rat liver cell line) were treated with DEHP for 24 h after pretreatment with NAC or small interfering RNA (siRNA). Results indicated that after exposure to DEHP, hepatic histological changes such as hepatocyte edema, vacuolation and hepatic sinusoidal dilation, and increased apoptosis index were observed. In the liver, DEHP induced oxidative stress and DNA damage, which activated p53 in vivo and in vitro. Pretreatment with NAC significantly reduced ROS level and p53 expression in BRL cells. The suppressed Mdm2 also contributed to p53 accumulation. Activated p53 mediated hepatocyte apoptosis via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway, inhibiting anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and inducing pro-apoptotic Bax, cytochrome c and caspases. In p53-silenced BRL cells, hepatocyte apoptosis mediated by p53 was attenuated. PCNA protein level was upregulated after p53 gene silencing. However, the Fas/FasL apoptotic pathway did not exhibit activated signs in DEHP-caused hepatotoxicity. Taken together, DEHP-caused oxidative stress and Mdm2 downregulation contribute to p53 activation. The p53-dependent apoptotic pathway plays critical and indispensable roles in DEHP-induced hepatotoxicity, while the Fas/FasL pathway does not involve in this molecular event.
25727698	The intracellular domain of L1CAM binds to casein kinase 2α and is neuroprotective via inhibition of the tumor suppressors PTEN and p53.	Wang Y, Schachner M.	Cell adhesion molecule L1 promotes neuritogenesis and neuronal survival through triggering MAPK pathways. Based on the findings that L1 is associated with casein kinase 2 (CK2), and that deficiency in PTEN promotes neuritogenesis in vitro and regeneration after trauma, we examined the functional relationship between L1 and PTEN. In parallel, we investigated the tumor suppressor p53, which also regulates neuritogenesis. Here, we report that the intracellular domain of L1 binds to the subunit CK2α, and that knockdown of L1 leads to CK2 dephosphorylation and an increase in PTEN and p53 levels. Overexpression of L1, but not the L1 mutants L1 (S1181N, E1184V), which reduced binding between L1 and CK2, reduced expression levels of PTEN and p53 proteins, and enhanced levels of phosphorylated CK2α and mammalian target of rapamycin, which is a downstream effector of PTEN and p53. Treatment of neurons with a CK2 inhibitor or transfection with CK2α siRNA increased levels of PTEN and p53, and inhibited neuritogenesis. The combined observations indicate that L1 downregulates expression of PTEN and p53 via direct binding to CK2α. We suggest that L1 stimulates neuritogenesis by activating CK2α leading to decreased levels of PTEN and p53 via a novel, L1-triggered and CK2α-mediated signal transduction pathway. L1CAM (L1 cell adhesion molecule) is implicated in neural functions through the cognate src/MAP kinase signaling pathway. We now describe a novel signaling platform operating via the alpha subunit of casein kinase 2 which binds to the intracellular domain of L1. Knockdown of L1CAM leads to increased levels of tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) and p53, known to inhibit neuritogenesis in vitro and recovery from trauma in vivo. By activating this enzyme, L1CAM adds to its beneficial functions by decreasing the levels of PTEN and p53.
24662829	A mutant p53/let-7i-axis-regulated gene network drives cell migration, invasion and metastasis.	Subramanian M, Francis P, Bilke S, Li XL, Hara T, Lu X, Jones MF, Walker RL, Zhu Y, Pineda M, Lee C, Varanasi L, Yang Y, Martinez LA, Luo J, Ambs S, Sharma S, Wakefield LM, Meltzer PS, Lal A.	Most p53 mutations in human cancers are missense mutations resulting in a full-length mutant p53 protein. Besides losing tumor suppressor activity, some hotspot p53 mutants gain oncogenic functions. This effect is mediated in part, through gene expression changes due to inhibition of p63 and p73 by mutant p53 at their target gene promoters. Here, we report that the tumor suppressor microRNA let-7i is downregulated by mutant p53 in multiple cell lines expressing endogenous mutant p53. In breast cancer patients, significantly decreased let-7i levels were associated with missense mutations in p53. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and promoter luciferase assays established let-7i as a transcriptional target of mutant p53 through p63. Introduction of let-7i to mutant p53 cells significantly inhibited migration, invasion and metastasis by repressing a network of oncogenes including E2F5, LIN28B, MYC and NRAS. Our findings demonstrate that repression of let-7i expression by mutant p53 has a key role in enhancing migration, invasion and metastasis.
25384678	p53 suppresses 14-3-3γ by stimulating proteasome-mediated 14-3-3γ protein degradation.	Chen DY, Dai DF, Hua Y, Qi WQ.	14-3-3 proteins are a family of highly conserved polypeptides that interact with a large number of proteins and play a role in a wide variety of cellular processes. 14-3-3 proteins have been demonstrated overexpressed in several cancers and serving as potential oncogenes. In a previous study we showed one isoform of the 14-3-3 family, 14-3-3γ was negatively regulated by p53 through binding to its promoter and inhibiting its transcription. In the present study we investigated both p53 and 14-3-3γ protein levels in human lung cancerous tissues and normal lung tissues. We found 14-3-3γ expression correlated to p53 overexpression in lung cancer tissues. Ecotopic expression of wild-type p53, but not mutant p53 (R175H) suppressed both endogenous and exogenous 14-3-3γ in colon and lung cancer cell lines. Further examination demonstrated that p53 interacted with C-terminal domain of 14-3-3γ and induced 14-3-3γ ubiquitination. MG132, a specific inhibitor of the 26S proteasome, could block the effect of p53 on 14-3-3γ protein levels, suggesting that p53 suppressed 14-3-3γ by stimulating the process of proteasome-mediated degradation of 14-3-3γ. These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of p53 on 14-3-3γ is mediated also by a post-transcriptional mechanism. Loss of p53 function may result in upregulation of 14-3-3γ in lung cancers.
26160678	Schistosoma haematobium egg-induced bladder urothelial abnormalities dependent on p53 are modulated by host sex.	Honeycutt J, Hammam O, Hsieh MH.	The bladder urothelium changes dramatically during Schistosoma haematobium infection (urogenital schistosomiasis). These alterations include hyperplasia, ulceration, dysplasia, squamous metaplasia and frank carcinogenesis. Defining the pathways underpinning these urothelial responses will contribute to a deeper understanding of how S. haematobium egg expulsion, hematuria, and bladder cancer develop in humans. The tumor suppressor gene p53 is of particular interest, given its role in many cancers, including bladder cancer generally and schistosomal bladder cancer specifically.Transgenic mice featuring tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase activity in cells expressing the urothelial-specific gene uroplakin-3a (Upk3a-GCE mice) were crossed with either TdTomato-floxed-EGFP reporter or p53-floxed mice. Mice were administered tamoxifen or vehicle control to induce excision of floxed genes. TdTomato-EGFP reporter mice were sacrificed and their bladders harvested, sectioned, and imaged by fluorescence microscopy. p53-floxed mice underwent bladder wall injection with S. haematobium eggs or vehicle controls. Three months later, mice were sacrificed and their bladders subjected to histological analysis (H&E staining).We first confirmed the phenotypic fidelity of Upk3a-GCE mice by crossing them with TdTomato-floxed-EGFP reporter mice and administering tamoxifen to their progeny. As expected, these progeny switched from TdTomato to EGFP expression in their bladder urothelium. Having confirmed the phenotype of Upk3a-GCE mice, we next crossed them to p53-floxed mice. The resulting progeny were given tamoxifen or vehicle control to render them urothelial p53-haploinsufficient or -intact, respectively. Then, we injected S. haematobium eggs or control vehicle into the bladder walls of these mice. Male p53-intact, egg-injected mice exhibited similar histological changes as their p53-haploinsufficient counterparts, including urothelial hyperplasia and ulceration. In contrast, female p53-intact, egg-injected mice featured no urothelial ulceration, whereas their p53-haploinsufficient counterparts often had significant ulceration.Urothelial p53 signaling indeed seems to affect urothelial homeostasis during S. haematobium infection, albeit in a sex-specific manner. Ongoing work seeks to determine whether p53 mediates associated alterations in urothelial cell cycle status and frank carcinogenesis in the setting of urogenital schistosomiasis.
26364297	Adiposity is associated with p53 gene mutations in breast cancer.	Ochs-Balcom HM, Marian C, Nie J, Brasky TM, Goerlitz DS, Trevisan M, Edge SB, Winston J, Berry DL, Kallakury BV, Freudenheim JL, Shields PG.	Mutations in the p53 gene are among the most frequent genetic events in human cancer and may be triggered by environmental and occupational exposures. We examined the association of clinical and pathological characteristics of breast tumors and breast cancer risk factors according to the prevalence and type of p53 mutations. Using tumor blocks from incident cases from a case-control study in western New York, we screened for p53 mutations in exons 2-11 using the Affymetrix p53 Gene Chip array and analyzed case-case comparisons using logistic regression. The p53 mutation frequency among cases was 28.1 %; 95 % were point mutations (13 % of which were silent) and the remainder were single base pair deletions. Sixty seven percent of all point mutations were transitions; 24 % of them are G:C>A:T at CpG sites. Positive p53 mutation status was associated with poorer differentiation (OR, 95 % CI 2.29, 1.21-4.32), higher nuclear grade (OR, 95 % CI 1.99, 1.22-3.25), and increased Ki-67 status (OR, 95 % CI 1.81, 1.10-2.98). Cases with P53 mutations were more likely to have a combined ER-positive and PR-negative status (OR, 95 % CI 1.65, 1.01-2.71), and a combined ER-negative and PR-negative status (OR, 95 % CI 2.18, 1.47-3.23). Body mass index >30 kg/m(2), waist circumference >79 cm, and waist-to-hip ratio >0.86 were also associated with p53 status; obese breast cancer cases are more likely to have p53 mutations (OR, 95 % CI 1.78, 1.19-2.68). We confirmed that p53 mutations are associated with less favorable tumor characteristics and identified an association of p53 mutation status and adiposity.
26284124	Serum anti-p53 antibody as a tumour marker for colorectal cancer screening.	Iwamuro M, Kawai Y, Matsumoto T, Uda M, Okada H.	A 60-year-old Japanese man presented to our hospital for further investigation of an elevated serum anti-p53 antibody level. He was diagnosed with colon cancer and the tumour was surgically resected. Histological diagnosis of advanced colon cancer without lymph node involvement or distant metastasis was made. It was noteworthy that both serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and a fecal occult blood test that were performed preoperatively were non-diagnostic. This case highlights the potential usefulness of serum anti-p53 antibody tests for detection of colorectal cancers. Moreover, sequential changes in the anti-p53 antibody levels after curative resection were observed.
25961455	Hypoxia-induced p53 modulates both apoptosis and radiosensitivity via AKT.	Leszczynska KB, Foskolou IP, Abraham AG, Anbalagan S, Tellier C, Haider S, Span PN, O'Neill EE, Buffa FM, Hammond EM.	Restoration of hypoxia-induced apoptosis in tumors harboring p53 mutations has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy; however, the transcriptional targets that mediate hypoxia-induced p53-dependent apoptosis remain elusive. Here, we demonstrated that hypoxia-induced p53-dependent apoptosis is reliant on the DNA-binding and transactivation domains of p53 but not on the acetylation sites K120 and K164, which, in contrast, are essential for DNA damage-induced, p53-dependent apoptosis. Evaluation of hypoxia-induced transcripts in multiple cell lines identified a group of genes that are hypoxia-inducible proapoptotic targets of p53, including inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase (INPP5D), pleckstrin domain-containing A3 (PHLDA3), sulfatase 2 (SULF2), B cell translocation gene 2 (BTG2), cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting protein 2 (CYFIP2), and KN motif and ankyrin repeat domains 3 (KANK3). These targets were also regulated by p53 in human cancers, including breast, brain, colorectal, kidney, bladder, and melanoma cancers. Downregulation of these hypoxia-inducible targets associated with poor prognosis, suggesting that hypoxia-induced apoptosis contributes to p53-mediated tumor suppression and treatment response. Induction of p53 targets, PHLDA3, and a specific INPP5D transcript mediated apoptosis in response to hypoxia through AKT inhibition. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of AKT led to apoptosis in the hypoxic regions of p53-deficient tumors and consequently increased radiosensitivity. Together, these results identify mediators of hypoxia-induced p53-dependent apoptosis and suggest AKT inhibition may improve radiotherapy response in p53-deficient tumors.
25605022	p53 activates G₁ checkpoint following DNA damage by doxorubicin during transient mitotic arrest.	Hyun SY, Jang YJ.	Recovery from DNA damage is critical for cell survival. The serious damage is not able to be repaired during checkpoint and finally induces cell death to prevent abnormal cell growth. In this study, we demonstrated that 8N-DNA contents are accumulated via re-replication during prolonged recovery period containing serious DNA damage in mitotic cells. During the incubation for recovery, a mitotic delay and initiation of an abnormal interphase without cytokinesis were detected. Whereas a failure of cytokinesis occurred in cells with no relation with p53/p21, re-replication is an anomalous phenomenon in the mitotic DNA damage response in p53/p21 negative cells. Cells with wild-type p53 are accumulated just prior to the initiation of DNA replication through a G₁ checkpoint after mitotic DNA damage, even though p53 does not interrupt pre-RC assembly. Finally, these cells undergo cell death by apoptosis. These data suggest that p53 activates G₁ checkpoint in response to mitotic DNA damage. Without p53, cells with mitotic DNA damage undergo re-replication leading to accumulation of damage.
25790137	Phenotype specific analyses reveal distinct regulatory mechanism for chronically activated p53.	Kirschner K, Samarajiwa SA, Cairns JM, Menon S, Pérez-Mancera PA, Tomimatsu K, Bermejo-Rodriguez C, Ito Y, Chandra T, Narita M, Lyons SK, Lynch AG, Kimura H, Ohbayashi T, Tavaré S, Narita M.	The downstream functions of the DNA binding tumor suppressor p53 vary depending on the cellular context, and persistent p53 activation has recently been implicated in tumor suppression and senescence. However, genome-wide information about p53-target gene regulation has been derived mostly from acute genotoxic conditions. Using ChIP-seq and expression data, we have found distinct p53 binding profiles between acutely activated (through DNA damage) and chronically activated (in senescent or pro-apoptotic conditions) p53. Compared to the classical 'acute' p53 binding profile, 'chronic' p53 peaks were closely associated with CpG-islands. Furthermore, the chronic CpG-island binding of p53 conferred distinct expression patterns between senescent and pro-apoptotic conditions. Using the p53 targets seen in the chronic conditions together with external high-throughput datasets, we have built p53 networks that revealed extensive self-regulatory 'p53 hubs' where p53 and many p53 targets can physically interact with each other. Integrating these results with public clinical datasets identified the cancer-associated lipogenic enzyme, SCD, which we found to be directly repressed by p53 through the CpG-island promoter, providing a mechanistic link between p53 and the 'lipogenic phenotype', a hallmark of cancer. Our data reveal distinct phenotype associations of chronic p53 targets that underlie specific gene regulatory mechanisms.
26346319	Modeling the interplay between the HIF-1 and p53 pathways in hypoxia.	Zhou CH, Zhang XP, Liu F, Wang W.	Both the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and tumor suppressor p53 are involved in the cellular response to hypoxia. How the two transcription factors interact to determine cell fates is less well understood. Here, we developed a network model to characterize crosstalk between the HIF-1 and p53 pathways, taking into account that HIF-1α and p53 are targeted for proteasomal degradation by Mdm2 and compete for binding to limiting co-activator p300. We reported the network dynamics under various hypoxic conditions and revealed how the stabilization and transcriptional activities of p53 and HIF-1α are modulated to determine the cell fate. We showed that both the transrepression and transactivation activities of p53 promote apoptosis induction. This work provides new insight into the mechanism for the cellular response to hypoxia.
26033683	p53 Modulates Notch Signaling in MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cells by Associating With the Notch Transcriptional Complex Via MAML1.	Yun J, Espinoza I, Pannuti A, Romero D, Martinez L, Caskey M, Stanculescu A, Bocchetta M, Rizzo P, Band V, Band H, Kim HM, Park SK, Kang KW, Avantaggiati ML, Gomez CR, Golde T, Osborne B, Miele L.	p53 and Notch-1 play important roles in breast cancer biology. Notch-1 inhibits p53 activity in cervical and breast cancer cells. Conversely, p53 inhibits Notch activity in T-cells but stimulates it in human keratinocytes. Notch co-activator MAML1 binds p53 and functions as a p53 co-activator. We studied the regulation of Notch signaling by p53 in MCF-7 cells and normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC). Results show that overexpression of p53 or activation of endogenous p53 with Nutlin-3 inhibits Notch-dependent transcriptional activity and Notch target expression in a dose-dependent manner. This effect could be partially rescued by transfection of MAML1 but not p300. Standard and quantitative co-immunoprecipitation experiments readily detected a complex containing p53 and Notch-1 in MCF-7 cells. Formation of this complex was inhibited by dominant negative MAML1 (DN-MAML1) and stimulated by wild-type MAML1. Standard and quantitative far-Western experiments showed a complex including p53, Notch-1, and MAML1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments showed that p53 can associate with Notch-dependent HEY1 promoter and this association is inhibited by DN-MAML1 and stimulated by wild-type MAML1. Our data support a model in which p53 associates with the Notch transcriptional complex (NTC) in a MAML1-dependent fashion, most likely through a p53-MAML1 interaction. In our cellular models, the effect of this association is to inhibit Notch-dependent transcription. Our data suggest that p53-null breast cancers may lack this Notch-modulatory mechanism, and that therapeutic strategies that activate wild-type p53 can indirectly cause inhibition of Notch transcriptional activity.
25958705	[Antitumor mechanism of Bursopentin (BP5)].	Guo X, Wang C, Li X, Wu T, Li D, Chen P.	OBJECTIVE: Bursopentin (BP5) is a multi-functional bioactive peptide with functions of immunomodulatory, antioxidant and antitumor. However, the antitumor mechanism of BP5 is still unclear. METHODS: We constructed T7 phage cDNA library of DT40 cells, and the proteins interacted with BP5 were identified. Then, the expression profile of BP5-treated DT40 cells were analyzed using gene microarray, p53 Luciferase activity was detected. RESULTS: The results of the expression profiling revealed that BP5 regulated expression of 1078 genes, of which 537 were up-regulated and 541 were down-regulated. Differentially expressed genes involved in various pathways were identified, of which 25 pathways were associated with immune responses and tumorigenic processes, including the p53 signaling. Furththmore, BP5 significantly enhanced p53 luciferase activity and stimulated expression of p53 protein in HCT116 cells. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that BP5 exerted antitumor activity through p53 signaling and that this study provides novel insights on the antitumor mechanism of BP5.
25479941	Genetic association of single nucleotide polymorphisms in P53 pathway with gastric cancer risk in a Chinese Han population.	Wu GC, Zhang ZT.	The tumor suppressor gene P53 plays an important role in carcinogenesis, and the P53 pathway is central both in reducing cancer frequency and in mediating the response of cancer therapies. MDM2, MDM4 and Hausp genes are all critical regulators of the tumor suppressor P53. Many studies have evaluated the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in P53 pathway with the risk of common cancers. However, the results are still inconclusive. In this work, we analyzed the association of SNPs in P53 (rs1042522), MDM2 (rs2279744), MDM4 (rs1380576) and Hausp (rs1529916) genes with gastric cancer in a hospital-based Chinese Han population (642 cases and 720 cancer-free controls). We found that the polymorphisms of P53 (rs1042522) and MDM2 (rs2279744) are associated with gastric cancer risk, whereas no significant association was observed between variant genotype of other two polymorphisms (MDM4 rs1380576 and Hausp rs1529916) and gastric cancer risk.
26177745	Concentration-dependent differential effects of an epothilone analog on cell cycle and p53 signaling.	An F, Zhao WJ, Tang L, Qiu RG.	The tumor-suppressor protein p53 is considered to be one of the most important transport hubs of cell signal transduction, playing critical roles in the control of cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and many other processes as a nuclear transcription factor. p53 also acts in the cytoplasm to trigger apoptosis. Paclitaxel and other microtubule inhibitors can inhibit the growth of different types of cancer cells and induce apoptosis which is believed to be p53-independent. In the present study, we demonstrated that UTD1, a genetically engineered epothilone analog and a new microtubule inhibitor, activated p53 as a transcription factor at low concentrations demonstrated by its enhanced transcriptional activity and accumulation of p21, which led to cell cycle arrest. However, at high concentrations of UTD1, p53 was accumulated in the cytoplasm which contributed to induction of apoptosis. These observations indicate that the epothilone analog has differential effects on intracellular signaling and implies that p53 plays different roles in cells exposed to different concentrations of the anticancer agent.
26231043	The presence of wild type p53 in hematological cancers improves the efficacy of combinational therapy targeting metabolism.	Allende-Vega N, Krzywinska E, Orecchioni S, Lopez-Royuela N, Reggiani F, Talarico G, Rossi JF, Rossignol R, Hicheri Y, Cartron G, Bertolini F, Villalba M.	Manipulation of metabolic pathways in hematological cancers has therapeutic potential. Here, we determined the molecular mechanism of action of the metabolic modulator dichloroacetate (DCA) in leukemic cells. We found that DCA induces the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/p53 pathway with increased efficacy in tumors expressing wild type (wt p53). Clinically relevant, low concentrations of doxorubicin synergize in vitro and in vivo with DCA to further enhance p53 activation and to block tumor progression. Leukemia cell lines and primary leukemic cells containing mutant p53 are resistant to the above-described combination approach. However, DCA synergized with the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG to specifically eliminate these cells. Our studies strongly indicate that depending on the p53 status, different combination therapies would provide better treatment with decreased side effects in hematological cancers.
26513173	Depletion of the thiol oxidoreductase ERp57 in tumor cells inhibits proliferation and increases sensitivity to ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutics.	Hussmann M, Janke K, Kranz P, Neumann F, Mersch E, Baumann M, Goepelt K, Brockmeier U, Metzen E.	Rapidly growing tumor cells must synthesize proteins at a high rate and therefore depend on an efficient folding and quality control system for nascent secretory proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The ER resident thiol oxidoreductase ERp57 plays an important role in disulfide bond formation. Lentiviral, doxycycline-inducible ERp57 knockdown was combined with irradiation and treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. The knockdown of ERp57 significantly enhanced the apoptotic response to anticancer treatment in HCT116 colon cancer cells via a p53-dependent mechanism. Instead of a direct interaction with p53, depletion of ERp57 induced cell death via a selective activation of the PERK branch of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). In contrast, apoptosis was reduced in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells harboring mutant p53. Nevertheless, we observed a strong reduction of proliferation in response to ERp57 knockdown in both cell lines regardless of the p53 status. Depletion of ERp57 reduced the phosphorylation activity of the mTOR-complex1 (mTORC1) as demonstrated by reduction of p70S6K phosphorylation. Our data demonstrate that ERp57 is a promising target for anticancer therapy due to synergistic p53-dependent induction of apoptosis and p53-independent inhibition of proliferation.
26572807	Tetramer formation of tumor suppressor protein p53: Structure, function, and applications.	Kamada R, Toguchi Y, Nomura T, Imagawa T, Sakaguchi K.	Tetramer formation of p53 is essential for its tumor suppressor function. p53 not only acts as a tumor suppressor protein by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress, but it also regulates other cellular processes, including autophagy, stem cell self-renewal and reprogramming of differentiated cells into stem cells, immune system, and metastasis. More than 50% of human tumors have TP53 gene mutations and most of them are missense mutations that presumably reduce tumor suppressor activity of p53. This review focuses on the role of the tetramerization (oligomerization) domain, which is modulated by the protein concentration of p53, posttranslational modifications, and/or interactions with its binding proteins, in regulating the tumor suppressor function of p53. Functional control of p53 by stabilizing or inhibiting oligomer formation and its bio-applications also are discussed. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
26588988	Down-regulation of LATS kinases alters p53 to promote cell migration.	Furth N, Bossel Ben-Moshe N, Pozniak Y, Porat Z, Geiger T, Domany E, Aylon Y, Oren M.	p53 is a pivotal tumor suppressor and a major barrier against cancer. We now report that silencing of the Hippo pathway tumor suppressors LATS1 and LATS2 in nontransformed mammary epithelial cells reduces p53 phosphorylation and increases its association with the p52 NF-κB subunit. Moreover, it partly shifts p53's conformation and transcriptional output toward a state resembling cancer-associated p53 mutants and endows p53 with the ability to promote cell migration. Notably, LATS1 and LATS2 are frequently down-regulated in breast cancer; we propose that such down-regulation might benefit cancer by converting p53 from a tumor suppressor into a tumor facilitator.
25832642	Pseudokinase tribbles 1 (TRB1) negatively regulates tumor-suppressor activity of p53 through p53 deacetylation.	Miyajima C, Inoue Y, Hayashi H.	Tribbles 1 (TRB1) is one of the mammalian orthologs of Drosophila Tribbles, which regulates development and cell proliferation. TRB1 is suggested to act as a scaffold protein in signaling pathways for important cellular processes. TRB1 has also been identified as a myeloid oncogenic driver and mediates leukemogenesis through the mitogen-activated protein extracellular kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) transcriptional factors. However, the physiological roles of TRB1 in solid tumors have not been clarified. Here, we show that TRB1 interacts with p53 and suppresses its tumor suppressor activity. TRB1 knockdown enhances transcriptional activity of p53 and decreases cell viability. Interestingly, TRB1 enhances histone deacety lase 1 (HDAC1)-mediated p53 deacetylation and decreases DNA binding of p53. These results suggest that TRB1 is involved in the proliferation of tumor cells by inhibiting the activities of tumor suppressor p53 in solid tumors.
25883152	Integrative genomic analysis reveals widespread enhancer regulation by p53 in response to DNA damage.	Younger ST, Kenzelmann-Broz D, Jung H, Attardi LD, Rinn JL.	The tumor suppressor p53 has been studied extensively as a direct transcriptional activator of protein-coding genes. Recent studies, however, have shed light on novel regulatory functions of p53 within noncoding regions of the genome. Here, we use a systematic approach that integrates transcriptome-wide expression analysis, genome-wide p53 binding profiles and chromatin state maps to characterize the global regulatory roles of p53 in response to DNA damage. Notably, our approach identified conserved features of the p53 network in both human and mouse primary fibroblast models. In addition to known p53 targets, we identify many previously unappreciated mRNAs and long noncoding RNAs that are regulated by p53. Moreover, we find that p53 binding occurs predominantly within enhancers in both human and mouse model systems. The ability to modulate enhancer activity offers an additional layer of complexity to the p53 network and greatly expands the diversity of genomic elements directly regulated by p53.
26177380	Quantitative analysis of male germline stem cell differentiation reveals a role for the p53-mTORC1 pathway in spermatogonial maintenance.	Xiong M, Ferder IC, Ohguchi Y, Wang N.	p53 protects cells from DNA damage by inducing cell-cycle arrest upon encountering genomic stress. Among other pathways, p53 elicits such an effect by inhibiting mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), the master regulator of cell proliferation and growth. Although recent studies have indicated roles for both p53 and mTORC1 in stem cell maintenance, it remains unclear whether the p53-mTORC1 pathway is conserved to mediate this process under normal physiological conditions. Spermatogenesis is a classic stem cell-dependent process in which undifferentiated spermatogonia undergo self-renewal and differentiation to maintain the lifelong production of spermatozoa. To better understand this process, we have developed a novel flow cytometry (FACS)-based approach that isolates spermatogonia at consecutive differentiation stages. By using this as a tool, we show that genetic loss of p53 augments mTORC1 activity during early spermatogonial differentiation. Functionally, loss of p53 drives spermatogonia out of the undifferentiated state and causes a consistent expansion of early differentiating spermatogonia until the stage of preleptotene (premeiotic) spermatocyte. The frequency of early meiotic spermatocytes is, however, dramatically decreased. Thus, these data suggest that p53-mTORC1 pathway plays a critical role in maintaining the homeostasis of early spermatogonial differentiation. Moreover, our FACS approach could be a valuable tool in understanding spermatogonial differentiation.
26216523	The effect of ACP1, ADA 6 and PTPN22 genetic polymorphisms on the association between p53 codon 72 polymorphism and endometriosis.	Gloria-Bottini F, Ammendola M, Saccucci P, Neri A, Magrini A, Bottini E.	PURPOSE: Association between p53 codon 72 and endometriosis has been observed in populations of East Asia but not in those of European descent. Genetic polymorphisms could interact with p53 codon 72 influencing its association with endometriosis, thus explaining these differences among populations. METHODS: 130 women hospitalized for endometriosis and a sample of 250 women without endometriosis have been studied. All women were from the White population of Rome. ACP1, PTPN22, ADA6 and p53 codon 72 genotypes were determined by DNA analysis. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS package. Three-way contingency table analyses were performed by a log linear model according to Sokal and Rohlf. RESULTS: There is an epistatic interaction among ADA6, p53 codon 72 and endometriosis resulting in a positive association between carriers of *Pro allele of p53 codon 72 and endometriosis in women carrying the ADA6 *1 allele. PTPN22 and ACP1 show an additive effect with p53 codon 72 concerning their effect on endometriosis. The strength of association between p53 codon 72 and endometriosis is positively correlated with the number of the three factors considered. CONCLUSION: ADA6, PTPN22 and ACP1 are involved in immune reactions: since endometriosis has an autoimmune component, a cooperative interaction among these genetic systems appears biological plausible. The present result could contribute to explain the differences observed among populations concerning the association between p53 codon 72 and endometriosis.
26358421	Critical review about MDM2 in cancer: Possible role in malignant mesothelioma and implications for treatment.	Urso L, Calabrese F, Favaretto A, Conte P, Pasello G.	The tumor suppressor p53 regulates genes involved in DNA repair, metabolism, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and senescence. p53 is mutated in about 50% of the human cancers, while in tumors with wild-type p53 gene, the protein function may be lost because of overexpression of Murine Double Minute 2 (MDM2). MDM2 targets p53 for ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. p53 reactivation through MDM2 inhibitors seems to be a promising strategy to sensitize p53 wild-type cancer cells to apoptosis. Moreover, additional p53-independent molecular functions of MDM2, such as neoangiogenesis promotion, have been suggested. Thus, MDM2 might be a target for anticancer treatment because of its antiapoptotic and proangiogenetic role. Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive asbestos-related tumor where wild-type p53 might be present. The present review gives a complete landscape about the role of MDM2 in cancer pathogenesis, prognosis and treatment, with particular focus on Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma.
25878193	Activation of p53 in Human and Murine Cells by DNA-Damaging Agents Differentially Regulates Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Levels.	Panchanathan R, Liu H, Choubey D.	Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates multiple cellular processes. The anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) can activate AhR-mediated transcription of target genes. Because DOX in cells activates a DNA damage response involving ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)-mediated activation of p53, we investigated whether the activation of the p53 in cells by DNA-damaging agents such as DOX or bleomycin could regulate the AhR levels. Here we report that activation of p53 by DNA-damaging agents in human cells increased levels of AhR through a posttranscriptional mechanism. Accordingly, fibroblasts from ATM patients, which are defective in p53 activation, expressed reduced constitutive levels of AhR and treatment of cells with bleomycin did not appreciably increase the AhR levels. Further, activation of p53 in cells stimulated the expression of AhR target genes. In murine cells, activation of p53 reduced the levels of AhR messenger RNA and protein and reduced the expression of AhR target genes. Our observations revealed that activation of p53 in human and murine cells differentially regulates AhR levels.
25995008	The impact of p53 on DNA damage and metabolic activation of the environmental carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene: effects in Trp53(+/+), Trp53(+/-) and Trp53(-/-) mice.	Krais AM, Speksnijder EN, Melis JP, Indra R, Moserova M, Godschalk RW, van Schooten FJ, Seidel A, Kopka K, Schmeiser HH, Stiborova M, Phillips DH, Luijten M, Arlt VM.	The tumour suppressor p53 is one of the most important cancer genes. Previous findings have shown that p53 expression can influence DNA adduct formation of the environmental carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) in human cells, indicating a role for p53 in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1-mediated biotransformation of BaP in vitro. We investigated the potential role of p53 in xenobiotic metabolism in vivo by treating Trp53(+/+), Trp53(+/-) and Trp53(-/-) mice with BaP. BaP-DNA adduct levels, as measured by (32)P-postlabelling analysis, were significantly higher in liver and kidney of Trp53(-/-) mice than of Trp53(+/+) mice. Complementarily, significantly higher amounts of BaP metabolites were also formed ex vivo in hepatic microsomes from BaP-pretreated Trp53(-/-) mice. Bypass of the need for metabolic activation by treating mice with BaP-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide resulted in similar adduct levels in liver and kidney in all mouse lines, confirming that the influence of p53 is on the biotransformation of the parent compound. Higher BaP-DNA adduct levels in the livers of Trp53(-/-) mice correlated with higher CYP1A protein levels and increased CYP1A enzyme activity in these animals. Our study demonstrates a role for p53 in the metabolism of BaP in vivo, confirming previous in vitro results on a novel role for p53 in CYP1A1-mediated BaP metabolism. However, our results also suggest that the mechanisms involved in the altered expression and activity of the CYP1A1 enzyme by p53 in vitro and in vivo are different.
25464270	CUL4B impedes stress-induced cellular senescence by dampening a p53-reactive oxygen species positive feedback loop.	Wei Z, Guo H, Liu Z, Zhang X, Liu Q, Qian Y, Gong Y, Shao C.	Tumor suppressor p53 is known to regulate the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). It can either alleviate oxidative stress under physiological and mildly stressed conditions or exacerbate oxidative stress under highly stressed conditions. We here report that a p53-ROS positive feedback loop drives a senescence program in normal human fibroblasts (NHFs) and this senescence-driving loop is negatively regulated by CUL4B. CUL4B, which can assemble various ubiquitin E3 ligases, was found to be downregulated in stress-induced senescent cells, but not in replicative senescent cells. We observed that p53-dependent ROS production was significantly augmented and stress-induced senescence was greatly enhanced when CUL4B was absent or depleted. Ectopic expression of CUL4B, on the other hand, blunted p53 activation, reduced ROS production, and attenuated cellular senescence in cells treated with H2O2. CUL4B was shown to promote p53 ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation in NHFs exposed to oxidative stress, thus dampening the p53-dependent cellular senescence. Together, our results established a critical role of CUL4B in negatively regulating the p53-ROS positive feedback loop that drives cellular senescence.
25567130	The MDM2 Inhibitor AMG 232 Demonstrates Robust Antitumor Efficacy and Potentiates the Activity of p53-Inducing Cytotoxic Agents.	Canon J, Osgood T, Olson SH, Saiki AY, Robertson R, Yu D, Eksterowicz J, Ye Q, Jin L, Chen A, Zhou J, Cordover D, Kaufman S, Kendall R, Oliner JD, Coxon A, Radinsky R.	p53 is a critical tumor suppressor and is the most frequently inactivated gene in human cancer. Inhibition of the interaction of p53 with its negative regulator MDM2 represents a promising clinical strategy to treat p53 wild-type tumors. AMG 232 is a potential best-in-class inhibitor of the MDM2-p53 interaction and is currently in clinical trials. We characterized the activity of AMG 232 and its effect on p53 signaling in several preclinical tumor models. AMG 232 binds the MDM2 protein with picomolar affinity and robustly induces p53 activity, leading to cell-cycle arrest and inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. AMG 232 treatment inhibited the in vivo growth of several tumor xenografts and led to complete and durable regression of MDM2-amplified SJSA-1 tumors via growth arrest and induction of apoptosis. Therapeutic combination studies of AMG 232 with chemotherapies that induce DNA damage and p53 activity resulted in significantly superior antitumor efficacy and regression, and markedly increased activation of p53 signaling in tumors. These preclinical data support the further evaluation of AMG 232 in clinical trials as both a monotherapy and in combination with standard-of-care cytotoxics.
25749422	WP1130 increases doxorubicin sensitivity in hepatocellular carcinoma cells through usp9x-dependent p53 degradation.	Liu H, Chen W, Liang C, Chen BW, Zhi X, Zhang S, Zheng X, Bai X, Liang T.	Resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs is a major obstacle in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) therapy. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Recent evidence suggests that deubiquitinases (DUB) are key regulators in the mechanisms of cell proliferation, apoptosis and chemoresistance. The present study aimed to investigate whether WP1130, which inhibits activity of deubiquitinases, exerts synergistic cytotoxicity with doxorubicin in HCC and the underlying mechanisms. In the study, we found that Huh7, HepG2, and SNU387 HCC cells with p53 expression displayed enhanced response to the combination therapy compared with p53-deficient HCC cells (Hep3B) in the manner of inhibiting cell proliferation. Downregulation of p53 abolished the synergistic cytotoxicity of doxorubicin and WP1130 on HCC cells. Mechanistically, we found that combined treatment with WP1130 suppressed doxorubicin-mediated upregulation of p53 via promoting its ubiquitin-proteasome dependent degradation, whereas knockdown of DUB usp9x abolished this effect. Taken together, these results demonstrate that combined treatment with WP1130 sensitized HCC cells to doxorubicin via usp9x-depedent p53 degradation.
26220644	The miR-1000-p53 pathway regulates apoptosis and virus infection in shrimp.	Gong Y, Ju C, Zhang X.	The p53 protein plays an important role in apoptosis which is involved in the immunity of animals. However, effects of the miRNA-mediated regulation of p53 expression on apoptosis and virus infection are not extensively investigated. To address this issue, the miRNA-mediated p53-dependent apoptotic pathway was explored in this study. The results indicated that p53 could regulate the apoptotic activity of Marsupenaeus japonicas shrimp and influence the infection of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). The further data presented that miR-1000 could target the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of p53 gene. The results of in vivo experiments showed that the miR-1000 overexpression led to significant decreases of shrimp apoptotic activity and the capacity of WSSV infection, while the miR-1000 silencing resulted in significant increases of apoptotic activity and virus infection, indicating that miR-1000 took great effects on apoptosis and virus infection by targeting p53. Therefore, our study revealed a novel mechanism that the miR-1000-p53 pathway regulated apoptosis and virus infection in shrimp.
26107560	Immunophenotypic Analysis in Early Mullerian Serous Carcinogenesis.	Nafisi H, Ghorab Z, Ismill N, Dubé V, Plotkin A, Han G, Cesari M, Lu FI, Saad R, Khalifa M, Nofech-Mozes S.	Studies on the immunophenotypes of early forms of serous carcinoma arising from female genital tract are limited. We aimed to examine p53, p16(Ink4a), estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), ERBB2, WT1, and Ki-67 protein expression in endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma (n=29), serous tubal intraepithelial lesion (n=4) and carcinoma (STIC, n=10), and the putative precursor p53 signature (n=11). Among endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma, 80% demonstrated p53 overexpression and 10% were consistent with a null phenotype. p16(Ink4a) immunostaining were observed in all endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma cases. ER, PR, ERBB2, and WT1 were positive in 54%, 25%, 11%, and 18% of cases, respectively. STIC cases demonstrated p53 overexpression and null phenotype in 90% and 10%, respectively. All STIC cases were p16(Ink4a) and WT1 positive, whereas ER and PR were positive in 70% and 20%, respectively. All STICs were negative for ERBB2. Among serous tubal intraepithelial lesion cases, 75% demonstrated p53 overexpression and 25% a null phenotype. p53 was positive in all 11 p53 signature cases, whereas p16(Ink4a) was universally negative. Finally, ER and PR were positive in 100% and 73% of p53 signature cases, respectively. These results suggest that p16(Ink4a) has a role in early Müllerian serous carcinogenesis but is absent in the earliest noncommitted lesion. p16(Ink4a) immunohistochemistry can be used as an adjunct confirmatory tool in p53-null cases with limited surface area.
26397233	MicroRNA-203 induces apoptosis by upregulating Puma expression in colon and lung cancer cells.	Funamizu N, Lacy CR, Kamada M, Yanaga K, Manome Y.	The present study investigated the relationship between microRNA-203 (miR-203) and the p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (Puma) in colon (HCT116) and lung cancer (A549) cells. Colon and lung cancer cell lines were selected for this study since a relationship between p53/miR-203 and p53/Puma has been established in both cancers. In the present study, adriamycin and nutlin-3 were used to activate p53, which induced both miR-203 and Puma expression in HCT116 cells. In contrast, HCT 116 cells with downregulated p53 showed decreased miR-203 and Puma expression. Importantly, we found that overexpressed miR-203 in HCT116 cells resulted in significantly increased Puma expression (P<0.05). Based on these findings, we hypothesized that another limb of the p53/Puma axis depends on miR-203 expression. To further validate this relationship, we used lung cancer cells (A549) and found that activated p53 increased both miR-203 and Puma expression. In addition, we found that Puma expression remained elevated in cells with overexpressed miR-203 in the presence of p53 downregulation. Cumulatively, our data purport that p53 not only increased Puma expression directly, but that it may also do so through miR-203. Additionally, functional studies revealed that miR-203 overexpression induced apoptosis and inhibited cell invasiveness.
26352900	Low temperature induces cryoinjury in mouse corneal endothelial cells by stimulating the Stk11-p53 signal pathway.	Zhao S, Fei X, Liu T, Liu Y.	Cryoinjury, or injury caused by extremely low temperatures, can occur in corneal endothelial cells (CECs) and lead to visual impairment. However, the mechanism of cryoinjury in CECs is not clear. The Stk11‑p53 signaling pathway regulates the proliferation and division of cells. Activity of the Stk11‑p53 signaling pathway arrests the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase and induces apoptosis. In this study, a mouse model of cryoinjury in CECs was used. Following injury, significant mouse CEC death and shedding were observed. In addition, the mRNA and protein levels of core factors from the Stk11‑p53 signaling pathway (Stk11, p21 and p53) were elevated and Caspase‑3 was activated following cryoinjury. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that Stk11 catalyzed p53 serine 15 phosphorylation, and the Stk11‑p53 complex bound to the p21 promoter and stimulated gene transcription. Thus, the results of the present study suggest that cryoinjury leads to the damage and apoptosis of mouse CECs by activation of the Stk11‑p53 signaling pathway, phosphorylation of p53 serine 15 and p21 gene transcription.
26512706	Novel Implications of DNA Damage Response in Drug Resistance of Malignant Cancers Obtained from the Functional Interaction between p53 Family and RUNX2.	Ozaki T, Nakamura M, Shimozato O.	During the lifespan of cells, their genomic DNA is continuously exposed to theendogenous and exogenous DNA insults. Thus, the appropriate cellular response to DNAdamage plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic integrity and also acts as a molecularbarrier towards DNA legion-mediated carcinogenesis. The tumor suppressor p53 participatesin an integral part of proper regulation of DNA damage response (DDR). p53 is frequentlymutated in a variety of human cancers. Since mutant p53 displays a dominant-negative behavioragainst wild-type p53, cancers expressing mutant p53 sometimes acquire drug-resistantphenotype, suggesting that mutant p53 prohibits the p53-dependent cell death pathwayfollowing DNA damage, and thereby contributing to the acquisition and/or maintenance ofdrug resistance of malignant cancers. Intriguingly, we have recently found that silencing ofpro-oncogenic RUNX2 enhances drug sensitivity of aggressive cancer cells regardless of p53status. Meanwhile, cancer stem cells (CSCs) have stem cell properties such as drug resistance.Therefore, the precise understanding of the biology of CSCs is quite important to overcometheir drug resistance. In this review, we focus on molecular mechanisms behind DDR as wellas the serious drug resistance of malignant cancers and discuss some attractive approachesto improving the outcomes of patients bearing drug-resistant cancers.
25578727	The deubiquitinating enzyme USP24 is a regulator of the UV damage response.	Zhang L, Nemzow L, Chen H, Lubin A, Rong X, Sun Z, Harris TK, Gong F.	Regulation of p53 by ubiquitination and deubiquitination is important for its function. In this study, we demonstrate that USP24 deubiquitinates p53 in human cells. Functional USP24 is required for p53 stabilization, and p53 destabilization in USP24-depleted cells can be corrected by the forced expression of USP24. We show that USP24 depletion renders cells resistant to apoptosis after UV irradiation, consistent with the requirement of USP24 for p53 stabilization and PUMA activation in vivo. Additionally, purified USP24 protein is able to cleave ubiquitinated p53 in vitro. Importantly, cells with USP24 depletion exhibited significantly elevated mutation rates at the endogenous HPRT locus, implying an important role for USP24 in maintaining genome stability. Our data reveal that the USP24 deubiquitinase regulates the DNA damage response by directly targeting the p53 tumor suppressor.
25171290	p53 expression as a prognostic factor in upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	Lee JY, Cho KS, Diaz RR, Choi YD, Choi HY.	To conduct a meta-analysis examining p53 expression as a potential risk factor in upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UUT-UC) and to systematically review the available data.A comprehensive literature review was performed from January 1991 to August 2012, using search engines such as PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and KoreaMed. All retrieved references were manually reviewed, and two authors independently extracted the data. The quality of case-control and cohort studies was assessed using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) checklists. Heterogeneity among studies was examined using the Q statistics and Higgins' I(2) statistic.Of 302 abstracts of original research studies, nine case-control trials fit our criteria for inclusion in the analysis. Of the nine articles included, four scored 'low' and five scored 'modest' in the quality assessment performed according to the SIGN checklists. Analysis of the correlation between different factors and p53 expression in UUT-UC showed that pathologic stage (≥pT3 or <pT3) differed significantly between the p53 and non-p53 groups (OR = 2.720, p < 0.001). Statistically significant correlations were also detected between p53 expression and histologic grade (OR = 4.507, p < 0.001) and female gender (OR = 2.724, p < 0.001).The results of our meta-analysis suggest that p53 expression in UUT-UC was correlated with advanced pathologic stage, high histologic grade and female gender.
25789565	p38/p53/miR-200a-3p feedback loop promotes oxidative stress-mediated liver cell death.	Xiao Y, Yan W, Lu L, Wang Y, Lu W, Cao Y, Cai W.	Although our previous studies have provided evidence that oxidative stress has an essential role in total parenteral nutrition (TPN)-associated liver injury, the mechanisms involved are incompletely understood. Here, we show the existence of crosstalk between the miR-200 family of microRNAs and oxidative stress. The members of the miR-200 family are markedly enhanced in hepatic cells by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment. The upregulation of miR-200-3p in turn modulates the H2O2-mediated oxidative stress response by targeting p38α. The enhanced expression of miR-200-3p mimics p38α deficiency and promotes H2O2-induced cell death. Members of the miR-200 family that are known to inhibit the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) are induced by the tumor suppressor p53. Here, we show that p53 phosphorylation at Ser 33 contributes to H2O2-induced miR-200s transcription. In addition, we show that p38α can directly phosphorylate p53 at serine 33 upon H2O2 exposure. Thus, we suggest that in liver cells, the oxidative stress-induced, p38α-mediated phosphorylation of p53 at Ser33 is essential for the functional regulation of oxidative stress-induced miR-200 transcription by p53. Collectively, our data indicate that the p53-dependent expression of miR-200a-3p promotes cell death by inhibiting a p38/p53/miR-200 feedback loop.
26314369	Zn(II)-curc targets p53 in thyroid cancer cells.	Garufi A, D'Orazi V, Crispini A, D'Orazi G.	TP53 mutation is a common event in many cancers, including thyroid carcinoma. Defective p53 activity promotes cancer resistance to therapies and a more malignant phenotype, acquiring oncogenic functions. Rescuing the function of mutant p53 (mutp53) protein is an attractive anticancer therapeutic strategy. Zn(II)-curc is a novel small molecule that has been shown to target mutp53 protein in several cancer cells, but its effect in thyroid cancer cells remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether Zn(II)-curc could affect p53 in thyroid cancer cells with both p53 mutation (R273H) and wild-type p53. Zn(II)-curc induced mutp53H273 downregulation and reactivation of wild-type functions, such as binding to canonical target promoters and target gene transactivation. This latter effect was similar to that induced by PRIMA-1. In addition, Zn(II)-curc triggered p53 target gene expression in wild-type p53-carrying cells. In combination treatments, Zn(II)-curc enhanced the antitumor activity of chemotherapeutic drugs, in both mutant and wild-type-carrying cancer cells. Taken together, our data indicate that Zn(II)-curc promotes the reactivation of p53 in thyroid cancer cells, providing in vitro evidence for a potential therapeutic approach in thyroid cancers.
26148235	RING finger protein 31 promotes p53 degradation in breast cancer cells.	Zhu J, Zhao C, Zhuang T, Jonsson P, Sinha I, Williams C, Strömblad S, Dahlman-Wright K.	The atypical E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF31 is highly expressed in human breast cancer, the most frequent neoplastic lethality among women. Here, RNF31 depletion in breast cancer cells in combination with global gene expression profiling revealed p53 (TP53) signaling as a potential RNF31 target. Interestingly, RNF31 decreased p53 stability, whereas depletion of RNF31 in breast cancer cells caused cell cycle arrest and cisplatin-induced apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. Furthermore, RNF31 associated with the p53/MDM2 complex and facilitated p53 polyubiquitination and degradation by stabilizing MDM2, suggesting a molecular mechanism by which RNF31 regulates cell death. Analysis of publically available clinical data sets displayed a negative correlation between RNF31 and p53 target genes, including IGFBP3 and BTG1, consistent with RNF31 regulating p53 function in vivo as well. Together, our findings suggest RNF31 as a potential therapeutic target to restore p53 function in breast cancer.Oncogene advance online publication, 6 July 2015; doi:10.1038/onc.2015.260.
26540344	Ell3 stabilizes p53 following CDDP treatment via its effects on ubiquitin-dependent and -independent proteasomal degradation pathways in breast cancer cells.	Ahn HJ, Kim KS, Shin KW, Lim KH, Kim JO, Lee JY, Kim J, Park JH, Yang KM, Baek KH, Ko JJ, Park KS.	The tumor suppressor protein p53 is unstable in quiescent cells and undergoes proteosomal degradation. Under conditions of cellular stress, p53 is rapidly stabilized by post-translational modification, thereby escaping degradation and translocating to the nucleus where it activates genes related to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Here, we report that the transcription elongation factor Ell3 sensitizes luminal type-cancer cell line, MCF7, which have wild-type p53, to the chemotherapeutic agent cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP) by stabilizing p53. Overexpression of Ell3 in MCF7 cells suppressed the MDM2-mediated ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway. In addition, Ell3 promoted binding of p53 to NADH quinone oxidoreductase 1, which is linked to the ubiquitin-independent degradation of p53. We found that Ell3 activates interleukin-20 (IL20) expression, which is linked to the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Chemical inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling or molecular suppression of IL20 revealed that the ERK1/2 signaling pathway and IL20 are the main causes of p53 stabilization in Ell3-overexpressing MCF7 cells. These findings suggest that the ERK1/2 pathway can be targeted in the rational development of therapies to induce chemosensitization of breast cancer cells.
26549060	Expression of apoptosis regulating proteins p53 and bcl-2 in psoriasis.	Moorchung N, Vasudevan B, Dinesh Kumar S, Muralidhar A.	Dysfunctional apoptosis has an important role in the development of several skin diseases. Psoriatic keratinocytes possess an enhanced ability to resist apoptosis, which might be one of the key pathogenetic mechanisms in psoriasis. P53 and bcl-2 are two proteins which control apoptosis. Several studies have evaluated the expression of these two proteins in the psoriatic skin, but the results are controversial.Fifty-eight cases of psoriatic skin biopsies were studied, and the grade of p53 and bcl-2 immunostaining was correlated with the histopathological indices of severity.Bcl-2 expression in the epidermis strongly correlated with the expression in the basal cells and lymphocytes (P - 0.001 and 0.035). There was no correlation with epidermal hyperplasia or with p53 expression in the three compartments. Bcl-2 expression in the basal layer correlated with the p53 expression in the epidermis (P - 0.027), basal layer (P - 0.015) and the lymphocytes (P - 0.034). There was a strong correlation among the p53 expression in all the compartments. There was also a weak correlation of the p53 expression in the epidermis with the epidermal hyperplasia (P - 0.042).Bcl-2 does not appear to play an important role in the apoptotic process in psoriasis. In contrast, it is likely that p53 has a far more important role to play. Mutation analysis of the p53 protein is necessary to evaluate if the protein has mutated or if it is of the wild type.
26416444	Homozygous mdm2 SNP309 cancer cells with compromised transcriptional elongation at p53 target genes are sensitive to induction of p53-independent cell death.	Rosso M, Polotskaia A, Bargonetti J.	A single nucleotide polymorphism (T to G) in the mdm2 P2 promoter, mdm2 SNP309, leads to MDM2 overexpression promoting chemotherapy resistant cancers. Two mdm2 G/G SNP309 cancer cell lines, MANCA and A875, have compromised wild-type p53 that co-localizes with MDM2 on chromatin. We hypothesized that MDM2 in these cells inhibited transcription initiation at the p53 target genes p21 and puma. Surprisingly, following etoposide treatment transcription initiation occurred at the compromised target genes in MANCA and A875 cells similar to the T/T ML-1 cell line. In all cell lines tested there was equally robust recruitment of total and initiated RNA polymerase II (Pol II). We found that knockdown of MDM2 in G/G cells moderately increased expression of subsets of p53 target genes without increasing p53 stability. Importantly, etoposide and actinomycin D treatments increased histone H3K36 trimethylation in T/T, but not G/G cells, suggesting a G/G correlated inhibition of transcription elongation. We therefore tested a chemotherapeutic agent (8-amino-adenosine) that induces p53-independent cell death for higher clinically relevant cytotoxicity. We demonstrated that T/T and G/G mdm2 SNP309 cells were equally sensitive to 8-amino-adenosine induced cell death. In conclusion for cancer cells overexpressing MDM2, targeting MDM2 may be less effective than inducing p53-independent cell death.
26205328	Reactivating mutant p53 using small molecules as zinc metallochaperones: awakening a sleeping giant in cancer.	Blanden AR, Yu X, Loh SN, Levine AJ, Carpizo DR.	Tumor protein p53 (TP53) is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer. The majority of mutations are missense, and generate a defective protein that is druggable. Yet, for decades, the small-molecule restoration of wild-type (WT) p53 function in mutant p53 tumors (so-called p53 mutant 'reactivation') has been elusive to researchers. The p53 protein requires the binding of a single zinc ion for proper folding, and impairing zinc binding is a major mechanism for loss of function in missense mutant p53. Here, we describe recent work defining a new class of drugs termed zinc metallochaperones that restore WT p53 structure and function by restoring Zn(2+) to Zn(2+)-deficient mutant p53.
25369834	p53 suppresses stress-induced cellular senescence via regulation of autophagy under the deprivation of serum.	Sui X, Fang Y, Lou H, Wang K, Zheng Y, Lou F, Jin W, Xu Y, Chen W, Pan H, Wang X, Han W.	The tumor suppressor p53 is widely known for its ability to induce cell cycle arrest or cell death, therefore preventing neoplastic progression. Previous studies have demonstrated novel roles for p53 in the regulation of autophagy and senescence. p53 can not only exert cell cycle‑arresting and senescence‑promoting or suppressing functions, but can also induce autophagic ﬂux, particularly under conditions of nutrient deprivation. The present study demonstrated that p53 was capable of activating autophagy, which permits cell survival under conditions of serum starvation, and suppresses cellular senescence through inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. These results suggest that active autophagy may be a potential mechanism by which p53 suppresses cellular senescence, in response to serum starvation. The findings of the present study provide a potential mechanism for suppression of senescence by p53.
25862488	Focal adhesion kinase and p53 synergistically decrease neuroblastoma cell survival.	Gillory LA, Stewart JE, Megison ML, Waters AM, Beierle EA.	Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood and is responsible for over 15% of pediatric cancer deaths. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that is important in many facets of neuroblastoma tumor development and progression. The p53 oncogene, although wild type in most neuroblastomas, lacks significant function as a tumor suppressor in these tumors. Recent reports have found that FAK and p53 interact in some tumor types. We have hypothesized FAK and p53 coordinately control each other's expression and also interact in neuroblastoma. In the present study, we showed that not only do FAK and p53 interact but each one controls the expression of the other. In addition, we also examined the effects of FAK inhibition combined with p53 activation in neuroblastoma and showed that these two, in combination, had a synergistic effect on neuroblastoma cell survival. The findings from this present study help to further our understanding of the regulation of neuroblastoma tumorigenesis and may provide novel therapeutic strategies and targets for neuroblastoma and other pediatric solid tumors.
25813352	The p53 Target Gene SIVA Enables Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Development.	Van Nostrand JL, Brisac A, Mello SS, Jacobs SB, Luong R, Attardi LD.	Although p53 transcriptional activation potential is critical for its ability to suppress cancer, the specific target genes involved in tumor suppression remain unclear. SIVA is a p53 target gene essential for p53-dependent apoptosis, although it can also promote proliferation through inhibition of p53 in some settings. Thus, the role of SIVA in tumorigenesis remains unclear. Here, we seek to define the contribution of SIVA to tumorigenesis by generating Siva conditional knockout mice. Surprisingly, we find that SIVA loss inhibits non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) development, suggesting that SIVA facilitates tumorigenesis. Similarly, SIVA knockdown in mouse and human NSCLC cell lines decreases proliferation and transformation. Consistent with this protumorigenic role for SIVA, high-level SIVA expression correlates with reduced NSCLC patient survival. SIVA acts independently of p53 and, instead, stimulates mTOR signaling and metabolism in NSCLC cells. Thus, SIVA enables tumorigenesis in a p53-independent manner, revealing a potential new cancer therapy target.These findings collectively reveal a novel role for the p53 target gene SIVA both in regulating metabolism and in enabling tumorigenesis, independently of p53. Importantly, these studies further identify SIVA as a new prognostic marker and as a potential target for NSCLC cancer therapy.
25603814	Growth suppression and cell death by pyridoxal is dependent on p53 in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7.	Minamino M, Oka T, Kanouchi H.	Vitamin B6 compound, pyridoxine (PN), has shown antitumor action. Our previous experiments showed that PN induces expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 to arrest proliferation and induce cell death. This induction is inhibited by the p53-specific inhibitor pifithrin-α. Here, we report that another B6 compound, pyridoxal (PL), strongly inhibited MCF-7 cell growth compared to PN. PL induced the G0/G1 arrest and the accumulation of subG1 population. Although p53 mRNA was not changed by PL, 0.5 mM PL increased the protein level in MCF-7 cells. The cell growth suppression by 0.5 mM PL did not occur when p53 expression was knocked down using siRNA. Together, these data suggest that PL accumulate p53 and PL-induced cell growth suppression is dependent on p53 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.
26599272	Glycine Decarboxylase Expression Increased in p53-Mutated B Cell Lymphoma Mice.	Li X, Cui C, Guo Y, Yang G.	p53 gene mutations are associated with human tumors, and are among the most common genetic abnormalities. To understand the relationship between p53 mutations and glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) expression in B cell lymphoma, we established B cell lymphoma animal models to study GLDC expression in B cell lymphoma mice.Based on immunohistochemical staining results, BALB/c nude mice were divided into a p53 protein-positive group and a p53 protein-negative group. GLDC mRNA expression was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and GLDC protein expression was determined by Western blot. We designed a GLDC-specific interference fragment siRNA-transfected human B cell lymphoma cell line (Raji) to establish a B cell lymphoma animal model.The results showed both GLDC mRNA and protein expression increased in the B cell lymphoma tissue of the p53 protein-positive group compared with the p53 protein-negative group. The proliferation ability of GLDC siRNA-transfected cells decreased significantly compared with the negative-control siRNA group and the blank control group (p < 0.05), which showed that the GLDC gene can promote cell proliferation in p53-mutated B cell lymphoma.These studies support a direct relationship between p53 mutations and GLDC expression in B cell lymphoma. GLDC can induce dramatic changes in glycolysis and glycine/serine metabolism, leading to changes in pyrimidine metabolism and tumor development.
26391395	AMP-activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) Control of mTORC1 Is p53- and TSC2-independent in Pemetrexed-treated Carcinoma Cells.	Agarwal S, Bell CM, Rothbart SB, Moran RG.	The key sensor of energy status in mammalian cells, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), can also be activated by the AMP analog aminoimidazolecarboxamide nucleoside monophosphate (ZMP) generated directly from aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) or from inhibition of purine synthesis by the antifolate pemetrexed (PTX), a drug used extensively in the treatment of lung cancers. Despite this common mechanism, signaling downstream of AMPK activated by PTX or AICAR differed. AICAR-activated AMPK inhibited mTORC1 both directly by phosphorylation of the mTORC1 subunit Raptor and indirectly by phosphorylation of the regulator TSC2. In contrast, PTX-activated AMPK inhibited mTORC1 solely through Raptor phosphorylation. This dichotomy was due to p53 function. Transcription of p53 target genes, including TSC2, was activated by AICAR but not by PTX. Although both PTX and AICAR stabilized p53, only AICAR activated Chk2 phosphorylation, stimulating p53-dependent transcription. However, Raptor phosphorylation by AMPK was independent of p53 and was sufficient, after PTX treatment, to inhibit mTORC1. We concluded that PTX effects on mTORC1 were independent of TSC2 and p53 and that the activation of a p53 transcriptional response by AICAR was due to an activation of Chk2 that was not elicited by PTX.
24998844	Resveratrol induces apoptosis by directly targeting Ras-GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain-binding protein 1.	Oi N, Yuan J, Malakhova M, Luo K, Li Y, Ryu J, Zhang L, Bode AM, Xu Z, Li Y, Lou Z, Dong Z.	Resveratrol (trans-3,5,4'-truhydroxystilbene) possesses a strong anticancer activity exhibited as the induction of apoptosis through p53 activation. However, the molecular mechanism and direct target(s) of resveratrol-induced p53 activation remain elusive. Here, the Ras-GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) was identified as a potential target of resveratrol, and in vitro binding assay results using resveratrol-conjugated Sepharose 4B beads confirmed their direct binding. Depletion of G3BP1 significantly diminishes resveratrol-induced p53 expression and apoptosis. We also found that G3BP1 negatively regulates p53 expression by interacting with ubiquitin-specific protease 10 (USP10), a deubiquitinating enzyme of p53. Disruption of the interaction of p53 with USP10 by G3BP1 interference leads to the suppression of p53 deubiquitination. Resveratrol, on the other hand, directly binds to G3BP1 and prevents the G3BP1/USP10 interaction, resulting in enhanced USP10-mediated deubiquitination of p53, and consequently increased p53 expression. These findings disclose a novel mechanism of resveratrol-induced p53 activation and resveratrol-induced apoptosis by direct targeting of G3BP1.
26358154	Novel p53 target genes secreted by the liver are involved in non-cell-autonomous regulation.	Charni M, Molchadsky A, Goldstein I, Solomon H, Tal P, Goldfinger N, Yang P, Porat Z, Lozano G, Rotter V.	The tumor-suppressor p53 is a transcription factor that prevents cancer development and is involved in regulation of various physiological processes. This is mediated both by induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and by controlling the expression of a plethora of target genes, including secreted proteins. It has been demonstrated that p53 may exert its effect in non-cell-autonomous manner by modulating the expression of genes that encode for secreted factors. In this study, we utilized our microarray data to identify and characterize novel p53 target genes expressed in human liver cells and associated with steroid hormones processing and transfer. We identified the steroid hormones binding factors, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) and cytochrome P450 family 21 subfamily A polypeptide 2, as novel p53 target genes. Their expression and secretion was increased following p53 activation in various hepatic cells. We observed that p53 wild-type mice exhibited higher levels of CBG compared with their p53 null counterparts. We demonstrated that the induction of the steroid hormones binding factors can be mediated by binding to specific p53 responsive elements within their promoters. In addition, utilizing conditioned medium experiments we have shown that p53-dependent induction of SHBG secretion from liver cells enhances apoptosis of breast cancer cells. Moreover, depletion of SHBG abolished the induction of breast cancer cells death. The newly identified p53 target genes suggest a novel non-cell-autonomous tumor-suppressive regulation mediated by p53 that is central for maintaining organism homeostasis.Cell Death and Differentiation advance online publication, 11 September 2015; doi:10.1038/cdd.2015.119.
25625376	Downregulation of p53 promotes in vitro perineural invasive activity of human salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma cells through epithelial-mesenchymal transition-like changes.	Yang X, Jing D, Liu L, Shen Z, Ju J, Ma C, Sun M.	Salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC) is a malignant tumor that is characterized by perineural invasion (PNI). p53 is an essential tumor-suppressor gene and p53 mutations play a critical role in tumor occurrence and progression (e.g., pancreatic, prostate and head and neck cancer). However, the regulatory role of the p53 gene in SACC and the PNI process remains unknown. In the present study, we employed RNA interference technique to downregulate p53 gene expression in SACC-83 cells to explore the role of p53 in the PNI process. Our results showed that the downregulation of the p53 gene induced significant 'epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like changes' in SACC-83 cells, including decreased expression levels of epithelial markers (E-cadherin, EMA and CK5) and increased expression levels of mesenchymal markers (vimentin, N-cadherin and C-cadherin). The downregulation of p53 also caused a lower apoptotic index of Annexin V-FITC/PI and a lower number of SACC-83 cells in the second G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Furthermore, the downregulation of the p53 gene resulted in a significant increase in PNI activity in the SACC-83 cells. Thus, our findings revealed that downregulation of p53 promoted in vitro PNI activity through 'EMT-like changes' in SACC-83 cells. The present study suggests the essential regulatory role of p53 in the PNI activity of SACC cells, and implies that p53 may be a new target gene for the clinical treatment of SACC.
25695150	Role of p53β in the inhibition of proliferation of gastric cancer cells expressing wild-type or mutated p53.	Ji W, Ma J, Zhang H, Zhong H, Li L, Ding N, Jiao J, Gao Z.	p53 is a tumor suppressor gene whose mutation is highly associated with tumorigenesis. The present study investigated the role of p53β in the inhibition of proliferation of gastric cancer cell lines expressing wild-type or mutated p53. Wild-type p53 is expressed in MKN45 cells, but deleted in KATOIII cells, whereas mutated p53 is expressed in SGC7901 cells. The mRNA expression levels of p53β and Δ133p53 were detected in MKN45, SGC-7901 and KATOIII gastric cancer cell lines using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The mRNA expression levels of p53, p53β and B-cell lymphoma 2-associated X protein (Bax) were detected in the MKN45 and SGC-7901 cells following treatment with cisplatin by reverse transcription-PCR. The inhibition of cellular proliferation following treatment with cisplatin was measured by MTT assay. The results of the present study demonstrated that both p53β and Δ133p53 mRNA were expressed in the MKN45 cells, whereas only p53β mRNA was expressed in the SGC7901 cells. No expression of p53β or Δ133p53 mRNA was detected in the KATOIII cells. Following treatment with cisplatin, the number of both MKN45 and SGC-7901 cells was significantly reduced (P<0.001). In the MKN45 cells, p53β, p53 and Bax mRNA expression levels gradually increased with the dose of cisplatin, and the expression of p53β was positively correlated with the expression of p53 (tr=6.358, P<0.05) and Bax (tr=8.023, P<0.05). In the SGC-7901 cells, the expression levels of p53β, p53 and Bax mRNA did not alter with the dose of cisplatin, and the expression of p53β was positively correlated to the expression of p53 (tr=26.41, P<0.01) but not that of Bax. The present study identified the different roles of the p53β isoform in gastric cancer cells with different p53 backgrounds. Enhanced knowledge regarding the p53 status is required for the development of specific biological therapies against gastric cancer.
25750322	Aberrant P53 expression lacks prognostic or predictive significance in colorectal cancer: results from the VICTOR trial.	McGregor MJ, Fadhil W, Wharton R, Yanagisawa Y, Presz M, Pritchard A, Womack C, Dutton S, Kerr RS, Kerr DJ, Johnstone EC, Ilyas M.	AIM: Biomarkers with prognostic and predictive value can help stratify patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) into appropriate treatment groups. We sought to evaluate the clinical utility of P53 protein expression as a biomarker in VICTOR, a large phase III trial of rofecoxib in stage II and III CRC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tissue micro arrays were constructed from 884 tumors and the expression of P53 was examined by immunohistochemistry. Tumors were dichotomised as either P53-positive (nuclear expression in >10% of cells or the 'absent' pattern, both representing TP53 mutation) or P53-negative (nuclear expression in <10% of cells). RESULTS: Aberrant P53 expression was found in 65% (482/740) of patients. It was associated with distal location (p<0.001) and stage III disease (p<0.001). No effect was observed on disease-free or overall survival, and there was no interaction with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Analysis of P53 expression in the patients recruited to the VICTOR trial confirmed that P53 expression is associated with site and stage of CRC. However, independently, this biomarker has neither prognostic nor predictive utility in this cohort of patients.
26229107	The Oncoprotein HBXIP Modulates the Feedback Loop of MDM2/p53 to Enhance the Growth of Breast Cancer.	Li H, Liu Q, Wang Z, Fang R, Shen Y, Cai X, Gao Y, Li Y, Zhang X, Ye L.	MDM2 and p53 form a negative feedback loop, in which p53 as a transcription factor positively regulates MDM2 and MDM2 negatively regulates tumor suppressor p53 through promoting its degradation. However, the mechanism of the feedback loop is poorly understood in cancers. We had reported previously that the oncoprotein hepatitis B X-interacting protein (HBXIP) is a key oncoprotein in the development of cancer. Thus, we supposed that HBXIP might be involved in the event. Here, we observed that the expression levels of HBXIP were positively correlated to those of MDM2 in clinical breast cancer tissues. Interestingly, HBXIP was able to up-regulate MDM2 at the levels of mRNA and protein in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Mechanically, HBXIP increased the promoter activities of MDM2 through directly binding to p53 in the P2 promoter of MDM2. Strikingly, we identified that the acetyltransferase p300 was recruited by HBXIP to p53 in the promoter of MDM2. Moreover, we validated that HBXIP enhanced the p53 degradation mediated by MDM2. Functionally, the knockdown of HBXIP or/and p300 inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro, and the depletion of MDM2 or overexpression of p53 significantly blocked the HBXIP-promoted growth of breast cancer in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we concluded that highly expressed HBXIP accelerates the MDM2-mediated degradation of p53 in breast cancer through modulating the feedback loop of MDM2/p53, resulting in the fast growth of breast cancer cells. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism of the acceleration of the MDM2/p53 feedback loop in the development of cancer.
26433123	p53-dependent and p53-independent anticancer activity of a new indole derivative in human osteosarcoma cells.	Cappadone C, Stefanelli C, Malucelli E, Zini M, Onofrillo C, Locatelli A, Rambaldi M, Sargenti A, Merolle L, Farruggia G, Graziadio A, Montanaro L, Iotti S.	Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary malignant tumor of bone, occurring most frequently in children and adolescents. The mechanism of formation and development of OS have been studied for a long time. Tumor suppressor pathway governed by p53 gene are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma. Moreover, loss of wild-type p53 activity is thought to be a major predictor of failure to respond to chemotherapy in various human cancers. In previous studies, we described the activity of a new indole derivative, NSC743420, belonging to the tubulin inhibitors family, capable to induce apoptosis and arrest of the cell cycle in the G2/M phase of various cancer cell lines. However, this molecule has never been tested on OS cell line. Here we address the activity of NSC743420 by examine whether differences in the p53 status could influence its effects on cell proliferation and death of OS cells. In particular, we compared the effect of the tested molecule on p53-wild type and p53-silenced U2OS cells, and on SaOS2 cell line, which is null for p53. Our results demonstrated that NSC743420 reduces OS cell proliferation by p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms. In particular, the molecule induces proliferative arrest that culminate to apoptosis in SaOS2 p53-null cells, while it brings a cytostatic and differentiating effect in U2OS cells, characterized by the cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase and increased alkaline phosphatase activity.
26434996	Dual regulation of energy metabolism by p53 in human cervix and breast cancer cells.	Hernández-Reséndiz I, Román-Rosales A, García-Villa E, López-Macay A, Pineda E, Saavedra E, Gallardo-Pérez JC, Alvarez-Ríos E, Gariglio P, Moreno-Sánchez R, Rodríguez-Enríquez S.	The role of p53 as modulator of OxPhos and glycolysis was analyzed in HeLa-L (cells containing negligible p53 protein levels) and HeLa-H (p53-overexpressing) human cervix cancer cells under normoxia and hypoxia. In normoxia, functional p53, mitochondrial enzyme contents, mitochondrial electrical potential (ΔΨm) and OxPhos flux increased in HeLa-H vs. HeLa-L cells; whereas their glycolytic enzyme contents and glycolysis flux were unchanged. OxPhos provided more than 70% of the cellular ATP and proliferation was abolished by anti-mitochondrial drugs in HeLa-H cells. In hypoxia, both cell proliferations were suppressed, but HeLa-H cells exhibited a significant decrease in OxPhos protein contents, ΔΨm and OxPhos flux. Although glycolytic function was also diminished vs. HeLa-L cells in hypoxia, glycolysis provided more than 60% of cellular ATP in HeLa-H cells. The energy metabolism phenotype of HeLa-H cells was reverted to that of HeLa-L cells by incubating with pifithrin-α, a p53-inhibitor. In normoxia, the energy metabolism phenotype of breast cancer MCF-7 cells was similar to that of HeLa-H cells, whereas p53shRNAMCF-7 cells resembled the HeLa-L cell phenotype. In hypoxia, autophagy proteins and lysosomes contents increased 2-5 times in HeLa-H cells suggesting mitophagy activation. These results indicated that under normoxia p53 up-regulated OxPhos without affecting glycolysis, whereas under hypoxia, p53 down-regulated both OxPhos (severely) and glycolysis (weakly). These p53 effects appeared mediated by the formation of p53-HIF-1α complexes. Therefore, p53 exerts a dual and contrasting regulatory role on cancer energy metabolism, depending on the O2 level.
25827071	All-trans retinoic acid induces p53-depenent apoptosis in human hepatocytes by activating p14 expression via promoter hypomethylation.	Heo SH, Kwak J, Jang KL.	All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), the most biologically active metabolite of vitamin A, has been extensively studied for the prevention and treatment of cancer; however, the underlying mechanism of its anti-cancer potential is still unclear. Here we found that ATRA induces apoptosis in p53-positive HepG2 cells, but not in p53-negative Hep3B cells. For this effect, ATRA activated p14 expression via promoter hypomethylation, resulting in ubiquitin-dependent degradation of mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) and subsequent stabilization of p53. The potential of ATRA to stabilize p53 was almost completely abolished by knock-down of p14 in HepG2 cells and was not observed in p14-negative A549 cells. Upregulation of p14 also abolished the self-regulatory potential of p53 to repress p14 expression via DNA methylation and transcriptionally activate MDM2 expression. The accumulated p53 then activated several apoptosis-related molecules, including Bax, PUMA, caspase-9, Bid, caspase-8, caspase-3, and PARP. Ectopic expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 almost completely abolished the potential of ATRA to activate the p14-MDM2-p53 pathway and induce p53-dependent apoptosis. Therefore, we conclude that ATRA induces p14 promoter hypomethylation to trigger apoptosis.
26264138	Overexpression of yeast thioredoxin TRX2 reduces p53-mediated cell death in yeast.	Kamoun Y, Mabrouk I, Delahodde A, Boukid F, Yacoubi-Hadj Amor I, Mokdad-Gargouri R, Gargouri A.	We have previously shown that overexpression of the human tumor suppressor protein P53 causes cell death of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. P53 overproduction led to transcriptional downregulation of some yeast genes, such as the TRX1/2 thioredoxin system, which plays a key role in cell protection against various oxidative stresses induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the present work, the impact of TRX2 overexpression on apoptosis mediated by p53 overexpression in yeast is investigated. In yeast cells expressing P53 under an inducible promoter together with TRX2 under a strong constitutive promoter, we showed that Tr2p overproduction reduced the apoptotic effect exerted by P53 and increased the viability of the P53-overproducing cells. Furthermore, measurements of ROS amounts by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy indicated that the TRX2 protein acted probably through its increased detoxifying activity on the P53-generated ROS. The steady-state level and activity of P53 were not affected by TRX2 overexpression, as shown by western blotting and functional analysis of separated alleles in yeast (FASAY), respectively. The growth inhibitory effect of P53 was partially reversed by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. Our data strengthen the idea that overexpression of a single gene (trx2) decreases the p53-mediated cell death by decreasing ROS accumulation.
25961923	MDM4/HIPK2/p53 cytoplasmic assembly uncovers coordinated repression of molecules with anti-apoptotic activity during early DNA damage response.	Mancini F, Pieroni L, Monteleone V, Lucà R, Fici L, Luca E, Urbani A, Xiong S, Soddu S, Masetti R, Lozano G, Pontecorvi A, Moretti F.	The p53 inhibitor, MDM4 (MDMX) is a cytoplasmic protein with p53-activating function under DNA damage conditions. Particularly, MDM4 promotes phosphorylation of p53 at Ser46, a modification that precedes different p53 activities. We investigated the mechanism by which MDM4 promotes this p53 modification and its consequences in untransformed mammary epithelial cells and tissues. In response to severe DNA damage, MDM4 stimulates p53Ser46(P) by binding and stabilizing serine-threonine kinase HIPK2. Under these conditions, the p53-inhibitory complex, MDM4/MDM2, dissociates and this allows MDM4 to promote p53/HIPK2 functional interaction. Comparative proteomic analysis of DNA damage-treated cells versus -untreated cells evidenced a diffuse downregulation of proteins with anti-apoptotic activity, some of which were targets of p53Ser46(P)/HIPK2 repressive activity. Importantly, MDM4 depletion abolishes the downregulation of these proteins indicating the requirement of MDM4 to promote p53-mediated transcriptional repression. Consistently, MDM4-mediated HIPK2/p53 activation precedes HIPK2/p53 nuclear translocation and activity. Noteworthy, repression of these proteins was evident also in mammary glands of mice subjected to γ-irradiation and was significantly enhanced in transgenic mice overexpressing MDM4. This study evidences the flexibility of MDM2/MDM4 heterodimer, which allows the development of a positive activity of cytoplasmic MDM4 towards p53-mediated transcriptional function. Noteworthy, this activity uncovers coordinated repression of molecules with shared anti-apoptotic function which precedes active cell apoptosis and that are frequently overexpressed and/or markers of tumour phenotype in human cancer.Oncogene advance online publication, 11 May 2015; doi:10.1038/onc.2015.76.
26032169	Genistein induces apoptosis by stabilizing intracellular p53 protein through an APE1-mediated pathway.	Zhu J, Zhang C, Qing Y, Cheng Y, Jiang X, Li M, Yang Z, Wang D.	Genistein (GEN) has been previously shown to have a proapoptotic effect on cancer cells through a p53-dependent pathway, the mechanism of which remains unclear. One of its intracellular targets, APE1, protects against apoptosis under genotoxic stress and interacts with p53. In this current study, we explored the mechanism of the proapoptotic effect of GEN by examining the APE1-p53 protein-protein interaction. We initially showed that the p53 protein level was elevated in GEN-treated human non-small lung cancer A549 cells and cervical cancer HeLa cells. By examining both protein synthesis and degradation, we found that GEN enhances p53 intracellular stability by interfering with the interaction of APE1 and p53, which provided a plausible explanation for how GEN initiates apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that the interaction between APE1 and p53 is important for the degradation of p53 and is dependent on the redox domain of APE1 by utilizing the redox domain mutant APE1 C65A. Our data suggest that the degradation of wild-type p53 is blocked when the redox domain of APE1 is masked or interrupted. Based on this evidence, we hereby report a novel mechanism of p53 degradation through an APE1-mediated, redox-dependent pathway.
25961931	Direct relationship between the level of p53 stabilization induced by rRNA synthesis-inhibiting drugs and the cell ribosome biogenesis rate.	Scala F, Brighenti E, Govoni M, Imbrogno E, Fornari F, Treré D, Montanaro L, Derenzini M.	Many drugs currently used in chemotherapy work by hindering the process of ribosome biogenesis. In tumors with functional p53, the inhibition of ribosome biogenesis may contribute to the efficacy of this treatment by inducing p53 stabilization. As the level of stabilized p53 is critical for the induction of cytotoxic effects, it seems useful to highlight those cancer cell characteristics that can predict the degree of p53 stabilization following the treatment with inhibitors of ribosome biogenesis. In the present study we exposed a series of p53 wild-type human cancer cell lines to drugs such as actinomycin D (ActD), doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil and CX-5461, which hinder ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis. We found that the amount of stabilized p53 was directly related to the level of ribosome biogenesis in cells before the drug treatment. This was due to different levels of inactivation of the ribosomal proteins-MDM2 pathway of p53 digestion. Inhibition of rRNA synthesis always caused cell cycle arrest, independent of the ribosome biogenesis rate of the cells, whereas apoptosis occurred only in cells with a high rDNA transcription rate. The level of p53 stabilization induced by drugs acting in different ways from the inhibition of ribosome biogenesis, such as hydroxyurea (HU) and nutlin-3, was independent of the level of ribosome biogenesis in cells and always lower than that occurring after the inhibition of rRNA synthesis. Interestingly, in cells with a low ribosome biogenesis rate, the combined treatment with ActD and HU exerted an additive effect on p53 stabilization. These results indicated that (i) drugs inhibiting ribosome biogenesis may be highly effective in p53 wild-type cancers with a high ribosome biogenesis rate, as they induce apoptotic cell death, and (ii) the combination of drugs capable of stabilizing p53 through different mechanisms may be useful for treating cancers with a low ribosome biogenesis rate.Oncogene advance online publication, 11 May 2015; doi:10.1038/onc.2015.147.
26146058	[ASPP2 inhibits oxaliplatin-induced autophagy and promotes apoptosis of colon cancer cells].	Wang B, Qiao L, Shi Y, Feng X, Chen D, Guo H.	To investigate the role of apoptosis stimulating p53 binding protein 2 (ASPP2)-induced p53-dependent and p53-independent autophagy inhibition in apoptosis-promoting function of oxaliplatin (OXA).According to different treatments, HCT116(p53(-/-)) cells were divided into 6 groups: rapamycin combined with ASPP2 group, ASPP2 group, p53 group, ASPP2 combined with p53 group, OXA combined with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) group, control group (OXA treatment or starvation without OXA treatment). When the level of apoptosis was detected, green fluorescent protein-advirus (GFP-Ad) group and rapamycin group were supplemented as controls. Cells were transfected with GFP-microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (GFP-LC3) plasmid, and LC3-expressing cells were calculated under a fluorescent microscope. Expressions of autophagy-related molecules were detected by Western blotting. Cells were subjected to annexin V-FITC/PI staining and apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry.The 3-MA group showed the same inhibitory ability on autophagy with the ASPP2 group, and both of them were able to promote OXA or starvation-induced apoptosis, but the cell apoptosis rate in the 3-MA group was lower than that of the ASPP2 group. Rapamycin combined with ASPP2 still promoted OXA or starvation-induced apoptosis, and the apoptosis rate was also lower than that of the ASPP2 group. However, rapamycin counteracted effectively the inhibitory effect of ASPP2 on autophagy.OXA can induce autophagy of colorectal cancer cells, while ASPP2 over-expression can suppress the OXA-induced autophagy. ASPP2 can promote apoptosis through p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways. The function of ASPP2 promoting cell apoptosis through p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways is not entirely achieved by inhibiting cell autophagy.
24469037	Structural proteins of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus antagonize p53-mediated apoptosis.	Chudasama P, Konrad A, Jochmann R, Lausen B, Holz P, Naschberger E, Neipel F, Britzen-Laurent N, Stürzl M.	The tumor suppressor p53 is a central regulatory molecule of apoptosis and is commonly mutated in tumors. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-related malignancies express wild-type p53. Accordingly, KSHV encodes proteins that counteract the cell death-inducing effects of p53. Here, the effects of all KSHV genes on the p53 signaling pathway were systematically analyzed using the reversely transfected cell microarray technology. With this approach we detected eight KSHV-encoded genes with potent p53 inhibiting activity in addition to the previously described inhibitory effects of KSHV genes ORF50, K10 and K10.5. Interestingly, the three most potent newly identified inhibitors were KSHV structural proteins, namely ORF22 (glycoprotein H), ORF25 (major capsid protein) and ORF64 (tegument protein). Validation of these results with a classical transfection approach showed that these proteins inhibited p53 signaling in a dose-dependent manner and that this effect could be reversed by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of the respective viral gene. All three genes inhibited p53-mediated apoptosis in response to Nutlin-3 treatment in non-infected and KSHV-infected cells. Addressing putative mechanisms, we could show that these proteins could also inhibit the transactivation of the promoters of apoptotic mediators of p53 such as BAX and PIG3. Altogether, we demonstrate for the first time that structural proteins of KSHV can counteract p53-induced apoptosis. These proteins are expressed in the late lytic phase of the viral life cycle and are incorporated into the KSHV virion. Accordingly, these genes may inhibit cell death in the productive and in the early entrance phase of KSHV infection.
25311224	Lack of functional p53 renders DENSpm-induced autophagy and apoptosis in time dependent manner in colon cancer cells.	Çoker-Gürkan A, Arisan ED, Obakan P, Palavan-Unsal N.	Polyamines (PAs), such as putrescine, spermidine and spermine, are alkyl-amines that are essential for cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and cancer progression in eukaryotic cells. A designed PA analogue; DENSpm, induces cell cycle arrest, inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in melanoma, breast, prostate, lung and colon cancer cells. Although the mechanism by which DENSpm induces apoptosis has been examined, the effect of DENSpm on autophagy has not been investigated yet. Therefore, in this study, our objective was to determine the role of p53 in the DENSpm-induced autophagy/apoptotic regulation in a time-dependent manner in colon cancer cells. Exposure of HCT 116 colon cancer cells to DENSpm decreased cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. However, the p53 mutant, SW480, and deficient HCT 116 p53(-/-) cells were more resistant to DENSpm treatment compared to HCT 116 p53(+/+) cells. The resistant profile caused by p53 defect also caused a cell type-specific response to PA pool depletion and SSAT overexpression. In addition to PA depletion, DENSpm induced apoptosis by activating the mitochondria-mediated pathway in a caspase-dependent manner regardless of p53 expression in colon cancer cells. Concomitantly, we determined that DENSpm also affected autophagy in HCT 116 p53(+/+), SW480 and HCT 116 p53(-/-) colon cancer cells for different periods of exposure to DENSpm. Therefore, this study revealed that effect of DENSpm on cell death differs due to p53 protein expression profile. In addition, DENSpm-induced autophagy may be critical in drug resistance in colon cancer cells.
25742798	Augmented BMP signaling in the neural crest inhibits nasal cartilage morphogenesis by inducing p53-mediated apoptosis.	Hayano S, Komatsu Y, Pan H, Mishina Y.	Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling plays many roles in skull morphogenesis. We have previously reported that enhanced BMP signaling through the BMP type IA receptor (BMPR1A) in cranial neural crest cells causes craniosynostosis during postnatal development. Additionally, we observed that 55% of Bmpr1a mutant mice show neonatal lethality characterized by a distended gastrointestinal tract. Here, we show that severely affected mutants exhibit defective nasal cartilage, failure of fusion between the nasal septum and the secondary palate, and higher levels of phosphorylated SMAD1 and SMAD5 in the nasal tissue. TUNEL demonstrated an increase in apoptosis in both condensing mesenchymal tissues and cartilage of the nasal region in mutants. The levels of p53 (TRP53) tumor suppressor protein were also increased in the same tissue. Injection of pifithrin-α, a chemical inhibitor of p53, into pregnant mice prevented neonatal lethality while concomitantly reducing apoptosis in nasal cartilage primordia, suggesting that enhanced BMP signaling induces p53-mediated apoptosis in the nasal cartilage. The expression of Bax and caspase 3, downstream targets of p53, was increased in the mutants; however, the p53 expression level was unchanged. It has been reported that MDM2 interacts with p53 to promote degradation. We found that the amount of MDM2-p53 complex was decreased in all mutants, and the most severely affected mutants had the largest decrease. Our previous finding that the BMP signaling component SMAD1 prevents MDM2-mediated p53 degradation coupled with our new data indicate that augmented BMP signaling induces p53-mediated apoptosis by prevention of p53 degradation in developing nasal cartilage. Thus, an appropriate level of BMP signaling is required for proper craniofacial morphogenesis.
25431847	Electrical stimulation enhances epidermal proliferation in human cutaneous wounds by modulating p53-SIVA1 interaction.	Sebastian A, Iqbal SA, Colthurst J, Volk SW, Bayat A.	Cutaneous wounds establish endogenous "wound current" upon injury until re-epithelialization is complete. Keratinocyte proliferation, regulated partly by p53, is required for epidermal closure. SIVA1 promotes human double minute 2 homolog (HDM2)-mediated p53 regulation. However, the role of SIVA1 in wound healing is obscure. Here, we report that electrical stimulation (ES) accelerates wound healing by upregulating SIVA1 and its subsequent ability to modulate p53 activities. Cultured donut-shaped human skin explants, subjected to ES, exhibited better epidermal stratification, increased proliferation, and upregulation of gene and protein expression of HDM2/SIVA1, compared with non-ES-treated explants. ES significantly increased in vitro keratinocyte proliferation and phospho-p53-SIVA1 interaction; however, this showed stable expression of phospho-p53, which increased significantly in the absence of SIVA1. Here, HDM2 alone was unable to downregulate nuclear-accumulated phospho-p53, which was evident from decreased proliferation and increased sub-G1 population seen by flow cytometry. Further examination of the epidermis of human cutaneous wounds showed higher p53-SIVA1 coexpression and proliferation 7 days after injury in ES-treated wounds compared with control wounds. In summary, ES-inducible SIVA1 modulates p53 activities in proliferating keratinocytes, and exogenous ES affects p53/HDM2/SIVA1 axis leading to increased proliferation during re-epithelialization. This highlights ES as a potential strategy for enhancing cutaneous repair.
25466965	PBK/TOPK expression correlates with mutant p53 and affects patients' prognosis and cell proliferation and viability in lung adenocarcinoma.	Lei B, Qi W, Zhao Y, Li Y, Liu S, Xu X, Zhi C, Wan L, Shen H.	The PDZ-binding kinase/T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase (PBK/TOPK) is highly expressed in many types of tumors. However, its role in lung adenocarcinoma remains elusive. The aims of this study were to investigate the correlation between PBK/TOPK and mutant p53 in lung adenocarcinoma and to evaluate the effect of PBK/TOPK on cell proliferation and viability. Expression of PBK/TOPK and mutant p53 was detected in 127 cases of lung adenocarcinoma and was examined in the A549, GLC-82, and H358 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines by immunohistochemistry staining and Western blot assay. When PBK/TOPK expression was down-regulated by TOPK-specific siRNA in the A549 and GLC-82 lines, the effects of PBK/TOPK on cell proliferation, viability, and mutant p53 expression were evaluated. Expression of PBK/TOPK correlated positively with mutant p53 in both tumor tissues and cell lines. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that PBK/TOPK, mutant p53, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, high TNM stage, and poor tumor differentiation were associated with a poor prognosis. Cox multivariate analysis showed that PBK/TOPK, mutant p53, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis could each serve as an independent prognostic factor. After down-regulation of PBK/TOPK in the A549 and GLC-82 cell lines, mutant p53 expression was decreased, and cell proliferation and viability were significantly inhibited. Therefore, our results suggest that PBK/TOPK correlates with mutant p53 and affects cell proliferation and viability as well as prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma.
24893067	Overexpression of p53 in the endometrial gland in postmenopausal women.	Koi C, Hachisuga T, Murakami M, Kurita T, Nguyen TT, Shimajiri S, Fujino Y.	OBJECTIVE: The p53 signature, which (although morphologically unremarkable) displays diffuse and strong p53 nuclear staining, has been proposed to be a precursor of serous endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma. We examined the overexpression of p53 in postmenopausal endometrial glands. METHODS: Postmenopausal endometrial tissues of 82 women with benign disease, including 10 hormone users, were evaluated in this study. Tissues with endometrial hyperplasia and/or polyps were excluded based on a histopathologic review. Expressions of estrogen receptor-α, Ki-67, and p53 were immunohistochemically examined. Apoptotic cells were identified using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay. Overexpression of p53 was categorized as moderate to strong in more than 50% of glandular cell nuclei. RESULTS: Focal glandular overexpression of p53 was observed in 1 (9%) of 10 and in 8 (11%) of 72 postmenopausal endometrial tissue specimens in women with and women without a history of hormone use, respectively. Among nonhormone users, the median Ki-67 and apoptotic indices in the postmenopausal endometrial glands of women with and women without overexpression of p53 were 16% and 6% (P = 0.007) and 1% and 1% (P = 0.345), respectively. All postmenopausal endometrial glands were positive for estrogen receptor-α, regardless of the overexpression of p53. The postmenopausal endometrial glands of estrogen users exhibited significantly higher Ki-67 and apoptotic indices than those of nonestrogen users (P = 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of p53 may be responsible for the high proliferative activity of postmenopausal endometrial glandular cells associated with conditions of low apoptotic cell death.
25753752	Characterization of the p300 Taz2-p53 TAD2 complex and comparison with the p300 Taz2-p53 TAD1 complex.	Miller Jenkins LM, Feng H, Durell SR, Tagad HD, Mazur SJ, Tropea JE, Bai Y, Appella E.	The p53 tumor suppressor is a critical mediator of the cellular response to stress. The N-terminal transactivation domain of p53 makes protein interactions that promote its function as a transcription factor. Among those cofactors is the histone acetyltransferase p300, which both stabilizes p53 and promotes local chromatin unwinding. Here, we report the nuclear magnetic resonance solution structure of the Taz2 domain of p300 bound to the second transactivation subdomain of p53. In the complex, p53 forms an α-helix between residues 47 and 55 that interacts with the α1-α2-α3 face of Taz2. Mutational analysis indicated several residues in both p53 and Taz2 that are critical for stabilizing the interaction. Finally, further characterization of the complex by isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that complex formation is pH-dependent and releases a bound chloride ion. This study highlights differences in the structures of complexes formed by the two transactivation subdomains of p53 that may be broadly observed and play critical roles in p53 transcriptional activity.
26343999	Tumour suppressor protein p53 regulates the stress activated bilirubin oxidase cytochrome P450 2A6.	Hu H, Yu T, Arpiainen S, Lang MA, Hakkola J, Abu-Bakar A.	Human cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2A6 enzyme has been proposed to play a role in cellular defence against chemical-induced oxidative stress. The encoding gene is regulated by various stress activated transcription factors. This paper demonstrates that p53 is a novel transcriptional regulator of the gene. Sequence analysis of the CYP2A6 promoter revealed six putative p53 binding sites in a 3kb proximate promoter region. The site closest to transcription start site (TSS) is highly homologous with the p53 consensus sequence. Transfection with various stepwise deletions of CYP2A6-5'-Luc constructs - down to -160bp from the TSS - showed p53 responsiveness in p53 overexpressed C3A cells. However, a further deletion from -160 to -74bp, including the putative p53 binding site, totally abolished the p53 responsiveness. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay with a probe containing the putative binding site showed specific binding of p53. A point mutation at the binding site abolished both the binding and responsiveness of the recombinant gene to p53. Up-regulation of the endogenous p53 with benzo[α]pyrene - a well-known p53 activator - increased the expression of the p53 responsive positive control and the CYP2A6-5'-Luc construct containing the intact p53 binding site but not the mutated CYP2A6-5'-Luc construct. Finally, inducibility of the native CYP2A6 gene by benzo[α]pyrene was demonstrated by dose-dependent increases in CYP2A6 mRNA and protein levels along with increased p53 levels in the nucleus. Collectively, the results indicate that p53 protein is a regulator of the CYP2A6 gene in C3A cells and further support the putative cytoprotective role of CYP2A6.
25995247	FUSE Binding Protein 1 Facilitates Persistent Hepatitis C Virus Replication in Hepatoma Cells by Regulating Tumor Suppressor p53.	Dixit U, Pandey AK, Liu Z, Kumar S, Neiditch MB, Klein KM, Pandey VN.	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a leading cause of chronic hepatitis C (CHC), liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Immunohistochemistry of archived HCC tumors showed abundant FBP1 expression in HCC tumors with the CHC background. Oncomine data analysis of normal versus HCC tumors with the CHC background indicated a 4-fold increase in FBP1 expression with a concomitant 2.5-fold decrease in the expression of p53. We found that FBP1 promotes HCV replication by inhibiting p53 and regulating BCCIP and TCTP, which are positive and negative regulators of p53, respectively. The severe inhibition of HCV replication in FBP1-knockdown Huh7.5 cells was restored to a normal level by downregulation of either p53 or BCCIP. Although p53 in Huh7.5 cells is transcriptionally inactive as a result of Y220C mutation, we found that the activation and DNA binding ability of Y220C p53 were strongly suppressed by FBP1 but significantly activated upon knockdown of FBP1. Transient expression of FBP1 in FBP1 knockdown cells fully restored the control phenotype in which the DNA binding ability of p53 was strongly suppressed. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we found no significant difference in in vitro target DNA binding affinity of recombinant wild-type p53 and its Y220C mutant p53. However, in the presence of recombinant FBP1, the DNA binding ability of p53 is strongly inhibited. We confirmed that FBP1 downregulates BCCIP, p21, and p53 and upregulates TCTP under radiation-induced stress. Since FBP1 is overexpressed in most HCC tumors with an HCV background, it may have a role in promoting persistent virus infection and tumorigenesis.It is our novel finding that FUSE binding protein 1 (FBP1) strongly inhibits the function of tumor suppressor p53 and is an essential host cell factor required for HCV replication. Oncomine data analysis of a large number of samples has revealed that overexpression of FBP1 in most HCC tumors with chronic hepatitis C is significantly linked with the decreased expression level of p53. The most significant finding is that FBP1 not only physically interacts with p53 and interferes with its binding to the target DNA but also functions as a negative regulator of p53 under cellular stress. FBP1 is barely detectable in normal differentiated cells; its overexpression in HCC tumors with the CHC background suggests that FBP1 has an important role in promoting HCV infection and HCC tumors by suppressing p53.
26447864	Exclusive Association of p53 Mutation with Super-High Methylation of Tumor Suppressor Genes in the p53 Pathway in a Unique Gastric Cancer Phenotype.	Waraya M, Yamashita K, Ema A, Katada N, Kikuchi S, Watanabe M.	A comprehensive search for DNA methylated genes identified candidate tumor suppressor genes that have been proven to be involved in the apoptotic process of the p53 pathway. In this study, we investigated p53 mutation in relation to such epigenetic alteration in primary gastric cancer.The methylation profiles of the 3 genes: PGP9.5, NMDAR2B, and CCNA1, which are involved in the p53 tumor suppressor pathway in combination with p53 mutation were examined in 163 primary gastric cancers. The effect of epigenetic reversion in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs on apoptosis was also assessed according to the tumor p53 mutation status.p53 gene mutations were found in 44 primary gastric tumors (27%), and super-high methylation of any of the 3 genes was only found in cases with wild type p53. Higher p53 pathway aberration was found in cases with male gender (p = 0.003), intestinal type (p = 0.005), and non-infiltrating type (p = 0.001). The p53 pathway aberration group exhibited less recurrence in lymph nodes, distant organs, and peritoneum than the p53 non-aberration group. In the NUGC4 gastric cancer cell line (p53 wild type), epigenetic treatment augmented apoptosis by chemotherapeutic drugs, partially through p53 transcription activity. On the other hand, in the KATO III cancer cell line (p53 mutant), epigenetic treatment alone induced robust apoptosis, with no trans-activation of p53.In gastric cancer, p53 relevant and non-relevant pathways exist, and tumors with either pathway type exhibited unique clinical features. Epigenetic treatments can induce apoptosis partially through p53 activation, however their apoptotic effects may be explained largely by mechanism other than through p53 pathways.
25446071	Impact of cadmium, cobalt and nickel on sequence-specific DNA binding of p63 and p73 in vitro and in cells.	Adámik M, Bažantová P, Navrátilová L, Polášková A, Pečinka P, Holaňová L, Tichý V, Brázdová M.	Site-specific DNA recognition and binding activity belong to common attributes of all three members of tumor suppressor p53 family proteins: p53, p63 and p73. It was previously shown that heavy metals can affect p53 conformation, sequence-specific binding and suppress p53 response to DNA damage. Here we report for the first time that cadmium, nickel and cobalt, which have already been shown to disturb various DNA repair mechanisms, can also influence p63 and p73 sequence-specific DNA binding activity and transactivation of p53 family target genes. Based on results of electrophoretic mobility shift assay and luciferase reporter assay, we conclude that cadmium inhibits sequence-specific binding of all three core domains to p53 consensus sequences and abolishes transactivation of several promoters (e.g. BAX and MDM2) by 50μM concentrations. In the presence of specific DNA, all p53 family core domains were partially protected against loss of DNA binding activity due to cadmium treatment. Effective cadmium concentration to abolish DNA-protein interactions was about two times higher for p63 and p73 proteins than for p53. Furthermore, we detected partial reversibility of cadmium inhibition for all p53 family members by EDTA. DTT was able to reverse cadmium inhibition only for p53 and p73. Nickel and cobalt abolished DNA-p53 interaction at sub-millimolar concentrations while inhibition of p63 and p73 DNA binding was observed at millimolar concentrations. In summary, cadmium strongly inhibits p53, p63 and p73 DNA binding in vitro and in cells in comparison to nickel and cobalt. The role of cadmium inhibition of p53 tumor suppressor family in carcinogenesis is discussed.
25574723	p53 expression in oral lichenoid lesions and oral lichen planus.	Arreaza A, Rivera H, Correnti M.	The aim of this article was to compare the expression of p53 protein in oral lichen planus (OLP) and oral lichenoid reaction (OLR). The study population consisted of 65 patients--31 diagnosed with OLP and 34 with OLR. The results showed more p53 positive cases in the OLP group than in the OLR group. However, the difference between the 2 groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.114). The most common immunolocalization was observed at the basal cell layer. Due to the chance of potential future malignancy, follow-up for all cases is recommended.
25636497	Role of p53 in the progression from ochratoxin A-induced DNA damage to gene mutations in the kidneys of mice.	Kuroda K, Hibi D, Ishii Y, Yokoo Y, Takasu S, Kijima A, Matsushita K, Masumura K, Kodama Y, Yanai T, Sakai H, Nohmi T, Ogawa K, Umemura T.	Carcinogenic doses of ochratoxin A (OTA) cause increases of mutant frequencies (MFs) of the red/gam gene (Spi(-)) in the kidneys of p53-deficient gpt delta mice, but not in p53-proficient mice. Here, we investigated the role of p53 in the progression from OTA-induced DNA damage to gene mutations. To this end, p53-proficient and -deficient mice were administered 5 mg/kg OTA for 3 days or 4 weeks by gavage. After 3 days of administration, comet assays were performed and there were no differences in the degrees of OTA-induced DNA damage between p53-proficient and -deficient mice. However, the frequencies of γ-H2AX-positive tubular epithelial cells in p53-deficient mice were significantly higher than those in p53-proficient mice, implying that p53 inhibited the progression from DNA damage to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Evaluation of global gene expression and relevant mRNA/protein expression levels demonstrated that OTA increased the expression of Cdkn1a, which encodes the p21 protein, in p53-proficient mice, but not in p53-deficient mice. Moreover, in p53-deficient mice, mRNA levels of cell cycle progression and DSB repair (homologous recombination repair [HR])-related genes were significantly increased. Thus, G1/S arrest due to activation of the p53/p21 pathway may contribute to the prevention of DSBs in p53-proficient mice. In addition, single base deletions/insertions/substitutions were predominant, possibly due to HR. Overall, these results suggested that OTA induced DSBs at the carcinogenic target site in mice and that p53/p21-mediated cell cycle control prevented an increase in the formation of DSBs, leading to gene mutations.
25911104	Tumor-suppressive p53 Signaling Empowers Metastatic Inhibitor KLF17-dependent Transcription to Overcome Tumorigenesis in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.	Ali A, Bhatti MZ, Shah AS, Duong HQ, Alkreathy HM, Mohammad SF, Khan RA, Ahmad A.	Metastasis, which is controlled by concerted action of multiple genes, is a complex process and is an important cause of cancer death. Krüppel-like factor 17 (KLF17) is a negative regulator of metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) during cancer progression. However, the underlying molecular mechanism and biological relevance of KLF17 in cancer cells are poorly understood. Here, we show that tumor suppressor protein p53 plays an integral role to induce KLF17 expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). p53 is recruited to the KLF17 promoter and results in the formation of p53-DNA complex. p53 enhances binding of p300 and favors histone acetylation on the KLF17 promoter. Mechanistically, p53 physically interacts with KLF17 and thereby enhances the anti-metastatic function of KLF17. p53 empowers KLF17-mediated EMT genes transcription via enhancing physical association of KLF17 with target gene promoters. Nutlin-3 recruits KLF17 to EMT target gene promoters and results in the formation of KLF17-DNA complex via a p53-dependent pathway. p53 depletion abrogates DNA binding affinity of KLF17 to EMT target gene promoters. KLF17 is critical for p53 cellular activities in NSCLC. Importantly, KLF17 enhances p53 transcription to generate a novel positive feedback loop. KLF17 depletion accelerates lung cancer cell growth in response to chemotherapy. Mechanistically, we found that KLF17 increases the expression of tumor suppressor genes p53, p21, and pRB. Functionally, KLF17 required p53 to suppress cancer cell invasion and migration in NSCLC. In conclusion, our study highlights a novel insight into the anti-EMT effect of KLF17 via a p53-dependent pathway in NSCLC, and KLF17 may be a new therapeutic target in NSCLC with p53 status.
26171916	Combined Immunohistochemistry of PLK1, p21, and p53 for Predicting TP53 Status: An Independent Prognostic Factor of Breast Cancer.	Watanabe G, Ishida T, Furuta A, Takahashi S, Watanabe M, Nakata H, Kato S, Ishioka C, Ohuchi N.	It is difficult to predict the TP53 status by p53 immunohistochemistry (IHC). We aimed to improve the accuracy of p53 IHC with p53-regulated proteins for predicting the TP53 mutation status. TP53 mutations were detected in 19 of 38 breast cancer patients (50%). Five of 7 cases of protein-truncating mutation of TP53 were completely negative for p53 IHC, whereas 11 of 12 cases of TP53 point mutation were strongly positive for p53 IHC. Therefore, to avoid false negatives, we extracted p53-dependent universally downregulated genes using microarray analysis from 38 breast cancer patients and 2 p53-inducible cell lines. From 9 commonly repressed genes, we evaluated 3 genes, baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 5 (BIRC5), polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), and BUB1 mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine kinase (BUB1), which were previously identified as p53-dependent repressed genes. PLK1≥Allred total score (TS) 5 showed the highest correlation with TP53 mutation. To decrease false positivity, we evaluated p21 IHC. Although strong staining of p21 was observed in 4 cases (10.5%), all 4 were wild-type TP53. Thus, p53 mutation-like (p53mt-like) IHC was identified by p53 TS7,8 with PLK1≥TS 5 and p21 TS≤6. p53 mt-like IHC correlated with TP53 mutation (predictive value=0.94). In other 157 breast cancer cases, p53 mt-like was an independent prognostic marker in multivariate analysis and a strong prognostic factor. Stratification with p53 mt-like IHC identified patients with a poorer prognosis. In conclusion, we identified reliable IHC conditions to predict the TP53 status of breast cancer patients.
26395639	ATRX loss in adult supratentorial diffuse astrocytomas correlates with p53 over expression and IDH1 mutation and predicts better outcome in p53 accumulated patients.	Shao LW, Pan Y, Qi XL, Li YX, Ma XL, Yi WN, Zhang J, Zhong YF, Chang Q.	BACKGROUND: IDH1/2 mutation, 1p/19q-codeletion and MGMT hypermethylation are well known molecular markers for gliomas. ATRX and p53 alterations are two lineage-specific genetic aberrations in diffuse astrocytic tumors. The aim of the present study is to clarify the significance of ATRX loss and its correlation with p53 overexpression, IDH1/2 mutations, 1p/19q-codeletion and MGMT hypermethylation in supertentorial astrocytoma, and to determine the prognostic value of these factors in Chinese patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 135 adult supertentorial astrocytomas were evaluated. ATRX loss was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and was shown to be much less frequent in pGBs (3.5%) than in grade II, III astrocytomas and IV sGBs (31%). Direct sequencing and/or IHC analysis of the IDH1R132H gene mutation and p53 accumulation demonstrated correlation with age. Strong correlations were found between ATRX loss and IDH1R132H mutation, p53 overexpression as well as MGMT hypermethylation. 1p/19q-codeletion detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed mutually exclusive with ATRX loss and p53 accumulation. In addition, patients with p53 overexpression combined with ATRX alterations demonstrated substantially longer survival than patients with wild-type ATRX. CONCLUSIONS: There may be interactions among these distinct molecules in astrocytoma development. ATRX loss may predict better clinical outcome in astrocytoma patients with p53 overexpression as compared to patients with wild-type ATRX. Tumors with astrocytoma phenotype accompanied by 1p/19q-codeletion and IDH1R132H mutation are mutually exclusive with ATRX and p53 alterations. Routine IHC can be used for evaluation of ATRX loss, p53 protein accumulation and IDH1R132H mutation, which may allow a means of classification of astrocytoma outcome.
26200271	Inhibiting MDM2-p53 Interaction Suppresses Tumor Growth in Patient-Derived Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Xenograft Models.	Hai J, Sakashita S, Allo G, Ludkovski O, Ng C, Shepherd FA, Tsao MS.	BACKGROUND: The tumor suppressor p53 is frequently inactivated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Activation of the p53 pathway by inhibition of its negative regulator MDM2 may offer an attractive approach for NSCLC therapy. We evaluated the antitumor activity of the small-molecule MDM2 inhibitor RG7388 in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of NSCLC. METHODS: We investigated the effect of RG7388 treatment on cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis using a panel of human NSCLC cell lines (A549, H157, H1650, H1395, and H358) and PDX cell lines (human lung cell lines 12, 137, 277, and 196). PDX-bearing mice were used to test the therapeutic efficacy and pharmacodynamic effects of RG7388 treatment. RESULTS: We demonstrated that RG7388 promotes low nanomolar antiproliferative activity selectively in cell lines with wild-type p53 and p53 pathway activation, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In PDX models, oral administration of RG7388 led to potent dose-dependent and time-dependent activation of p53 and had a significant impact on p53 downstream targets. Daily treatment of RG7388 in mice at 50 and 80 mg/kg/day inhibited tumor growth in three wild-type p53 PDX models. Activation of the p53 pathway inhibited cell proliferation as observed by reduced Ki-67-positive cells in xenograft tumors. However, induction of apoptotic caspase activity was not observed in these tumors. Notably, RG7388 treatment remains effective in tumors lacking MDM2 amplification but expressing wild-type p53. CONCLUSIONS: MDM2 small-molecule inhibitor is effective in treating NSCLC tumors with wild-type p53, supporting further clinical investigation as a potential NSCLC therapy.
25334010	Programmed cell death 2 protein induces gastric cancer cell growth arrest at the early S phase of the cell cycle and apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner.	Zhang J, Wei W, Jin HC, Ying RC, Zhu AK, Zhang FJ.	Programmed cell death 2 (PDCD2) is a highly conserved nuclear protein, and aberrant PDCD2 expression alters cell apoptosis. The present study aimed to investigate PDCD2 expression in gastric cancer. Tissue specimens from 34 gastric cancer patients were collected for analysis of PDCD2 expression using immunohistochemistry, western blotting and qRT-PCR. Gastric cancer cell lines (a p53-mutated MKN28 line and a wild-type p53 MKN45 line) were used to assess the effects of PDCD2 overexpression. p53-/- nude mice were used to investigate the effect of PDCD2 on ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced skin carcinogenesis. The data showed that PDCD2 expression was reduced in gastric cancer tissue specimens, and loss of PDCD2 expression was associated with the poor survival of patients. PDCD2 expression induced gastric cancer cell growth arrest at the early S phase of the cell cycle and apoptosis. The antitumor effects of PDCD2 expression were dependent on p53 expression in gastric cancer cells. Moreover, PDCD2 expression inhibited activity of the ATM/Chk1/2/p53 signaling pathway. In addition, PDCD2 expression suppressed UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis in p53+/+ nude mice, but not in p53-/- mice. The data from the present study demonstrated that loss of PDCD2 expression could contribute to gastric cancer development and progression and that PDCD2-induced gastric cancer cell growth arrest at the early S phase of the cell cycle and apoptosis are p53-dependent.
26022179	The BARD1 BRCT domain contributes to p53 binding, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial localization, and apoptotic function.	Tembe V, Martino-Echarri E, Marzec KA, Mok MT, Brodie KM, Mills K, Lei Y, DeFazio A, Rizos H, Kettle E, Boadle R, Henderson BR.	BARD1 is a breast cancer tumor suppressor with multiple domains and functions. BARD1 comprises a tandem BRCT domain at the C-terminus, and this sequence has been reported to target BARD1 to distinct subcellular locations such as nuclear DNA breakage sites and the centrosome through binding to regulatory proteins such as HP1 and OLA1, respectively. We now identify the BRCT domain as a binding site for p53. We first confirmed previous reports that endogenous BARD1 binds to p53 by immunoprecipitation assay, and further show that BARD1/p53 complexes locate at mitochondria suggesting a cellular location for p53 regulation of BARD1 apoptotic activity. We used a proximity ligation assay to map three distinct p53 binding sequences in human BARD1, ranging from weak (425-525) and modest (525-567) to strong (551-777 comprising BRCT domains). Deletion of the BRCT sequence caused major defects in the ability of BARD1 to (1) bind p53, (2) localize to the cytoplasm and mitochondria, and (3) induce Bax oligomerization and apoptosis. Our data suggest that BARD1 can move to mitochondria independent of p53, but subsequently associates with p53 to induce Bax clustering in part by decreasing mitochondrial Bcl-2 levels. We therefore identify a role for the BRCT domain in stimulating BARD1 nuclear export and mitochondrial localization, and in assembling mitochondrial BARD1/p53 complexes to regulate specific activities such as apoptotic function.
25550083	Structural and sequential context of p53: A review of experimental and theoretical evidence.	Saha T, Kar RK, Sa G.	Approximately 27 million people are suffering from cancer that contains either an inactivating missense mutation of TP53 gene or partially abrogated p53 signaling pathway. Concerted action of folded and intrinsically disordered domains accounts for multi-faceted role of p53. The intricacy of dynamic p53 structure is believed to shed light on its cellular activity for developing new cancer therapies. In this review, insights into structural details of p53, diverse single point mutations affecting its core domain, thermodynamic understanding and therapeutic strategies for pharmacological rescue of p53 function has been illustrated. An effort has been made here to bridge the structural and sequential evidence of p53 from experimental to computational studies. First, we focused on the individual domains and the crucial protein-protein or DNA-protein contacts that determine conformation and dynamic behavior of p53. Next, the oncogenic mutations associated with cancer and its contribution to thermodynamic fluctuation has been discussed. Thus the emerging anti-cancer strategies include targeting of destabilized cancer mutants with selective inhibition of its negative regulators. Recent advances in development of small molecule inhibitors and peptides exploiting p53-MDM2 interaction has been included. In a nutshell, this review attempts to describe structural biology of p53 which provide new openings for structure-guided rescue.
25681550	p53 inhibition provides a pivotal protective effect against ischemia-reperfusion injury in vitro via mTOR signaling.	Li X, Gu S, Ling Y, Shen C, Cao X, Xie R.	Tumor suppressor p53 has recently been reported to have numerous functions independent of tumorigenesis, including neuronal survival during ischemia. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway plays a central role in the regulation of metabolism, cell growth, development, and cell survival. Our recent work has demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of the mTOR pathway. Considering that p53 is also an important regulator of mTOR, to further clarify the role of p53 and the mTOR signaling pathway in neuronal ischemic-reperfusion injury, we used mouse primary mixed cultured neurons with an oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) model to mimic an ischemic-reperfusion injury in vitro. A lentiviral system was also used to inhibit or overexpress p53 to determine whether p53 alteration affects OGD and reperfusion injury. Our results show that activated p53 was induced and it suppressed mTOR expression in primary mixed cultured neurons after OGD and reperfusion. Inhibiting p53, using either a chemical inhibitor or lentiviral-mediated shRNA, exhibited neuroprotective effects in primary cultured neurons against OGD and reperfusion injury through the upregulation of mTOR activity. Such protective effects could be reversed by rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor. Conversely, p53 overexpression tended to exacerbate the detrimental effects of OGD injury by downregulating mTOR activity. These results suggest that p53 inhibition has a pivotal protective effect against an in vitro ischemia-reperfusion injury via mTOR signaling and provides a potential and promising therapeutic target for stroke treatment.
25903973	Accumulation of tissue factor in endothelial cells induces cell apoptosis, mediated through p38 and p53 activation.	ElKeeb AM, Collier ME, Maraveyas A, Ettelaie C.	We previously reported that high levels of tissue factor (TF) can induce cellular apoptosis in endothelial cells. In this study, TF-mediated mechanisms of induction of apoptosis were explored. Endothelial cells were transfected to express wild-type TF. Additionally, cells were transfected to express Asp253-substituted, or Ala253-substitued TF to enhance or prevent TF release, respectively. Alternatively, cells were pre-incubated with TF-rich and TF-poor microvesicles. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and the expression of cyclin D1, p53, bax and p21 were measured following activation of cells with PAR2-agonist peptide. Greatest levels of cell proliferation and cyclin D1 expression were observed in cells expressing wild-type or Asp253-substituted TF. In contrast, increased cellular apoptosis was observed in cells expressing Ala253-substituted TF, or cells pre-incubated with TF-rich microvesicles. The level of p53 protein, p53-phosphorylation at ser33, p53 nuclear localisation and transcriptional activity, but not p53 mRNA, were increased in cells expressing wild-type and Ala253-substituted TF, or in cells pre-incubated with TF-rich microvesicles. However, the expression of bax and p21 mRNA, and Bax protein were only increased in cells pre-incubated with TF-rich microvesicle and in cells expressing Ala253-substituted TF. Inhibition of the transcriptional activity of p53 using pifithrin-α suppressed the expression of Bax. Finally, siRNA-mediated suppression of p38α, or inhibition using SB202190 significantly reduced the p53 protein levels, p53 nuclear localisation and transcriptional activity, suppressed Bax expression and prevented cellular apoptosis. In conclusion, accumulation of TF within endothelial cells, or sequestered from the surrounding can induce cellular apoptosis through mechanisms mediated by p38, and involves the stabilisation of p53.
26223322	Mutant p53 promotes ovarian cancer cell adhesion to mesothelial cells via integrin β4 and Akt signals.	Lee JG, Ahn JH, Jin Kim T, Ho Lee J, Choi JH.	Missense mutations in the TP53 gene resulting in the accumulation of mutant proteins are extremely common in advanced ovarian cancer, which is characterised by peritoneal metastasis. Attachment of cancer cells to the peritoneal mesothelium is regarded as an initial, key step for the metastatic spread of ovarian cancer. In the present study, we investigated the possible role of a p53 mutant in the mesothelial adhesion of ovarian cancer cells. We found that OVCAR-3 cells with the R248 TP53 mutation (p53(R248)) were more adhesive to mesothelial Met5A cells than were A2780 cells expressing wild-type p53. In addition, ectopic expression of p53(R248) in p53-null SKOV-3 cells significantly increased adhesion to Met5A cells. Knockdown of mutant p53 significantly compromised p53(R248)-induced cell adhesion to Met5A cells. Microarray analysis revealed that several adhesion-related genes, including integrin β4, were markedly up-regulated, and certain signalling pathways, including PI3K/Akt, were activated in p53(R248) transfectants of SKOV-3 cells. Inhibition of integrin β4 and Akt signalling using blocking antibody and the inhibitor LY294002, respectively, significantly attenuated p53(R248)-mediated ovarian cancer-mesothelial adhesion. These data suggest that the p53(R248) mutant endows ovarian cancer cells with increased adhesiveness and that integrin β4 and Akt signalling are associated with the mutation-enhanced ovarian cancer-mesothelial cell adhesion.
26206331	Inhibition of Wild-Type p53-Expressing AML by the Novel Small Molecule HDM2 Inhibitor CGM097.	Weisberg E, Halilovic E, Cooke VG, Nonami A, Ren T, Sanda T, Simkin I, Yuan J, Antonakos B, Barys L, Ito M, Stone R, Galinsky I, Cowens K, Nelson E, Sattler M, Jeay S, Wuerthner JU, McDonough SM, Wiesmann M, Griffin JD.	The tumor suppressor p53 is a key regulator of apoptosis and functions upstream in the apoptotic cascade by both indirectly and directly regulating Bcl-2 family proteins. In cells expressing wild-type (WT) p53, the HDM2 protein binds to p53 and blocks its activity. Inhibition of HDM2:p53 interaction activates p53 and causes apoptosis or cell-cycle arrest. Here, we investigated the ability of the novel HDM2 inhibitor CGM097 to potently and selectively kill WT p53-expressing AML cells. The antileukemic effects of CGM097 were studied using cell-based proliferation assays (human AML cell lines, primary AML patient cells, and normal bone marrow samples), apoptosis, and cell-cycle assays, ELISA, immunoblotting, and an AML patient-derived in vivo mouse model. CGM097 potently and selectively inhibited the proliferation of human AML cell lines and the majority of primary AML cells expressing WT p53, but not mutant p53, in a target-specific manner. Several patient samples that harbored mutant p53 were comparatively unresponsive to CGM097. Synergy was observed when CGM097 was combined with FLT3 inhibition against oncogenic FLT3-expressing cells cultured both in the absence as well as the presence of cytoprotective stromal-secreted cytokines, as well as when combined with MEK inhibition in cells with activated MAPK signaling. Finally, CGM097 was effective in reducing leukemia burden in vivo. These data suggest that CGM097 is a promising treatment for AML characterized as harboring WT p53 as a single agent, as well as in combination with other therapies targeting oncogene-activated pathways that drive AML.

26050209	In vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism of pyrazole-based small molecule inhibitors of Mdm2/4-p53 interaction.	Christner SM, Clausen DM, Beumer JH, Parise RA, Guo J, Huang Y, Dömling AS, Eiseman JL.	PURPOSE: The interaction of p53 with its negative regulators Mdm2/4 has been widely studied (Khoury and Domling in Curr Pharm Des 18(30):4668-4678, 2012). In p53(+/+) cells, expression of Mdm2/4 leads to p53 turnover, inhibition of downstream transcription, decreasing cell cycle arrest, or apoptosis. We report in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism of YH264, YH263, and WW751, three proposed small molecule inhibitors of the Mdm2/4-p53 interaction. METHODS: MTT cytotoxicity assays were performed, and alterations in proteins were examined using western blots. Mice were dosed 150 mg/kg YH264 or YH263 IV or PO QDx5. Mice were IV dosed 88, 57, or 39 mg/kg WW751 for 3, 5, or 5 days. YH264, YH263, and WW751 and metabolites were quantitated by LC-MS/MS. RESULTS: IC50 values for YH264, YH263, and WW751 against p53 wild-type HCT 116 cells after 72 h of incubation were 18.3 ± 2.3, 8.9 ± 0.6, and 3.1 ± 0.2 μM, respectively. Only YH264 appeared to affect p53 expression in vitro. None of the compounds affected the growth of HCT 116 xenografts in C.B-17 SCID mice. YH264 plasma half-life was 147 min; YH263 plasma half-life was 263 min; and WW751 plasma half-life was less than 120 min. CONCLUSIONS: Despite dosing the mice at the maximum soluble doses, we could not achieve tumor concentrations equivalent to the intracellular concentrations required to inhibit cell growth in vitro. YH263 and WW751 do not appear to affect p53/Mdm2, and none of the three were active in a subcutaneous HCT 116 p53(+/+) xenograft model.
26066464	PI3K/Akt/p53 pathway inhibits reovirus infection.	Zhang X, Wu H, Liu C, Tian J, Qu L.	Viral infections activate many host signaling pathways, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, which has recently attracted considerable interest due to its central role in modulating virus replication. This study demonstrated that the sero-type 3 reovirus strain Masked Palm Civet/China/2004 (MPC/04) could transiently activate the PI3K/Akt pathway in A549 cells at earlier time points of infection. The blockage of PI3K/Akt activation increased viral RNA synthesis and yield. The role of the downstream effectors MDM2/p53 of PI3K/Akt in regulating reovirus replication was further analyzed. We found that during reovirus infection, the level of phosphorylated MDM2 (p-MDM2) was increased and the expression of p53 was reduced. In addition, the blockage of PI3K/Akt by Ly294002 or knockdown of Akt by siRNA reduced the level of p-MDM2 and increased the level of p53. Both indicated that the downstream effectors MDM2/p53 of PI3K/Akt were activated. Pre-treatment with Nutlin, which can destroy MDM2 and p53 cross-talk and increase the expression of p53 RNA and protein, dose-dependently enhanced reovirus replication. Additionally, the overexpression of p53 alone also supported reovirus replication, and knockdown of p53 significantly inhibited viral replication. This study demonstrates that PI3K/Akt/p53 activated by mammalian reovirus can serve as a pathway for inhibiting virus replication/infection, yet the precise mechanism of this process remains under further investigation.
25672611	Association of p53 and mdm2 in the development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer.	Javid J, Mir R, Julka PK, Ray PC, Saxena A.	MDM2 protein is an important regulator of the p53 pathway and has a large effect on the anti-tumorigenic activity of the p53. Presently, we aimed to analyze the possible association of p53 and mdm2 in the development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer. In addition, impact of an important gene promoter polymorphism of MDM2 (T309G, rs 2279744) on its gene expression and ultimately of the TP53 was investigated in non-small cell lung cancer patients. A case-control study using peripheral blood samples of 100 non-small cell lung cancer patients and 100 cancer free healthy controls was conducted. Expression profile of MDM2 and TP53 gene were evaluated by using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction assay, and MDM2 promoter polymorphism were analyzed by amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction. Non-small cell lung cancer patients expressed more than 6-fold increased mdm2 and about 7-folds decreased in p53 expression levels compared to healthy controls. Higher fold change increase of mdm2 and/or decrease of p53 were associated with advanced status and poor clinical outcome of the patients. A significant increase in mdm2 of about 14-folds and decrease in p53 of about 16.5-fold were observed among patients with MDM2 (309GG) genotype vs just 2.2-fold increase in mdm2 and 1.9-fold decrease in p53 among patients with MDM2 (309TT) genotype. In conclusion, present study demonstrated that MDM2 (309 T > G) polymorphism may be one of the important factors for the increased expression mdm2, which was associated with down-regulation of p53 at messenger RNA (mRNA) level and ultimately may contribute in the poor clinical outcome of the non-small cell lung cancer patients, thus may prove as a promising target for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer at molecular level.
25757558	Transcriptional regulation of microRNA-100, -146a, and -150 genes by p53 and NFκB p65/RelA in mouse striatal STHdh(Q7)/ Hdh(Q7) cells and human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells.	Ghose J, Bhattacharyya NP.	MicroRNA (miRNA) genes generally share many features common to those of protein coding genes. Various transcription factors (TFs) and co-regulators are also known to regulate miRNA genes. Here we identify novel p53 and NFκB p65/RelA responsive miRNAs and demonstrate that these 2 TFs bind to the regulatory sequences of miR-100, -146a and -150 in both mouse striatal and human cervical carcinoma cells and regulate their expression. p53 represses the miRNAs while NFκB p65/RelA induces them. Further, we provide evidence that exogenous p53 inhibits NFκB p65/RelA activity by reducing its nuclear content and competing with it for CBP binding. This suggests for the existence of a functional cross-talk between the 2 TFs in regulating miRNA expression. Moreover, promoter occupancy assay reveals that exogenous p53 excludes NFκB p65/RelA from its binding site in the upstream sequence of miR-100 gene thereby causing its repression. Thus, our work identifies novel p53 and NFκB p65/RelA responsive miRNAs in human and mouse and uncovers possible mechanisms of co-regulation of miR-100. It is to be mentioned here that cross-talks between p53 and NFκB p65/RelA have been observed to define the outcome of several biological processes and that the pro-apoptotic effect of p53 and the pro-survival functions of NFκB can be largely mediated via the biological roles of the miRNAs these TFs regulate. Our observation with cell lines thus provides an important platform upon which further work is to be done to establish the biological significance of such co-regulation of miRNAs by p53 and NFκB p65/RelA.
25312903	E2F1 regulates p53R2 gene expression in p53-deficient cells.	Qi JJ, Liu L, Cao JX, An GS, Li SY, Li G, Jia HT, Ni JH.	The p53R2 gene encoding a small subunit of the ribonucleotide reductase has been identified as a p53-inducible gene. Although this gene is discovered as a target for p53 family proteins, the mechanism underlying p53R2 induction by DNA damage in p53-defiencient cells remains to be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that transcription factor E2F1 regulates the p53R2 gene expression in p53-deficient cells. We found that p53R2 was a target for E2F1 in DNA damage response (DDR), because ectopic expression of E2F1 in HCT116-p53(-/-) cells resulted in the increase of p53R2 mRNA and protein expression, and silencing E2F1 diminished its basic expression. Combination of luciferase reporter assay with overexpression or knockdown of E2F1 revealed that E2F1 directly activates the p53R2 gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed E2F1 directly bound to the site (TTTGGCGG) at position -684 to -677 of the promoter under E2F1 overexpression or adriamycin (ADR) exposure. Moreover, silencing p53R2 could enhance apoptotic cell death in both HCT116-p53(-/-) and HCT116-p53(+/+) compared to ADR exposure, indicating that p53R2 may protect cancer cell from ADR-induced apoptosis. Together, we have identified a new role of E2F1 in the regulation of p53R2 expression in DDR, and silencing p53R2 may sensitize cancer cells to ADR-induced apoptosis. Our data support the notion that p53R2 is a potential target for cancer therapy. The involvement of E2F1-dependent p53R2 activation in DDR will provide further insight into the induction of p53R2 in p53-deficient cells. These data also give us a deeper understanding of E2F1 role in DDR.
26524016	[Expression level of p53 in Tumor Tissue of Patients with Acute Leukemia and Its Clinical Significance].	Sun LT, Xiao WL.	To study the expression level of p53 in tumor tissue of patients with acute leukemia (AL) and its clinical significance.From April 2013 to April 2015, 80 patients with AL in our hospital were chosen as leukemia group, at the same time, 50 patients with non-hematologic diseases were chosen as control group. All the patients were detected by bone marrow smear mear and p53 staining. The positive rate of p53 and staining score were compared between 2 groups. The clinical data of leukemia group were collected, and the correlation of clinical features with p53 expression was analyzed.In the control group, the positive rate of p53 was 6.00%, the staining score was (0.2 ± 0.1); in the leukemia group, the positive rate of p53 was 73.75%, the staining score was (1.9 ± 0.4), the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The expression of p53 significantly correlated with the blood routine indicators, clinical manifestation, multiple infiltration and curative effects (P < 0.05), and the p53 expression not correlated statistically with the sex, age, anamnesis, family history (P > 0.05).Compared with the patients with non-hematologic diseases, the expression level of p53 in the AL patients increases significantly, the p53 expression correlates significantly with the blood routine indicators, clinical manifestation and curative effect of the patients.
26206555	Stathmin 1 and p16(INK4A) are sensitive adjunct biomarkers for serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma.	Novak M, Lester J, Karst AM, Parkash V, Hirsch MS, Crum CP, Karlan BY, Drapkin R.	OBJECTIVE: To credential Stathmin 1 (STMN1) and p16(INK4A) (p16) as adjunct markers for the diagnosis of serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC), and to compare STMN1 and p16 expression in p53-positive and p53-negative STIC and invasive high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC). METHODS: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to examine STMN1 and p16 expression in fallopian tube specimens (n=31) containing p53-positive and p53-negative STICs, invasive HGSCs, and morphologically normal FTE (fallopian tube epithelium). STMN1 and p16 expression was scored semiquantitatively by four individuals. The semiquantitative scores were dichotomized, and reported as positive or negative. Pooled siRNA was used to knockdown p53 in a panel of cell lines derived from immortalized FTE and HGSC. RESULTS: STMN1 and p16 were expressed in the majority of p53-positive and p53-negative STICs and concomitant invasive HGSCs, but only scattered positive cells were present in morphologically normal FTE. Both proteins were expressed consistently across multiple STICs from the same patient and in concomitant invasive HGSC. Knockdown of p53 in immortalized FTE cells and in four HGSC-derived cell lines expressing different missense p53 mutations did not affect STMN1 protein levels. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that STMN1 and p16 are sensitive and specific adjunct biomarkers that, when used with p53 and Ki-67, improve the diagnostic accuracy of STIC. The addition of STMN1 and p16 helps to compensate for practical limitations of p53 and Ki-67 that complicate the diagnosis in up to one third of STICs.
26523671	MicroRNA-34a induces a senescence-like change via the down-regulation of SIRT1 and up-regulation of p53 protein in human esophageal squamous cancer cells with a wild-type p53 gene background.	Ye Z, Fang J, Dai S, Wang Y, Fu Z, Feng W, Wei Q, Huang P.	MiR-34a has been reported as a non-coding RNA universally expressed in normal old cells and a probable suppressor of diverse cancer cells; however, this miRNA's expression and anti-tumor mechanism in esophageal squamous cancer cells (ESCC) remains unclear. We explored these questions in three human ESCC lines, KYSE-450, KYSE-410, and ECa-109, with wild-type p53 and mutant p53 backgrounds. Through a specific stem-loop RT primer for miR-34a, we examined the relevant expression level of miR-34a in these three cell lines using real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). We found that the expression level of miR-34a induced by the DNA damage agent adrmycin (ADR) was both p53- and time-dependent. Following incubation with miR-34a, cellular growth inhibition was exhibited differently in the three cell lines harbored with different p53 backgrounds. Furthermore, the MTT assay demonstrated an miR-34a-related cytotoxic effect in cell growth. Senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) staining was used to examine senescence-like phenotypes induced by miR-34a. Mechanistic investigation suggested that the down-regulation of Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) and up-regulation of p53/p21 contributed to the anti-tumor mechanism of miR-34a in wild-type p53 ECa-109 cells, while neither of the apoptosis-related proteins PARP and caspase-3 caused significant changes. In summary, our findings indicated that the intrinsic expression of miR-34a was relatively low and was expressed differently among different p53 backgrounds and ADR treatment times. The anti-tumor effect of miR-34a was primarily dependent on the regulation of SIRT1 and p53/p21 protein, not apoptosis-associated proteins.
25677450	Cardiac transcription factor Nkx2.5 interacts with p53 and modulates its activity.	Kojic S, Nestorovic A, Rakicevic L, Protic O, Jasnic-Savovic J, Faulkner G, Radojkovic D.	Transcription factor Nkx2.5, essential for heart development, regulates cardiomyocyte-specific gene expression through combinatorial interactions with other cardiac-restricted (GATA4 and dHAND) or ubiquitous (p300) transcription regulators. Here we demonstrate that Nkx2.5 and p53 synergistically activate the promoter of the striated muscle stress responsive transcriptional cofactor Ankrd2, involved in coordination of proliferation and apoptosis during myogenic differentiation. Moreover, the p53 protein is able to interact with both wild type Nkx2.5 and its mutant ΔNkx2.5 (aa 1-198) found in patients with diverse cardiac malformations. Nkx2.5 interaction site of p53 maps to the C terminal region, while p53 binding site on Nkx2.5 lies outside its C terminus. In addition, overexpression of Nkx2.5 has a modulatory, promoter dependent effect on p53 transactivation, while the mutant significantly abolished p53 activity on the Mdm2, p21(WAF1/CIP1) and Bax promoters. Their physical interaction contributes to the observed behavior in the case of the Mdm2 promoter. Our data provide a new evidence for the role of p53 in cardiac function through interaction with Nkx2.5.
25767119	Mutant p53 promotes tumor cell malignancy by both positive and negative regulation of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathway.	Ji L, Xu J, Liu J, Amjad A, Zhang K, Liu Q, Zhou L, Xiao J, Li X.	Specific p53 mutations abrogate tumor-suppressive functions by gaining new abilities to promote tumorigenesis. Inactivation of p53 is known to distort TGF-β signaling, which paradoxically displays both tumor-suppressive and pro-oncogenic functions. The molecular mechanisms of how mutant p53 simultaneously antagonizes the tumor-suppressive and synergizes the tumor-promoting function of the TGF-β pathway remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that mutant p53 differentially regulates subsets of TGF-β target genes by enhanced binding to the MH2 domain in Smad3 upon the integration of ERK signaling, therefore disrupting Smad3/Smad4 complex formation. Silencing Smad2, inhibition of ERK, or introducing a phosphorylation-defective mutation at Ser-392 in p53 abrogates the R175H mutant p53-dependent regulation of these TGF-β target genes. Our study shows a mechanism to reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations that mutant p53 can both attenuate and cooperate with the TGF-β pathway to promote cancer cell malignancy in the same cell type.
25663456	CP-31398 prevents the growth of p53-mutated colorectal cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.	He X, Kong X, Yan J, Yan J, Zhang Y, Wu Q, Chang Y, Shang H, Dou Q, Song Y, Liu F.	Rescuing the function of mutant p53 protein is an attractive cancer therapeutic strategy. Small molecule CP-31398 was shown to restore mutant p53 tumor suppressor functions in cancer cells. Here, we determined the effects of CP-31398 on the growth of p53-mutated colorectal cancer (CRC) cells in vitro and in vivo. CRC cells which carry p53 mutation in codon 273 were treated with CP-31398 and the control, and the effects of CP-31398 on cell cycle, cell apoptosis, and proliferation were determined. The expression of p53-responsive downstream genes was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot. CP-31398 was administrated into xenograft tumors created by the inoculation of HT-29 cells, and then the effect of CP-31398 on the growth of xenograft tumors was examined. CP-31398 induced p53 downstream target molecules in cultured HT-29 cells, which resulted in the inhibition of CRC cell growth assessed by the determination of cell cycle, apoptosis, and cell proliferation. In xenograft tumors, CP-31398 modulated the expression of Bax, Bcl-2, caspase 3, cyclin D, and Mdm2 and then blocked the growth of xenograft tumors. CP-31398 would be developed as a therapeutic candidate for p53-mutated CRC due to the restoration of mutant p53 tumor suppressor functions.
25444898	DNAJB1 destabilizes PDCD5 to suppress p53-mediated apoptosis.	Cui X, Choi HK, Choi YS, Park SY, Sung GJ, Lee YH, Lee J, Jun WJ, Kim K, Choi KC, Yoon HG.	Although PDCD5 promotes p53-mediated apoptosis in various cancers, little is known about PDCD5 regulation. We recently found that DNAJB1 interacts with PDCD5 and induces the ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of PDCD5, thereby inhibiting p53-mediated apoptosis. To investigate these novel roles for PDCD5 and DNAJB1, we performed DNAJB1 mapping with PDCD5. PDCD5 specifically binds to the DNAJB1-D5 domain (Δ180-210), which was found to be essential for the stabilization of PDCD5. Further study showed that DNAJB1 post-translationally regulates PDCD5 stability. DNAJB1 ubiquitinated PDCD5 via a ubiquitin-mediated pathway. In human lung A549 cancer cells, DNAJB1 promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of PDCD5 and inhibited p53 activation. However, DNAJB1 knockdown in A549 cells increased the etoposide-induced activation of the p53-mediated apoptosis pathway and repressed cancer cell growth. Because this function was p53 dependent, DNAJB1 depletion increased the expression of p53-targeted apoptosis genes. In conclusion, we screened a novel PDCD5-associating protein, DNAJB1, by yeast two-hybrid screening and provided evidences that DNAJB1 targets PDCD5 to suppress p53-dependent apoptosis of cancer cells. Thus, we identified DNAJB1 as a negative regulator of PDCD5-mediated apoptosis and found that the apoptosis network of PDCD5 regulates cancer cell death.
25404730	p53 Protein-mediated regulation of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) is crucial for the apoptotic response upon serine starvation.	Ou Y, Wang SJ, Jiang L, Zheng B, Gu W.	Although p53 is frequently mutated in human cancers, about 80% of human melanomas retain wild-type p53. Here we report that PHGDH, the key metabolic enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the serine biosynthesis pathway, is a target of p53 in human melanoma cells. p53 suppresses PHGDH expression and inhibits de novo serine biosynthesis. Notably, upon serine starvation, p53-mediated cell death is enhanced dramatically in response to Nutlin-3 treatment. Moreover, PHGDH has been found recently to be amplified frequently in human melanomas. We found that PHGDH overexpression significantly suppresses the apoptotic response, whereas RNAi-mediated knockdown of endogenous PHGDH promotes apoptosis under the same treatment. These results demonstrate an important role of p53 in regulating the serine biosynthesis pathway through suppressing PHGDH expression and reveal serine deprivation as a novel approach to sensitize p53-mediated apoptotic responses in human melanoma cells.
25613365	Suppression of centrosome protein TACC3 induces G1 arrest and cell death through activation of p38-p53-p21 stress signaling pathway.	Suhail TV, Singh P, Manna TK.	The centrosome regulates diverse cellular processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation. TACC3, a member of the human transforming acidic coiled-coil protein family, is a key centrosomal protein that is up-regulated in many cancers. Previous studies have demonstrated that TACC3 is essential for the survival of vertebrates and is involved in cell cycle regulation in human cells. However, the details of the underlying mechanisms in its cell cycle regulatory activity remain poorly understood. In this study, we showed that suppression of TACC3 expression induced G1 cell cycle arrest and triggered cell death in human cells. TACC3 depletion-induced G1 arrest and cell death were significantly reduced in cells either lacking p53 or with pharmacologically-inhibited p38, indicating that G1 arrest and cell death induction both require p53 and p38. TACC3 depletion up-regulated the levels of p53 and p21 and induced the accumulation of p53 both in the nucleus and at the centrosome. Interestingly, TACC3 depletion led to the activation of p38 and stimulated the recruitment of activated p38 to the centrosome. Depletion of TACC3 up-regulated the phosphorylation of p53 at Serine 33, a site known to be phosphorylated by p38 under cellular stress and further induced the accumulation of phosphorylated p53 to the centrosome. Loss of TACC3 affected centrosome integrity by disrupting the localization of components of the γ-tubulin ring complex at the centrosome. The results demonstrate that TACC3 depletion induces G1 arrest and cell death by activating p38-p53-p21 signaling and triggering a centrosome-mediated cellular stress response.
25567052	Hepatitis B Virus Core Promoter A1762T/G1764A (TA)/T1753A/T1768A Mutations Contribute to Hepatocarcinogenesis by Deregulating Skp2 and P53.	Yan J, Yao Z, Hu K, Zhong Y, Li M, Xiong Z, Deng M.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Hepatitis B virus core promoter (CP) mutations can increase risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. The CP region overlaps with the HBV X (HBx) gene, which has been associated with hepatocarcinogenesis. The cyclin kinase inhibitor P53 is an important regulator of cell cycle progression. We determined whether HBx mutants that result from mutations in the CP deregulate P53. METHODS: A HBx combination (combo) mutant with changes in the CP region that corresponded to A1762T/G1764A (TA), T1753A, and T1768A was constructed and expressed in L-02 and Hep3B cells. The effects of CP mutations on expression and degradation of P53, and the effects on cell cycle progression and proliferation were analyzed. RESULTS: The combo mutant decreased levels of P53 and increased cyclin D1 expression, accelerated P53 degradation in L-02 cells, accelerated cell cycle progression, and increased expression of S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2) in L-02 and Hep3B cells. Silencing of Skp2 abrogated the effects of CP mutations on P53 expression. The kinetics of P53 expression correlated with changes in cell cycle distribution. CONCLUSIONS: The HBx mutant with a combination of CP mutations can up-regulate Skp2, which then down-regulates P53 via ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation, increasing the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.
25938156	[Expression of Ki-67 and P53 protein in oral squamous cell carcinoma and its clinical significance].	He W, Xiao Y, Chen WM.	To investigate the clinical and pathological features and its relationship with the expression of Ki-67 and p53 protein in oral squamous cell carcinoma.Immunohistochemical SP staining method was used to quantify the protein expression levels of Ki-67 and p53 protein in 10 cases of normal oral mucosa, 16 cases of oral leukoplakia (OLK) tissue, and 48 cases of oral squamous cell carcinoma. The relationship of the expression of Ki-67 and p53 protein to clinical and pathological data was analyzed, and SPSS17.0 software package was used for statistical analysis.The positive expression rate of Ki-67 protein in normal oral mucosa, oral leukoplakia and oral squamous cell carcinoma was 30%, 56.3% and 79.2%, respectively; The positive expression rate of p53 was 0%, 43.8%, and 70.8%, respectively; Ki-67 and p53 expression had significant difference among normal oral mucosa, oral leukoplakia and oral squamous cell carcinoma (P<0.05); The expression of Ki-67 protein was significantly elevated with tumor stage, differentiation and cervical lymph node metastasis (P<0.05); The expression of p53 protein was significantly related to the degree of tumor differentiation (P<0.05); The expression of Ki-67 and p53 was positively correlated in oral squamous cell carcinoma (P<0.05).The high expression of Ki-67 and p53 protein in oral squamous cell carcinoma tissues may play an important role in the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma.
26362504	p53 controls colorectal cancer cell invasion by inhibiting the NF-κB-mediated activation of Fascin.	Sui X, Zhu J, Tang H, Wang C, Zhou J, Han W, Wang X, Fang Y, Xu Y, Li D, Chen R, Ma J, Jing Z, Gu X, Pan H, He C.	p53 mutation is known to contribute to cancer progression. Fascin is an actin-bundling protein and has been recently identified to promote cancer cell migration and invasion through its role in formation of cellular protrusions such as filopodia and invadopodia. However, the relationship between p53 and Fascin is not understood. Here, we have found a new link between them. In colorectal adenocarcinomas, p53 mutation correlated with high NF-κB, Fascin and low E-cadherin expression. Moreover, this expression profile was shown to contribute to poor overall survival in patients with colorectal cancer. Wild-type p53 could inhibit NF-κB activity that repressed the expression of Fascin and cancer cell invasiveness. In contrast, in p53-deficient primary cultured cells, NF-κB activity was enhanced and then activation of NF-κB increased the expression of Fascin. In further analysis, we showed that NF-κB was a key determinant for p53 deletion-stimulated Fascin expression. Inhibition of NF-κB/p65 expression by pharmacological compound or p65 siRNA suppressed Fascin activity in p53-deficient cells. Moreover, restoration of p53 expression decreased the activation of Fascin through suppression of the NF-κB pathway. Taken together, these data suggest that a negative-feedback loop exists, whereby p53 can suppress colorectal cancer cell invasion by inhibiting the NF-κB-mediated activation of Fascin.
25855930	The mechanism and inhibitory effect of recombinant human P53 adenovirus injection combined with paclitaxel on human cervical cancer cell HeLa.	Liu YG, Zheng XL, Liu FM.	To investigate the effect of recombinant human p53 adenovirus injection combined with paclitaxel on human cervical cancer HeLa cell proliferation, apoptosis and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).Detection of effects of paclitaxel, rAd-p53, and drug combination on the proliferation of HeLa cells by MTT method. Detection of effects of paclitaxel, rAd-p53, and drug combination on the proliferation of HeLa cells by diamidino-phenyl-indole (DAPI) staining. Detection of effects of paclitaxel, rAd-p53, and drug combination on the expression of VEGF of HeLa cells by Western blotting.Paclitaxel, rAd-p53 alone or in combination could inhibit the proliferation of HeLa cells in 24-72 h. The inhibition is time dependent and dose dependent. Inhibition of HeLa cells in the combination group was significantly higher than single use of paclitaxel group and rAd-P53 group (p < 0.05). The combined effect of the coefficient of drug interaction (CDI) value was CDI < 1, showing that the two have a synergistic effect. Cell inhibition rate combined group of RAd-P53 (5 × l07 vp/mL) and paclitaxel (3 µg/mL) 48 h after application is higher than that of monotherapy group [(54.0 ± 0.92) % vs. (31.8 ± 0.58) %, (27.2 ± 0.55) %, p < 0.05]. The apoptosis rate of HeLa cells in combination group was significantly higher than that in paclitaxel group, rAd-p53 alone group [(83 ± 0.07) % vs. (11 ± 0.01) %, (36 ± 0.04) %, (62 ± 0.05) %, p < 0.05]. Expression of VEGF in HeLa cells of combination group was significantly lower than that of the two single drug groups. Expression of VEGF in HeLa cells was decreased by (81 + 0.08) %, (45 + 0.07) % and (60 + 0.06) % (p < 0.05), respectively.The effect of rAd-p53 and paclitaxel inhibiting HeLa cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis is better than the single drug. Its mechanism may be related to the down-regulation of VEGF.
25820823	Adenovirus type 12 E1B 55-kilodalton oncoprotein promotes p53-mediated apoptotic response of ovarian cancer to cisplatin.	Wang J, Gao Q, Li Q.	The tumor suppressor p53-mediated apoptotic response plays an important role in cisplatin resistant in ovarian cancer. The adenovirus (Ad) type 12 E1B 55-kDa protein binds to p53 and inactivates its transcriptional transactivation function. In this study, we test the hypothesis that Ad12 E1B 55-kDa oncoprotein promotes p53-mediated apoptotic response of ovarian cancer to cisplatin. First, we observed the upregulation protein level of p53 target genes in cisplatin-resistant or cisplatin-sensitive ovarian cancer by Western blotting. Second, after transfection of Ad12 E1b 55-kDa expression plasmid, the expressions of p53 target genes in A2780 cells were further enhanced. Co-IP experiment demonstrated Ad12 E1b 55 kDa associated with p53. MTT assay confirmed that the cell proliferation was enhanced after transfection, as well as the enhanced cell inhibitory rate in the presence of cisplatin. Using flow cytometry, transfection of Ad12 E1B 55-kDa protein induced apoptosis and promoted S-phase transition in proliferation. Finally, results showed that all these changes promoted by Ad12 E1b 55 kDa were attenuated by the exposure of specific inhibitor of p53 signaling, pifithrin-α. Taken together, we concluded that Ad E1B 55-kDa oncoprotein promotes p53-mediated apoptotic response of ovarian cancer to cisplatin.
25698447	Growth differentiation factor-15 encodes a novel microRNA 3189 that functions as a potent regulator of cell death.	Jones MF, Li XL, Subramanian M, Shabalina SA, Hara T, Zhu Y, Huang J, Yang Y, Wakefield LM, Prasanth KV, Lal A.	According to the latest version of miRBase, approximately 30% of microRNAs (miRNAs) are unique to primates, but the physiological function of the vast majority remains unknown. In this study, we identified miR-3189 as a novel, p53-regulated, primate-specific miRNA embedded in the intron of the p53-target gene GDF15. Antagonizing miR-3189 increased proliferation and sensitized cells to DNA damage-induced apoptosis, suggesting a tumor suppressor function for endogenous miR-3189. Identification of genome-wide miR-3189 targets revealed that miR-3189 directly inhibits the expression of a large number of genes involved in cell cycle control and cell survival. In addition, miR-3189 downregulated the expression of multiple p53 inhibitors resulting in elevated p53 levels and upregulation of several p53 targets including p21 (CDKN1A), GADD45A and the miR-3189 host gene GDF15, suggesting miR-3189 auto-regulation. Surprisingly, miR-3189 overexpression in p53-/- cells upregulated a subset of p53-targets including GDF15, GADD45A, and NOXA, but not CDKN1A. Consistent with these results, overexpression of miR-3189 potently induced apoptosis and inhibited tumorigenicity in vivo in a p53-independent manner. Collectively, our study identified miR-3189 as a novel, primate-specific miRNA whose effects are mediated by both p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms. miR-3189 may, therefore, represent a novel tool that can be utilized therapeutically to induce a potent proapoptotic effect even in p53-deficient tumors.
24882579	miR-339-5p regulates the p53 tumor-suppressor pathway by targeting MDM2.	Jansson MD, Damas ND, Lees M, Jacobsen A, Lund AH.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate many key cancer-relevant pathways and may themselves possess oncogenic or tumor-suppressor functions. Consequently, miRNA dysregulation has been shown to be a prominent feature in many human cancers. The p53 tumor suppressor acts as a negative regulator of cell proliferation in response to stress and represents the most commonly lost and mutated gene in human cancers. The function of p53 is inhibited by the MDM2 oncoprotein. Using a high-throughput screening approach, we identified miR-339-5p as a regulator of the p53 pathway. We demonstrate that this regulation occurs via the ability of miR-339-5p to target directly the 3'-untranslated region of MDM2 mRNA, reducing MDM2 expression and thus promoting p53 function. Consequently, overexpression of miR-339-5p positively impacts on p53-governed cellular responses such as proliferation arrest and senescence, whereas inhibition of miR-339-5p function perturbs the p53 response in cancer cells, allowing an increased proliferation rate. In addition, miR-339-5p expression is downregulated in tumors harboring wild-type TP53, suggesting that reduction of miR-339-5p level helps to suppress the p53 response in p53-competent tumor cells. Furthermore, we show that a negative correlation between miR-339-5p and MDM2 expression exists in human cancer, implying that the interaction is important for cancer development.
26320861	Small-Molecule Reactivation of Mutant p53 to Wild-Type-like p53 through the p53-Hsp40 Regulatory Axis.	Hiraki M, Hwang SY, Cao S, Ramadhar TR, Byun S, Yoon KW, Lee JH, Chu K, Gurkar AU, Kolev V, Zhang J, Namba T, Murphy ME, Newman DJ, Mandinova A, Clardy J, Lee SW.	TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer, and small-molecule reactivation of mutant p53 function represents an important anticancer strategy. A cell-based, high-throughput small-molecule screen identified chetomin (CTM) as a mutant p53 R175H reactivator. CTM enabled p53 to transactivate target genes, restored MDM2 negative regulation, and selectively inhibited the growth of cancer cells harboring mutant p53 R175H in vitro and in vivo. We found that CTM binds to Hsp40 and increases the binding capacity of Hsp40 to the p53 R175H mutant protein, causing a potential conformational change to a wild-type-like p53. Thus, CTM acts as a specific reactivator of the p53 R175H mutant form through Hsp40. These results provide new insights into the mechanism of reactivation of this specific p53 mutant.
25354498	Discrimination of p53 immunohistochemistry-positive tumors by its staining pattern in gastric cancer.	Ando K, Oki E, Saeki H, Yan Z, Tsuda Y, Hidaka G, Kasagi Y, Otsu H, Kawano H, Kitao H, Morita M, Maehara Y.	Immunohistochemistry staining of p53 is a cheap and simple method to detect aberrant function of p53. However, there are some discrepancies between the result of immunohistochemistry staining and mutation analysis. This study attempted to find a new definition of p53 staining by its staining pattern. Immunohistochemistry staining of p53 and TP53 gene mutation analysis were performed in 148 gastric cancer patients. Also SNP-CGH array analysis was conducted to four cases. Positive staining of p53 was observed in 88 (59.5%) tumors. Tumors with positive p53 staining showed malignant features compared to negative tumors. Mutation of TP53 gene was observed in 29 (19.6%) tumors with higher age and differentiated type. In positive p53 tumors, two types could be distinguished; aberrant type and scattered type. With comparison to TP53 gene mutation analysis, all the scattered type had wild-type TP53 gene (P = 0.0003). SNP-CGH array showed that scattered-type tumors had no change in the structure of chromosome 17. P53-scattered-type staining tumors may reflect a functionally active nonmutated TP53 gene. In interpretation of p53 immunohistochemistry staining, distinguishing p53-positive tumors by their staining pattern may be important in gastric cancer.
26450685	Expression screening using a Medaka cDNA library identifies evolutionarily conserved regulators of the p53/Mdm2 pathway.	Zhang P, Kratz AS, Salama M, Elabd S, Heinrich T, Wittbrodt J, Blattner C, Davidson G.	The p53 tumor suppressor protein is mainly regulated by alterations in the half-life of the protein, resulting in significant differences in p53 protein levels in cells. The major regulator of this process is Mdm2, which ubiquitinates p53 and targets it for proteasomal degradation. This process can be enhanced or reduced by proteins that associate with p53 or Mdm2 and several proteins have been identified with such an activity. Furthermore, additional ubiquitin ligases for p53 have been identified in recent years. Nevertheless, our understanding of how p53 abundance and Mdm2 activity are regulated remains incomplete. Here we describe a cell culture based overexpression screen to identify evolutionarily conserved regulators of the p53/Mdm2 circuit. The results from this large-scale screening method will contribute to a better understanding of the regulation of these important proteins.Expression screening was based on co-transfection of H1299 cells with pools of cDNA's from a Medaka library together with p53, Mdm2 and, as internal control, Ror2. After cell lysis, SDS-PAGE/WB analysis was used to detect alterations in these proteins.More than one hundred hits that altered the abundance of either p53, Mdm2, or both were identified in the primary screen. Subscreening of the library pools that were identified in the primary screen identified several potential novel regulators of p53 and/or Mdm2. We also tested whether the human orthologues of the Medaka genes regulate p53 and/or Mdm2 abundance. All human orthologues regulated p53 and/or Mdm2 abundance in the same manner as the proteins from Medaka, which underscores the suitability of this screening methodology for the identification of new modifiers of p53 and Mdm2.Despite enormous efforts in the last two decades, many unknown regulators for p53 and Mdm2 abundance are predicted to exist. This cross-species approach to identify evolutionarily conserved regulators demonstrates that our Medaka unigene cDNA library represents a powerful tool to screen for these novel regulators of the p53/Mdm2 pathway.
26132763	Ribosomal Protein Mutations Result in Constitutive p53 Protein Degradation through Impairment of the AKT Pathway.	Antunes AT, Goos YJ, Pereboom TC, Hermkens D, Wlodarski MW, Da Costa L, MacInnes AW.	Mutations in ribosomal protein (RP) genes can result in the loss of erythrocyte progenitor cells and cause severe anemia. This is seen in patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), a pure red cell aplasia and bone marrow failure syndrome that is almost exclusively linked to RP gene haploinsufficiency. While the mechanisms underlying the cytopenia phenotype of patients with these mutations are not completely understood, it is believed that stabilization of the p53 tumor suppressor protein may induce apoptosis in the progenitor cells. In stark contrast, tumor cells from zebrafish with RP gene haploinsufficiency are unable to stabilize p53 even when exposed to acute DNA damage despite transcribing wild type p53 normally. In this work we demonstrate that p53 has a limited role in eliciting the anemia phenotype of zebrafish models of DBA. In fact, we find that RP-deficient embryos exhibit the same normal p53 transcription, absence of p53 protein, and impaired p53 response to DNA damage as RP haploinsufficient tumor cells. Recently we reported that RP mutations suppress activity of the AKT pathway, and we show here that this suppression results in proteasomal degradation of p53. By re-activating the AKT pathway or by inhibiting GSK-3, a downstream modifier that normally represses AKT signaling, we are able to restore the stabilization of p53. Our work indicates that the anemia phenotype of zebrafish models of DBA is dependent on factors other than p53, and may hold clinical significance for both DBA and the increasing number of cancers revealing spontaneous mutations in RP genes.
24469034	Loss of epithelial p53 and αv integrin cooperate through Akt to induce squamous cell carcinoma yet prevent remodeling of the tumor microenvironment.	Savar A, Acin S, Gonzalez CL, El-Sawy T, Mejia O, Li Z, Esmaeli B, Lacy-Hulbert A, El-Naggar AK, McCarty JH, Caulin C.	Most of the squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the skin and head and neck contain p53 mutations. The presence of p53 mutations in premalignant lesions suggests that they represent early events during tumor progression and additional alterations may be required for SCC development. Here we show that codeletion of the p53 and αv integrin genes in mouse stratified epithelia induced SCCs in 100% of the mice, more frequently and with much shorter latency than deletion of either gene alone. The SCCs that lacked p53 and αv in the epithelial tumor cells exhibited high Akt activity, lacked multiple types of infiltrating immune cells, contained a defective vasculature and grew slower than tumors that expressed p53 or αv. These results reveal that loss of αv in epithelial cells that lack p53 promotes SCC development, but also prevents remodeling of the tumor microenvironment and delays tumor growth. We observed that Akt inactivation in SCC cells that lack p53 and αv promoted anoikis. Thus, tumors may arise in these mice as a result of the increased cell survival induced by Akt activation triggered by loss of αv and p53, and by the defective recruitment of immune cells to these tumors, which may allow immune evasion. However, the defective vasculature and lack of a supportive stroma create a restrictive microenvironment in these SCCs that slows their growth. These mechanisms may underlie the rapid onset and slow growth of SCCs that lack p53 and αv.
24469052	p53 suppresses carcinoma progression by inhibiting mTOR pathway activation.	Akeno N, Miller AL, Ma X, Wikenheiser-Brokamp KA.	Genetic alterations in human cancers and murine models indicate that retinoblastoma (Rb) and p53 have critical tumor suppressive functions in retinoblastoma, a tumor of neural origin, and neuroendocrine tumors including small cell lung cancer and medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). Rb inactivation is the initiating lesion in retinoblastoma and current models propose that induction of apoptosis is a key p53 tumor suppressive function. Genetic studies in mice, however, indicate that other undefined p53 tumor suppressive functions are operative in vivo. How p53 loss cooperates with Rb inactivation to promote carcinogenesis is also not fully understood. In the current study, genetically engineered mice were generated to determine the role of Rb and p53 in MTC pathogenesis and test the hypothesis that p53 suppresses carcinogenesis by inhibiting mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Conditional Rb ablation resulted in thyroid tumors mimicking human MTC, and additional p53 loss led to rapid tumor progression. p53 suppressed tumorigenesis by inhibiting cell cycle progression, but did not induce apoptosis. On the contrary, p53 loss led to increased apoptosis that had to be overcome for tumor progression. The mTOR activity was markedly increased in p53-deficient tumors and rapamycin treatment suppressed tumor cell growth, identifying mTOR inhibition as a critical p53 tumor suppressive function. Rapamycin treatment did not result in AKT/mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, providing evidence that this feedback mechanism operative in other cancers is not a general response to mTORC1 inhibition. Together, these studies provide mechanistic links between genetic alterations and aberrant signaling pathways critical in carcinogenesis, and identify essential Rb and p53 tumor suppressive functions in vivo.
26177460	miR-34 and p53: New Insights into a Complex Functional Relationship.	Navarro F, Lieberman J.	miR-34, a tumor suppressor miRNA family transcriptionally activated by p53, is considered a critical mediator of p53 function. However, knockout of the mouse miR-34 family has little or no effect on the p53 response. The relative contribution of different miR-34 family members to p53 function or how much p53 relies on miR-34 in human cells is unclear. Here we show that miR-34a has a complex effect on the p53 response in human cells. In HCT116 cells miR-34a overexpression enhances p53 transcriptional activity, but the closely related family members, miR-34b and miR-34c, even when over-expressed, have little effect. Both TP53 itself and MDM4, a strong p53 transactivation inhibitor, are direct targets of miR-34a. The genes regulated by miR-34a also include four other post-translational inhibitors of p53. miR-34a overexpression leads to variable effects on p53 levels in p53-sufficient human cancer cell lines. In HCT116, miR-34a overexpression increases p53 protein levels and stability. About a quarter of all mRNAs that participate in the human p53 network bind to biotinylated miR-34a, suggesting that many are direct miR-34a targets. However, only about a fifth of the mRNAs that bind to miR-34a also bind to miR-34b or miR-34c. Two human cell lines knocked out for miR-34a have unimpaired p53-mediated responses to genotoxic stress, like mouse cells. The complex positive and negative effects of miR-34 on the p53 network suggest that rather than simply promoting the p53 response, miR-34a might act at a systems level to stabilize the robustness of the p53 response to genotoxic stress.
26137039	Efficacy of recombinant adenoviral human p53 gene in the treatment of lung cancer-mediated pleural effusion.	Li KL, Kang J, Zhang P, Li LI, Wang YB, Chen HY, He Y.	Pleural effusion induced by lung cancer exerts a negative impact on quality of life and prognosis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the value of the recombinant adenoviral human p53 gene (rAd-p53) in the local treatment of lung cancer and its synergistic effect with chemotherapy. The present study retrospectively recruited 210 patients with lung cancer-mediated pleural effusion who had adopted a treatment strategy of platinum chemotherapy. Pleurodesis was performed via the injection of cisplatin or rAd-p53. Long-term follow-up was conducted to investigate the therapeutic effects of cisplatin and rAd-p53 administration on pleural effusion and other relevant clinical indicators. The short-term effect of pleurodesis was as follows: The efficacy rate of rAd-p53 therapy was significantly higher compared with cisplatin therapy (71.26 vs. 54.47%), and the efficacy of treatment with ≥2×1012 viral particles of rAd-p53 for pleurodesis was significantly greater than treatment with 40 mg cisplatin (P<0.05). Furthermore, efficacy analysis performed 6 and 12 months after pleurodesis indicated that the efficacy rate of rAd-p53 was significantly greater than that of cisplatin (P<0.05). A comparison of median progression-free survival (PFS) time identified a significant difference (P<0.05) between rAd-p53 and cisplatin therapy (3.3 vs. 2.7 months); however, a comparison of median overall survival time identified no significant difference (P>0.05) between rAd-p53 and cisplatin therapy (9.6 vs. 8.7 months). In addition, Cox regression analysis indicated that PFS was not affected by clinical indicators such as age, gender, prognostic staging and smoking status; however, PFS was affected by pathological subtype (adenocarcinoma or squamous carcinoma) in the rAd-p53 group. rAd-p53 administration for pleurodesis exerts long-term therapeutic effects on the local treatment of lung cancer. Thus, a combination of rAd-p53 and chemotherapy may exert a synergistic effect and reverse multidrug resistance.
26148608	The effect of mesenchymal stem cells on the p53 methylation in irradiation-induced thymoma in C57BL/6 mice.	Zheng HB, Fu YT, Pan ZX, Yang TW, Sun LH, Chen YB, Tong T.	CONTEXT: Our previous studies showed that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) preferentially migrated to irradiation-damaged thymus tissue to maintain the thymus integrity and simultaneously decrease the incidence of thymoma from 57 to 37.5%. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to investigate the mechanisms by which MSCs decrease the irradiation-induced thymoma formation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thymus genome DNA was extracted, treated with sulfite, and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) as primers. The PCR productions were sequenced after recovery from 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. These sequences were analyzed using ClustalW2-Multiple Sequence Alignment. p53 expression in thymus or thymoma was measured using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Study showed the p53 methylation in irradiation alone group took place at loci +143 and -1190, which are beyond known binding motif of transcription factors. However, Matlnspector Professional Database revealed that locus -1190 is located in binding region of E2A transcription factor. In the non tumor thymus tissues from MSCs-treated irradiated mice, p53 promoter methylation existed at four loci. Three loci of them located at either negative regulation regions or their vicinity. The methylation affects the interaction between transcription factors and p53 promoter to increase the expression of p53. Indeed, an increased p53 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in thymus tissues from MSCs-treated irradiated mice as compared to irradiated alone mice. CONCLUSION: MSCs decrease the incidence of irradiation-induced thymoma, which may be mediated by improving thymus microenvironment and changing the methylation of p53 promoter, and subsequently maintaining genome's stability.
26253838	Nuclear Protein Phosphatase 1 α (PP1A) Expression is Associated with Poor Prognosis in p53 Expressing Glioblastomas.	Shastry AH, Thota B, Srividya MR, Arivazhagan A, Santosh V.	BACKGROUND: Protein phosphatase 1 α (PP1A) is an enzyme intimately associated with cell cycle, the over expression of which has been demonstrated in glioblastoma (GBM). Further, the nuclear expression of PP1A has been shown to be highly specific to GBM. In addition, PP1A has been shown to be a connecting molecule in the p53 containing GBM sub network. In view of these, we evaluated the prognostic relevance of PP1A. METHODS: GBM tissues were examined for protein expression of PP1A by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Nuclear expression of PP1A was scored in all tumor tissue samples. Survival analyses were performed by Cox-Regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with Log Rank tests. IDH1, ATRX and p53 IHC and stratification of all GBM cases were performed and subgroup specific evaluation of nuclear PP1A correlation with overall and progression free survival was performed. RESULTS: PP1A protein expression showed no correlation with prognosis in all cases of GBM or on stratification based on IDH1 or ATRX expression. However on p53 stratification nuclear PP1A expression emerged as strong independent predictor of poor overall survival only in p53 positive GBMs both in univariate and multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: While PP1A expression uniquely associates with poor prognosis only in p53 expressing GBMs, there is a notable absence of such correlation in p53 negative GBMs; thus skewing the overall relation of this molecule with prognosis in GBM. PP1A emerging as a strong prognostic marker in p53 expressing GBMs, enables us to foresee this molecule as a potential therapeutic target.
25791792	Prognostic Relevance of p53 Overexpression in Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors of the Small Intestine: Potential Implication for Adjuvant Treatment with Imatinib.	Yoo C, Koh YW, Park YS, Ryu MH, Ryoo BY, Park HJ, Yook JH, Kim BS, Kang YK.	PURPOSE: Although genetic p53 aberrations are correlated with the prognosis of various types of cancer, their prognostic relevance is currently unclear in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) of the small intestine. METHODS: Between 1994 and 2008, 113 patients with resected localized GISTs of the small intestine were included in this analysis. Patients who received pre- and/or postoperative chemotherapy were excluded. p53 overexpression was assessed by immunohistochemical staining and defined as expression in >10 % of tumor cells. RESULTS: p53 overexpression was identified in 38 patients (34 %) and was significantly associated with epithelioid histology (p = 0.040) and high cellularity (p = 0.004). Relapse-free survival (RFS) significantly differed according to p53 overexpression (5-year RFS rates, 57 vs. 78 %; p = 0.005). By multivariate analysis, which included tumor necrosis, tumor size, mitotic count, and primary genotype, p53 overexpression significantly affected RFS with a hazard ratio of 3.50 (95 % confidence interval 1.48-8.25; p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: p53 overexpression is an independent prognostic factor in patients with small intestinal GISTs. This suggests that p53 expression can be used to further stratify recurrence risk in patients with resected GISTs of the small intestine.
25808808	Regulation of MDM2 Stability After DNA Damage.	Li J, Kurokawa M.	Cells in our body are constantly exposed to various stresses and threats to their genomic integrity. The tumor suppressor protein p53 plays a critical role in successful defense against these threats by inducing apoptotic cell death or cell cycle arrest. In unstressed conditions, p53 levels and activity must be kept low to prevent lethal activation of apoptotic and senescence pathways. However, upon DNA damage or other stressors, p53 is released from its inhibitory state to induce an array of apoptosis and cell cycle genes. Conversely, inactivation of p53 could promote unrestrained tumor proliferation and failure to appropriately undergo apoptotic cell death, which could, in turn, lead to carcinogenesis. The ubiquitin E3 ligase MDM2 is the most critical inhibitor of p53 that determines the cellular response to various p53-activating agents, including DNA damage. MDM2 activity is controlled by post-translational modifications, especially phosphorylation. However, accumulating evidence suggests that MDM2 is also regulated at the level of protein stability, which is controlled by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Here, we discuss how MDM2 can be regulated in response to DNA damage with particular focus on the regulation of MDM2 protein stability.
25837868	The p53 network as therapeutic target in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms.	Briest F, Grabowski P.	Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs) are heterogeneous and especially the midgut tumors currently lack effective therapy options. Actionable driver mutations as therapeutic targets are rare. Subtype specific data concerning regulatory mechanisms or epigenetic aberrations are necessary for novel clinical trials. Although the p53 protein itself is rarely mutated in GEP-NENs, epigenetic and regulatory aberrations interfere with the p53 network activity and might function as s target for novel therapeutic approaches. In this review we analyze the current knowledge about the p53 network in GEP-NENs and discuss three possible strategies that include recovering p53 function, enforcing apoptosis by genotoxic stress induction and restoring silenced gene function, based on in vitro, in vivo and clinical data.
25847737	[Accumulation of p53 protein and overexpression of the HER3 receptor in colorectal cancer].	Amsaguine S, El Mhaia S, Drissi H, Amer C, Ahallat M, El Amrani N, Radallah D.	In patients with colorectal cancer, nuclear accumulation of p53 is often associated with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy. Overexpression of HER3 is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to therapy targeting EGFR. Our study was performed on 16 samples of colorectal adenocarcinomas. The pieces fixed in formalin were embedded in paraffin. The study of the expression of p53 and HER3 is performed by immunohistochemical technique. Immunohistochemical study of the expression of p53 showed nuclear accumulation of this protein in 87% of colorectal adenocarcinomas analyzed. Regarding the HER3 receptor overexpression was observed in 56% of cases. Overall, 50% of the cases co-expressed p53 and HER3. HER3 and p53 are important markers of colorectal cancer because they provide information about the distinctive biological characteristics of tumors. The prognostic and predictive value of the combination of these two markers could be an important clinical tool.
25961932	H3K9me3 facilitates hypoxia-induced p53-dependent apoptosis through repression of APAK.	Olcina MM, Leszczynska KB, Senra JM, Isa NF, Harada H, Hammond EM.	Regions of hypoxia occur in most solid tumors, and they are associated with a poor prognostic outcome. Despite the absence of detectable DNA damage, severe hypoxia (<0.1% O2) induces a DNA damage response, including the activation of p53 and subsequent induction of p53-dependent apoptosis. Factors affecting hypoxia-induced p53-dependent apoptosis are unclear. Here we asked whether H3K9me3, through mediating gene repression, could regulate hypoxia-induced p53-dependent apoptosis. Under hypoxic conditions, increases in H3K9me3 occur in an oxygen-dependent but HIF-1-independent manner. We demonstrate that under hypoxic conditions, which induce p53 activity, the negative regulator of p53, APAK, is repressed by increases in H3K9me3 along the APAK loci. APAK repression in hypoxia is mediated by the methyltransferase SETDB1 but not Suv39h1 or G9a. Interestingly, increasing hypoxia-induced H3K9me3 through pharmacological inhibition of JMJD2 family members leads to an increase in apoptosis and decreased clonogenic survival and again correlates with APAK expression. The relevance of understanding the mechanisms of APAK expression regulation to human disease was suggested by analysis of patients with colorectal cancer, which demonstrates that high APAK expression correlates with poor prognosis. Together, these data demonstrate the functional importance of H3K9me3 in hypoxia, and they provide a novel mechanistic link between H3K9me3, p53 and apoptosis in physiologically relevant conditions of hypoxia.Oncogene advance online publication, 11 May 2015; doi:10.1038/onc.2015.134.
25252686	p53 as a retrovirus-induced oxidative stress modulator.	Kim SJ, Wong PK.	Infection of astrocytes by the neuropathogenic mutant of Moloney murine leukemia virus, ts1, exhibits increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and signs of oxidative stress compared with uninfected astrocytes. Previously, we have demonstrated that ts1 infection caused two separate events of ROS upregulation. The first upregulation occurs during early viral establishment in host cells and the second during the virus-mediated apoptotic process. In this study, we show that virus-mediated ROS upregulation activates the protein kinase, ataxia telangiectasia mutated, which in turn phosphorylates serine 15 on p53. This activation of p53 however, is unlikely associated with ts1-induced cell death. Rather p53 appears to be involved in suppressing intracellular ROS levels in astrocytes under oxidative stress. The activated p53 appears to delay retroviral gene expression by suppressing NADPH oxidase, a superoxide-producing enzyme. These results suggest that p53 plays a role as a retrovirus-mediated oxidative stress modulator.
25407396	Ranking the Binding Energies of p53 Mutant Activators and Their ADMET Properties.	Omar SI, Tuszynski J.	The guardian of the genome, p53, is the most mutated protein found in all cancer cells. Restoration of wild-type activity to mutant p53 offers promise to eradicate cancer cells using novel pharmacological agents. Several molecules have already been found to activate mutant p53. While the exact mechanism of action of these compounds has not been fully understood, a transiently open pocket has been identified in some mutants. In our study, we docked twelve known activators to p53 into the open pocket to further understand their mechanism of action and rank the best binders. In addition, we predicted the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity properties of these compounds to assess their pharmaceutical usefulness. Our studies showed that alkylating ligands do not all bind at the same position, probably due to their varying sizes. In addition, we found that non-alkylating ligands are capable of binding at the same pocket and directly interacting with Cys124. The comparison of the different ligands demonstrates that stictic acid has a great potential as a p53 activator in terms of less adverse effects although it has poorer pharmacokinetic properties.
25495205	Overexpression of p53 but not Rb in the cytoplasm of neurons and small vessels in an autopsy of a patient with Cockayne syndrome.	Miyahara H, Itonaga T, Maeda T, Izumi T, Ihara K.	Cockayne syndrome presents senescence-like changes starting in early infancy; however, the mechanism of premature aging remains unclear. In an autopsy of a 23-year-old woman with Cockayne syndrome, we evaluated the correlation between Cockayne pathology and the expression patterns of the senescence-associated proteins p53 and Rb. Neuropathological findings in this case revealed basal ganglia calcification, tigroid leukodystrophy, bizarre reactive astrocytes, severe cerebellar atrophy with loss of Purkinje cells, and arteriolar/neuronal calcifications in the hypothalamus. Multiple arteriolar calcifications and sclerotic changes were seen in the central nervous system and kidney, but the endothelium of the aorta and coronary arteries remained intact appropriately for the individual's age without any finding of arteriosclerosis. Overexpression of p53 protein was confirmed in the cytoplasm of neurons in the basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus and cerebellum, of arteriolar endothelial cells of the cerebrum and renal glomerular capillaries, and of cutaneous epithelial cells. The distribution of p53 overexpression was coincident with that of pathological alteration, such as neuronal loss, calcification and atrophy. High expression of p53 was localized in the cytoplasm, not in the nucleus. In contrast to p53, Rb was not expressed in any senescence lesion. In terms of senescence, distinct differences are found among organs in a patient with Cockayne syndrome. This segmental progeria differs from natural aging, and implicates p53 overexpression in the etiology of CS.
25735349	Malignant transformation rate and p53, and p16 expression in teratomatous skin of ovarian mature cystic teratoma.	Zhu HL, Zou ZN, Lin PX, Li WX, Huang YE, Shi XX, Shen H.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of malignant transformation and P53 and P16 expression in teratomatous skin of ovarian mature cystic teratoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on ovarian teratoma specimens in nearly 10 years were reviewed. P53 and P16 expression were detected by immunohistochemistry in 25 cases of teratomatous skin of ovarian mature cystic teratoma, 20 cases of squamous cell carcinoma and 2 cases of squamous cell carcinoma originated from teratomatous skin. RESULTS: Of 1913 cases of ovarian mature cystic teratoma in nearly 10 years, only two cases of squamous cell carcinoma were found in teratomatous skin, with malignant transformation rate of 0.1045%. P53 expression was detected in 2 cases squamous cell carcinoma originated from teratomatous skin and P16 overexpression in one. There were no expressions of P53 and P16 in 25 cases of teratomatous skin of ovarian mature cystic teratoma. Of 20 cases of squamous cell carcinoma P53 overexpression (positive rate of 55%) was detected in 11 cases, P16 overexpression (positive rate of 35%) in 7 cases. The positive rates of P53 and P16 expression in squamous cell carcinomas were significantly higher than that in the teratomatous skins (p< 0.001, p= 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: There was low risk of malignant transformation in teratomatous skin of ovarian mature cystic teratoma which can be explained by lower P53 and P16 expressionin teratomas than that in squamous cell carcinoma.
25640374	Prognostic significance of p53 in gastric cancer: a meta- analysis.	Yildirim M, Kaya V, Demirpence O, Gunduz S, Bozcuk H.	BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer is one of the frequently seen cancers in the world and it is the second most common reason for death due to cancer. The prognostic role of expression of p53 detected by immunohistochemistry in gastric cancer remains controversial. This meta-analysis aimed to explore any association between overexpression and survival outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We systematically searched for studies investigating the relationships between expression of p53 detected by immunohistochemistry and prognosis of gastric cancer patients. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. After careful review, survival data were extracted from eligible studies. A meta-analysis was performed to generate combined hazard ratios for overall survival and disease-free survival. RESULTS: A total of 4.330 patients from 21 studies were included in the analysis. Our results showed tissue p53 overexpression in patients with gastric cancer to be associated with poor prognosis in terms of overall survival (HR, 1.610; 95% CI, 1.394 -5.235; p: <0.001). Pooled hazard ratio for disease free survival showed that p53 positivity or negativity were not statitistically significant (HR, 1.219; 95%CI, 0.782-1.899; p:0.382). CONCLUSIONS: The present meta-analysis indicated overexpression of p53 detected by immunohistochemistry to be associated with a poor prognosis in patients with gastric cancer.
26378048	Involvement of p53 in insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 regulation in the breast cancer cell response to DNA damage.	Marzec KA, Lin MZ, Martin JL, Baxter RC.	Chemotherapy drugs that induce apoptosis by causing DNA double-strand breaks, upregulate the tumor suppressor p53. This study investigated the regulation of the growth-regulatory protein insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), a p53 target, by DNA-damaging agents in breast cancer cells. IGFBP-3 was upregulated 1.4- to 13-fold in response to doxorubicin and etoposide in MCF-10A, Hs578T, MCF-7 and T47D cells, which express low to moderate basal levels of IGFBP-3. In contrast, IGFBP-3 was strongly downregulated by these agents in cells with high basal levels of IGFBP-3 (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436 and MDA-MB-468). In MDA-MB-468 cells containing the R273H p53 mutation, reported to display gain-of-function properties, chemotherapy-induced suppression of IGFBP-3 was not reversed by the p53 reactivating drug, PRIMA-1, or by p53 silencing, suggesting that the decrease in IGFBP-3 following DNA damage is not a mutant p53 gain-of-function response. SiRNA-mediated downregulation of endogenous IGFBP-3 modestly attenuated doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 and Hs578T cells. IGFBP-3 downregulation in some breast cancer cell lines in response to DNA-damaging chemotherapy may have clinical implications because suppression of IGFBP-3 may modulate the apoptotic response. These observations provide further evidence that endogenous IGFBP-3 plays a role in breast cancer cell responsiveness to DNA damaging therapy.
26322477	Induction of apoptosis in cancer cells through N-acetyl-l-leucine-modified polyethylenimine-mediated p53 gene delivery.	Li Z, Zhang L, Li Q.	Herein, N-acetyl-l-leucine-modified polyethylenimine was successfully constructed through the EDC/NHS-mediated coupling reaction and employed as vectors to accomplish p53 gene delivery using HeLa (p53wt) and PC-3 cells (p53null) as models. Compared with PEI25K, the derivatives exhibited lower cytotoxicity, protein adsorption and hemolytic activity, together with satisfactory pDNA condensation capability and gene transfection efficiency. After p53 transfection, MTT analysis confirmed that the cell proliferation was inhibited. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the derivative-mediated p53 delivery could induce stronger early apoptosis than PEI25K and Lipofectamine(2000). Further, PC-3 cells showed higher sensitivity to the exogenous p53 transfection than HeLa cells. The mechanism for inducing apoptosis was determined to be up-regulation of p53 expression at both mRNA and protein levels using RT-PCR and western blotting analysis. Expression level and activity analysis of caspase-3, -8 and -9, and mitochondrial membrane potential measurement revealed that p53 transfection mediated by these derivatives facilitated early apoptosis of tumor cells via a mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathway. Thus, the derivatives showed potential as biocompatible carriers for realizing effective tumor gene therapy.
26471094	Interactions between the otitis media gene, Fbxo11, and p53 in the mouse embryonic lung.	Tateossian H, Morse S, Simon MM, Dean CH, Brown SD.	Otitis Media with effusion (OME) is the most common cause of hearing loss in children and tympanostomy to alleviate the condition remains the commonest surgical intervention in children in the developed world. Chronic and recurrent forms of OM are known to have a very significant genetic component, however, until recently little was known of the underlying genes involved. The Jeff mouse mutant develops deafness due to a chronic proliferative otitis media and is encoded by the Fbxo11 gene, a member of the F-box family. We previously reported that Fbxo11 is involved with the regulation of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signalling by regulating the levels of phospho-Smad2 in the epithelial cells of palatal shelves, eyelids and airways of the lungs. It has been proposed that FBXO11 regulates the cell's response to TGF-β through the ubiquitination of CDT2. Additional substrates for FBXO11 have been identified, including p53. Here, we have studied both the genetic and biochemical interactions between FBXO11 and p53 in order to better understand the function of FBXO11 in epithelial development and its potential role in otitis media. We show that p53 homozygous mutants and double mutants exhibit similar epithelial developmental defects to Fbxo11 homozygotes. FBXO11 and p53 interact in the embryonic lung and mutation in Fbxo11 prevents the interaction with p53. Both p53 and double mutants show raised levels of pSMAD2, recapitulating that seen in Fbxo11 homozygotes. Overall, our results support the conclusion that FBXO11 regulates the TGF-β pathway in the embryonic lung via cross-talk with p53.
25677904	Apoptosis induced by chamaejasmine in human osteosarcoma cells through p53 pathway.	Yang D, Wang P, Ren X.	Osteosarcoma cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies, and there is no effective preventive measure to date. Chamaejasmine is the major ingredient in Stellera chamaejasme L. Except its potent pain-relieving efficacy as reported, chamaejasmine also exerted its anti-tumor activity in several tumor models. Here, we reported that chamaejasmine had a profound anti-proliferative effect on human osteosarcoma cells in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner, which was associated with an increase of p21 and bax and a decrease of bcl-2 and consequently increased caspase-3 activity. The main mechanism of anti-tumor potency was mainly attributed to the induction of p53. Chamaejasmine hugely elevated the expression of p53. The results of p53 shRNA experiment further demonstrated that p53 knockdown severely impaired the sensitivity of tested cells to chamaejasmine, implicating the important role of p53 played in chamaejasmine's anti-tumor activity. In conclusion, results showed chamaejasmine induced apoptosis in MG63 cells and could be a candidate drug for osteosarcoma cancer chemoprevention.
26446704	Activated PKR inhibits pancreatic β-cell proliferation through sumoylation-dependent stabilization of P53.	Song Y, Wan X, Gao L, Pan Y, Xie W, Wang H, Guo J.	Double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) is intimately involved in type 2 diabetes due to its role in insulin resistance in peripheral tissues and anti-proliferative effect on pancreatic β-cells. Activated PKR was found to inhibit β-cell proliferation, partially through accumulation of P53. However the molecular mechanisms underlying PKR-dependent upregulation of P53 remain unknown. The results of the present study showed that PKR can be specifically activated in PKR overexpressing β-cells by a low dosage of the previously synthesized compound 1H-benzimidazole1-ethanol,2,3-dihydro-2-imino-a-(phenoxymethyl)-3-(phenylmethyl)-,monohydrochloride (BEPP), and this led to upregulation of P53 through sumoylation-dependent stability. Activated PKR was found to interact with sumo-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, and P53 sumoylation relies on a PKR-Ubc9 protein-protein interaction. Additionally, a ceramide signal was needed for PKR activation to be triggered by glucolipotoxicity and TNFα stimulation, and stabilization of P53 required endogenous ceramide accumulation. Glucolipotoxicity and pro-inflammatory cytokines therefore promote the sumoylation-dependent stability of P53 via the ceramide/PKR/Ubc9 signalling pathway that is involved in pancreatic β-cell proliferation inhibition in the development of type 2 diabetes.
26498357	Amplification of ACK1 promotes gastric tumorigenesis via ECDdependent p53 ubiquitination degradation.	Xu SH, Huang JZ, Chen M, Zeng M, Zou FY, Chen, Yan GR.	Amplification or over-expression of an activated Cdc42-associated kinase 1 (ACK1) gene is common in breast, lung and ovarian cancers. However, little is known about the role of ACK1 in gastric tumorigenesis. Here, we found that DNA copy numbers of the ACK1 gene and its mRNA expression levels were significantly increased in gastric cancer (GC) compared to normal gastric tissues. Additionally, silencing ACK1 inhibited GC cell proliferation and colony formation, induced G2/M arrest and cellular apoptosis in vitro, and suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Gene Ontology annotation revealed that 147 differential proteins regulated by ACK1 knockdown were closely related with cellular survival. A cell cycle regulator, ecdysoneless homolog (ECD), was found to be significantly down-regulated by ACK1 knockdown. Silencing of ECD inhibited colony formation and induced G2/M arrest and cell apoptosis, which is similar to the effects of ACK1 knockdown. Silencing of ECD did not further enhance the effects of ACK1 knockdown on G2/M arrest and apoptosis, while silencing of ECD blocked the enhancement of colony formation by ACK1 over-expression. Over-expression of ACK or ECD promoted the ubiquitination of tumor suppressor p53 protein and decreased p53 levels, while silencing of ACK1 or ECD decreased the p53 ubiquitination level and increased p53 levels. Silencing of ECD attenuated the ubiquitination enhancement of p53 induced by ACK1 over-expression. Collectively, we demonstrate that amplification of ACK1 promotes gastric tumorigenesis by inducing an ECD-dependent ubiquitination degradation of p53.
25944617	The predictive value of ERCC1 and p53 for the effect of panobinostat and cisplatin combination treatment in NSCLC.	Cai Y, Yan X, Zhang G, Zhao W, Jiao S.	Cisplatin is one of the most common chemotherapeutic drugs for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the response rate is limited because of drug resistance. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), which can alter DNA accessibility by regulating chromatin structure and inducing apoptosis, exhibit a synergistic action with cisplatin. However, no biomarkers that can predict the efficacy of the combination of HDACis and cisplatin have been reported. Our study found that panobinostat, an HDAC inhibitor, increased the cisplatin sensitivity of several NSCLC cell lines with low ERCC1 expression but not those with high ERCC1 expression or gain-of-function (GOF) p53 mutation despite of ERCC1 expression level. ERCC1 knockdown increased the cisplatin sensitivity of NSCLC cell lines with high ERCC1 expression without GOF p53 mutations. In addition, in low ERCC1 expression NSCLC cell lines, knockdown of GOF mutant p53 enhanced cisplatin sensitivity. Further double knockdown of ERCC1 and GOF mutant p53 but not ERCC1 knockdown alone increased the cisplatin sensitivity of cells with both high ERCC1 expression and GOF p53 mutations. Therefore, this study demonstrated that ERCC1 expression combined with p53 mutation status may determine the efficacy of cisplatin and HDACi combined therapy and guide the development of future NSCLC therapies.
25591003	Structural convergence of unstructured p53 family transactivation domains in MDM2 recognition.	Shin JS, Ha JH, Lee DH, Ryu KS, Bae KH, Park BC, Park SG, Yi GS, Chi SW.	The p53, p63, and p73 proteins belong to the p53 family of transcription factors, which play key roles in tumor suppression. Although the transactivation domains (TADs) of the p53 family are intrinsically disordered, these domains are commonly involved in the regulatory interactions with mouse double minute 2 (MDM2). In this study, we determined the solution structure of the p73TAD peptide in complex with MDM2 using NMR spectroscopy and biophysically characterized the interactions between the p53 family TAD peptides and MDM2. In combination with mutagenesis data, the complex structures revealed remarkably close mimicry of the MDM2 recognition mechanism among the p53 family TADs. Upon binding with MDM2, the intrinsically disordered p73TAD and p63TAD peptides adopt an amphipathic α-helical conformation, which is similar to the conformation of p53TAD, although the α-helical content induced by MDM2 binding varies. With isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and circular dichroism (CD) data, our biophysical characterization showed that p73TAD resembles p53TAD more closely than p63TAD in terms of helical stability, MDM2 binding affinity, and phosphorylation effects on MDM2 binding. Therefore, our structural information may be useful in establishing alternative anticancer strategies that exploit the activation of the p73 pathway against human tumors bearing p53 mutations.
26302161	Inhibition of p53 attenuates ischemic stress-induced activation of astrocytes.	Ahn KC, MacKenzie EM, Learman CR, Hall TC, Weaver CL, Dunbar GL, Song MS.	In cerebral ischemia, studies of cell death have focused primarily on neurons, but recent work indicates that ischemia also causes damage to astrocytes. Activation of astrocytes is a typical brain response to stress stimuli and is evidenced by changes in cellular function and morphology, as well as upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein. The tumor-suppressor transcription factor p53 has recently been implicated as a mediator of ischemia-induced neuronal death, but very little is known about its role in the activation or the death of astrocytes. The present study investigated the role of p53 in astrocyte and neuronal toxicity using in-vitro and in-vivo ischemic stroke models. We showed that p53 is activated in ischemic brains and in oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced cell death in neurons and astrocytes. Inhibition of p53 activity using either pifithrin-α or small interference RNA interference reduced OGD-induced cell death and pifithrin-α reversed OGD-induced impairment of glutamate uptake in astrocytes, suggesting that p53 might play a key role in mediating neurotoxicity and gliotoxicity in ischemic brain injury. This study shows that p53 is activated in astrocytes during ischemia and that inhibition of the activity of this molecule prevents not only OGD-induced neuronal and astrocytic death but also astrocyte activation and impaired glutamate uptake. These findings suggest that p53 may be a valuable therapeutic target in ischemic brain injury.
25987256	Disruption of the 5S RNP-Mdm2 interaction significantly improves the erythroid defect in a mouse model for Diamond-Blackfan anemia.	Jaako P, Debnath S, Olsson K, Zhang Y, Flygare J, Lindström MS, Bryder D, Karlsson S.	Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a congenital erythroid hypoplasia caused by haploinsufficiency of genes encoding ribosomal proteins (RPs). Perturbed ribosome biogenesis in DBA has been shown to induce a p53-mediated ribosomal stress response. However, the mechanisms of p53 activation and its relevance for the erythroid defect remain elusive. Previous studies have indicated that activation of p53 is caused by the inhibition of mouse double minute 2 (Mdm2), the main negative regulator of p53, by the 5S ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP). Meanwhile, it is not clear whether this mechanism solely mediates the p53-dependent component found in DBA. To approach this question, we crossed our mouse model for RPS19-deficient DBA with Mdm2(C305F) knock-in mice that have a disrupted 5S RNP-Mdm2 interaction. Upon induction of the Rps19 deficiency, Mdm2(C305F) reversed the p53 response and improved expansion of hematopoietic progenitors in vitro, and ameliorated the anemia in vivo. Unexpectedly, disruption of the 5S RNP-Mdm2 interaction also led to selective defect in erythropoiesis. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of erythroid progenitor cells to aberrations in p53 homeostasis mediated by the 5S RNP-Mdm2 interaction. Finally, we provide evidence indicating that physiological activation of the 5S RNP-Mdm2-p53 pathway may contribute to functional decline of the hematopoietic system in a cell-autonomous manner over time.
25400081	Loss of ARID1A expression is associated with poor prognosis in small intestinal carcinoma.	Kim MJ, Gu MJ, Chang HK, Yu E.	To investigate AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A (ARID1A) and p53 expression in small intestinal carcinoma (SIC) and to determine its prognostic significance.Immunohistochemical staining for ARID1A and p53 was performed in 178 SICs using a tissue microarray (TMA). Loss of or low ARID1A expression was observed in 36 (20.2%) and 60 (33.7%) of cases, respectively. Aberrant p53 expression was observed in 99 (55.6%) cases. Loss of or low ARID1A expression was found to be associated with signet ring cell carcinoma and undifferentiated carcinoma, a high-grade tumour, and a higher T stage. No relationship was found between aberrant p53 expression and clinicopathological factors or overall survival. Patients with loss of ARID1A expression, irrespective of p53 expressional status, showed significantly poorer overall survival than those expressing ARID1A. Multiple regression analysis revealed that grade and pT stage were associated significantly with ARID1A loss, and multivariate analysis showed that patients with high ARID1A expression had a lower risk of death than those with loss of ARID1A expression.Low or loss of ARID1A expression is correlated significantly with a high-grade tumour, higher T stage, and poorer overall survival. These findings suggest that ARID1A expression could be used as a prognostic marker in SIC.
26220995	Structure of human MDM2 complexed with RPL11 reveals the molecular basis of p53 activation.	Zheng J, Lang Y, Zhang Q, Cui D, Sun H, Jiang L, Chen Z, Zhang R, Gao Y, Tian W, Wu W, Tang J, Chen Z.	The central region of MDM2 is critical for p53 activation and tumor suppression. Upon ribosomal stress, this region is bound by ribosomal proteins, particularly ribosomal protein L11 (RPL11), leading to MDM2 inactivation and subsequent p53 activation. Here, we solved the complex structure of human MDM2-RPL11 at 2.4 Å. MDM2 extensively interacts with RPL11 through an acidic domain and two zinc fingers. Formation of the MDM2-RPL11 complex induces substantial conformational changes in both proteins. RPL11, unable to bind MDM2 mutants, fails to induce the activation of p53 in cells. MDM2 mimics 28S rRNA binding to RPL11. The C4 zinc finger determines RPL11 binding to MDM2 but not its homolog, MDMX. Our results highlight the essential role of the RPL11-MDM2 interaction in p53 activation and tumor suppression and provide a structural basis for potential new anti-tumor drug development.
25790540	Clinicopathological importance of Ki-67, p27, and p53 expression in gastric cancer.	Çalik M, Demirci E, Altun E, Çalik İ, Gündoğdu ÖB, Gürsan N, Gündoğdu B, Albayrak M.	BACKGROUND/AIM: To assess the prognostic value of Ki-67, p27, and p53 immunoreactivity in human gastric cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 84 patients with gastric cancer participated in our study. We categorized tumors as intestinal and diffuse types, with reference to Lauren's classification. Ki-67, p27, and p53 immunoreactivity were correlated with patient's age, tumor type, grade, lymph node status, extent of invasion, tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, and survival. RESULTS: Decreased expression of p27 (<20% positivity of cells) and increased p53 staining (>50% positivity of cells) were determined in 41 (48.8%) and 29 (36.9%) tumor specimens, respectively, and were connected with both the TNM stage (P = 0.007 and P = 0.039, respectively), and the extent of tumor invasion (P = 0.025 and P = 0.004, respectively). Kaplan-Meier methods showed a remarkable effect of reduced p27 expression on survival time (P = 0.003). In contrast, we observed no notable relationship between survival time and p53 or Ki-67 immunoreactivity (P = 0.372 and P = 0.401, respectively). CONCLUSION: A decrease in p27 expression and overexpression of p53 or Ki-67 may cause advancing and metastatic illness in patients with gastric carcinoma. In addition, immunopathological identification of p27 may be helpful to define patients with gastric cancer who are at an increased risk of death.
26565902	p53 in the Myeloid Lineage Modulates an Inflammatory Microenvironment Limiting Initiation and Invasion of Intestinal Tumors.	He XY, Xiang C, Zhang CX, Xie YY, Chen L, Zhang GX, Lu Y, Liu G.	Chronic inflammation promotes the development and progression of various epithelial tumors. Wild-type p53 suppresses inflammation, but it is unclear whether the role of p53 in suppression of inflammation is linked to its tumor suppression function. Here, we established mouse models of myeloid lineage-specific p53 deletion or activation to examine its role in inflammation-related intestinal tumorigenesis. Impaired p53 in the myeloid linage resulted in elevated levels of inflammatory mediators and stimulated adenoma initiation in Apc(Min/+) mice. In contrast, mice with mild p53 activation in the myeloid lineage attenuated the inflammatory response and were more resistant to intestinal tumor development and invasion, which were initiated through Apc(Min/+) mutation or carcinogen and promoted by colitis. Furthermore, p53 activation also suppressed alternative (M2) macrophage polarization together with c-MYC downregulation. Therefore, as a regulator of macrophage function, p53 is critical to protection against tumorigenesis in a non-cell-autonomous manner.
26146864	A patient with a large intrathoracic malignant schwannoma who showed a complete clinical response to rAd-p53-combined with radiotherapy.	Liu K, Zhao J, Jiang H, Ma J, Tan J, Pei Y, Chen J.	The prognosis of postoperatively recurred malignant schwannoma is poor and there is no effective treatment. We had a patient who was found to have a large intrathoracic tumor 1 year after surgery and could not tolerate an operation for the second time. We then decided to evaluate the synergistic effect of recombinant adenovirus-p53 (rAd-p53) combined with radiotherapy for the patient. rAd-p53 was injected intratumorally twice a week before radiotherapy, a total of 10 times, over a course of treatment. Radiotherapy then followed gene therapy at five fractions a week for 5 weeks, with a total dosage of 80.6 Gy/31f in the center part of the tumor and 62 Gy/31f in other locations. The pathological diagnosis of malignant schwannoma indicated that the p53 expression was strongly positive and vascular endothelial growth factor and Bcl-2 were positive before treatment on protein immunohistochemical staining. After treatment, the diameter of the tumor was noticeably reduced and the center part of the tumor presented as a fluid anechoic area and cavities on computed tomographic scanning. The result of the puncture biopsy showed that there were many fibronecrotic tissues and no significant tumor cells. The p53 expression was weakly positive, Vascular endothelial growth factor was negative, and Bcl-2 was weakly positive after treatment on protein immunohistochemical staining.
25542456	Pifithrin-α ameliorates resveratrol-induced two-cell block in mouse preimplantation embryos in vitro.	Jeong JK, Kang MH, Gurunathan S, Cho SG, Park C, Park JK, Kim JH.	Treatment with resveratrol at concentrations greater than 0.5 μmol/L resulted in the arrest of mouse embryo development at the two-cell stage. Resveratrol-induced cytotoxicity was investigated in embryos by evaluating morphologic features by using the bromodeoxyuridine assay and acridine orange and ethidium bromide double staining. Resveratrol was found to significantly increase the expressions of p53, p21, Atf3, smac/Diablo, Bax, Bak1, Bok, and Noxa mRNA in the embryos, whereas Cullin 3 and Cdk1 expressions were decreased. Furthermore, active p53 positive signal in embryos arrested at the two-cell stage was localized in the nucleus, whereas no active p53 signal was observed in control embryos. Pretreatment with pifithrin-α, a p53 inhibitor, downregulated active p53 in two-cell embryo nuclei and ameliorated approximately 50% of the embryonic developmental defect caused by resveratrol. The findings of the present study, therefore, suggest that pifithrin-α could be used as an effective cytoprotective agent against a reproductive toxin such as resveratrol.
26573797	p53: Protection against Tumor Growth beyond Effects on Cell Cycle and Apoptosis.	Wang X, Simpson ER, Brown KA.	The tumor suppressor p53 has established functions in cancer. Specifically, it has been shown to cause cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. It is also one of the most commonly mutated or silenced genes in cancer and for this reason has been extensively studied. Recently, the role of p53 has been shown to go beyond its effects on cell cycle and apoptosis, with effects on metabolism emerging as a key contributor to cancer growth in situations where p53 is lost. Beyond this, the role of p53 in the tumor microenvironment is poorly understood. The publication by Wang and colleagues demonstrates for the first time that p53 is a key negative regulator of aromatase and, hence, estrogen production in the breast tumor microenvironment. It goes further by demonstrating that an important regulator of aromatase, the obesity-associated and tumor-derived factor prostaglandin E2, inhibits p53 in the breast adipose stroma. This review presents these findings in the context of established and emerging roles of p53 and discusses possible implications for the treatment of breast cancer.

26212071	p53 activity contributes to defective interfollicular epidermal differentiation, in hyperproliferative murine skin.	Cottle DL, Kretzschmar K, Gollnick HP, Quist SR.	BACKGROUND: The role of p53 in the pathogenesis of skin diseases such as plaque-type psoriasis has long been questioned but never resolved. OBJECTIVES: In this study we set out to determine the contribution of p53 activity to defective interfollicular epidermal skin differentiation in a murine hyperproliferative skin model. METHODS: We used the tamoxifen-inducible K14MycER mouse model which exhibits abnormal epidermal differentiation in response to high MYC activity, crossed with p53 knock-out mice. Results- We show that genetic deletion of p53 leads to improvements in granular layer formation. Furthermore, we show that p53 activity regulates down-stream expression of Keratin 6a, Pparb/d and Pparg and is regulated upstream by retinoic acid signalling-dependent mechanisms. CONCLUSION: We conclude aberrant non-apoptotic p53 activity contributes, in-part, to abnormal differentiation and granular layer defects. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
26189069	Enhanced phosphorylation of p53 by microRNA-26a leading to growth inhibition of pancreatic cancer.	Batchu RB, Gruzdyn OV, Qazi AM, Kaur J, Mahmud EM, Weaver DW, Gruber SA.	MicroRNA (miR)-26a has been identified as a tumor suppressor in pancreatic cancer cells. Although wild-type p53 controls cell-cycle progression, its mutant form normally present in pancreatic cancer loses this capability. Phosphorylation is known to restore wild-type activity to mutant p53. We, therefore, examined whether miR-26a treatment can restore wild-type functions of mutant p53 via phosphorylation, resulting in inhibition of cell growth.The human pancreatic cancer cell line BxPc-3 harboring mutant p53 was used for colony formation, cell-cycle, and Western blotting assays. Gene profile analysis was conducted after transfection with pre-miR-26a.miR-26a expression significantly decreased cell proliferation by 80% along with marked inhibition of colony formation and cell migration. Cell-cycle inhibition at the G0/G1 interface was observed along with enhanced drug retention and increased chemosensitivity to gemcitabine. Mutant p53 was phosphorylated rapidly at its Ser9 and Ser392 residues, but not at Ser15 or Ser20. Gene profile analysis of pre-miR-26a-transfected cells showed a significant increase in gene transcripts promoting apoptosis and p53 activation, with decreased levels of genes involved in cell-cycle progression.Delivery of miR-26a may represent a novel strategy for inhibiting pancreatic cancer growth, at least in part by enhancing phosphorylation of mutant p53 to restore its wild-type functions.
25511472	Loss of p53 in stromal fibroblasts enhances tumor cell proliferation through nitric-oxide-mediated cyclooxygenase 2 activation.	Wada S, Matsushita Y, Tazawa H, Aoi W, Naito Y, Higashi A, Ohshima H, Yoshikawa T.	Overexpression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) by stromal fibroblasts plays a critical role in the early stage of carcinogenesis. COX-2 expression is thought to be positively or negatively regulated by inflammatory chemical mediators or tumor suppressors. In this study, the contributions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and p53 to COX-2 expression were examined using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from wild-type, p53-deficient, iNOS-deficient, and p53/iNOS-deficient mice. These MEFs were treated with 1 μg/mL of lipopolysaccharide and 100 IU/mL of interferon gamma for up to 72 h. iNOS and COX-2 expression were analyzed by Western blotting. iNOS was induced earlier (16 h) in p53-deficient MEFs than in wild-type MEFs (48 h). Elevated expression of COX-2 was sustained for a longer duration in the p53-deficient MEFs. In contrast, COX-2 expression was reduced earlier in the iNOS-deficient MEFs. Addition of an exogenous NO donor (0.8 mM of S-nitroso-l-glutathione) to the iNOS-deficient MEFs augmented COX-2 expression. Co-culture with stimulated p53-deficient MEFs promoted cell proliferation of mouse rectal polyploid carcinoma CMT93 cells, but treatment with a COX-2-specific inhibitor counteracted this effect. These results suggest that loss of function of the p53 gene in stromal fibroblasts enhances COX-2 expression by enhancing iNOS expression and the resultant production of NO, contributing to the promotion of tumor growth.
26599019	Metformin Radiosensitizes p53-Deficient Colorectal Cancer Cells through Induction of G2/M Arrest and Inhibition of DNA Repair Proteins.	Jeong YK, Kim MS, Lee JY, Kim EH, Ha H.	The present study addressed whether the combination of metformin and ionizing radiation (IR) would show enhanced antitumor effects in radioresistant p53-deficient colorectal cancer cells, focusing on repair pathways for IR-induced DNA damage. Metformin caused a higher reduction in clonogenic survival as well as greater radiosensitization and inhibition of tumor growth of p53-/- than of p53+/+ colorectal cancer cells and xenografts. Metformin combined with IR induced accumulation of tumor cells in the G2/M phase and delayed the repair of IR-induced DNA damage. In addition, this combination significantly decreased levels of p53-related homologous recombination (HR) repair compared with IR alone, especially in p53-/- colorectal cancer cells and tumors. In conclusion, metformin enhanced radiosensitivity by inducing G2/M arrest and reducing the expression of DNA repair proteins even in radioresistant HCT116 p53-/- colorectal cancer cells and tumors. Our study provides a scientific rationale for the clinical use of metformin as a radiosensitizer in patients with p53-deficient colorectal tumors, which are often resistant to radiotherapy.
26177827	Impact of EGFR and p53 expressions on survival and quality of life in locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma patients treated with chemoradiation.	Gupta S, Khan H, Kushwaha VS, Husain N, Negi M, Ghatak A, Bhatt M.	EGFR and p53 are molecular markers which play important role in tumor progression and development. The objective of this study was to assess the association between EGFR and p53 expression and survival, and to determine whether EGFR and p53 expression levels were associated with differences quality of life in OSCC patients undergoing chemoradiation. A total of 120 OSCC patients aged 20-67 y and stage III/IV were recruited. Treatment response was assessed according to W.H.O. (1979). EGFR and p53 expression in tumor tissue was estimated by immunohistochemical (IHC) method and quantified as percentage positive nuclei. Molecular marker expressions of both EGFR and p53 were found significantly (P < 0.01 or P < 0.001) associated with overall response, survivals and quality of life. Neither EGFR nor p53 expression was associated with hematologic or non-hematologic toxicity. EGFR and p53 molecular marker expressions may have significant association with survival and QOL in OSCC patients undergoing chemoradiation.
26354378	Sirt 1 activator inhibits the AGE-induced apoptosis and p53 acetylation in human vascular endothelial cells.	Li P, Zhang L, Zhou C, Lin N, Liu A.	Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) by nonenzymatic glycation reactions are extremely accumulated in the diabetic vascular cells, neurons, and glia, and are confirmed to play important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus -induced cardiovascular complications. Sirt 1, known as mammalian sirtuin, has been recognized to regulate insulin secretion and protect cells against oxidative stress, which is promoted by the accumulated AGEs in cardiovascular cells. In the present study, we treated human endothelial Eahy926 cells with AGEs, and determined the apoptosis induction, caspase activation, the Sirt 1 activity, the expression and acetylation of p53. Then we manipulated Sirt 1 activity with a Sirt 1 activator, Resveratrol (RSV), and a Sirt 1 inhibitor, sirtinol, in the AGE-BSA-treated Eahy926 cells, and then re-evaluated the apoptosis induction, caspase activation, the expression and acetylation of p53. Results demonstrated that AGEs induced apoptosis in the human endothelial Eahy926 cells, by promoting the cytochrome c release, activation of caspase 9/3. Also, the AGE-BSA treatment promoted the total p53 level and acetylated (Ac) p53, but reduced the Sirt 1 level and activity. On the other hand, the Sirt 1 inhibitor/activator not only deteriorated/ameliorated the promotion to p53 level and Ac p53, but also aggravated/inhibited the AGE-induced apoptosis and the promotion to apoptosis-associated signaling molecules. In conclusion, the present study confirmed the apoptosis promotion by AGEs in endothelial Eahy926 cells, by regulating the Sirt 1 activity and p53 signaling, it also implies the protective role of Sirt 1 activator against the AGE-induced apoptosis.
26519881	Critical role of ARID3B in the expression of pro-apoptotic p53-target genes and apoptosis.	Pratama E, Tian X, Lestari W, Iseki S, Ichwan SJ, Ikeda MA.	ARID3A and ARID3B are transcriptional targets of p53. Recently, it has been reported that ARID3A plays a critical role in the transcriptional activation of pro-arrest p21 in response to DNA damage. However, the role of ARID3B in the p53 regulatory pathway remains poorly understood. Here we show that ARID3A and ARID3B specifically bind to putative ARID3-binding sites in p53 target genes in vitro and in vivo. ARID3B and, to a lesser extent, ARID3A silencing blocked transcriptional activation of pro-apoptotic p53 target genes, such as PUMA, PIG3, and p53. Furthermore, ectopic ARID3B, to a lesser extent, ARID3A expression activated the pro-apoptotic gene expression, and only ARID3B induced apoptosis. Finally, ARID3B but not ARID3A silencing blocked apoptosis induction following DNA damage. These results indicated that, although ARID3B and ARID3A share overlapping functions, ARID3B play a key role in the expression of pro-apoptotic p53-target genes and apoptosis.
26247727	p53- and p73-independent activation of TIGAR expression in vivo.	Lee P, Hock AK, Vousden KH, Cheung EC.	TIGAR (TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator) functions as a fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase and its expression results in a dampening of the glycolytic pathway, while increasing antioxidant capacity by increasing NADPH and GSH levels. In addition to being a p53 target, p53-independent expression of TIGAR is also seen in many human cancer cell lines that lack wild-type p53. Although human TIGAR expression can be induced by p53, TAp63 and TAp73, mouse TIGAR is less responsive to the p53 family members and basal levels of TIGAR expression does not depend on p53 or TAp73 expression in most mouse tissues in vivo. Although mouse TIGAR expression is clearly induced in the intestines of mice following DNA-damaging stress such as ionising radiation, this is also not dependent on p53 or TAp73.
25417702	Functional interplay between MDM2, p63/p73 and mutant p53.	Stindt MH, Muller PA, Ludwig RL, Kehrloesser S, Dötsch V, Vousden KH.	Many cancers express mutant p53 proteins that have lost wild-type tumor suppressor activity and, in many cases, have acquired oncogenic functions that can contribute to tumor progression. These activities of mutant p53 reflect interactions with several other proteins, including the p53 family members p63 and p73. Mutations in p53 that affect protein conformation (such as R175H) show strong binding to p63 and p73, whereas p53 mutants that only mildly affect the conformation (such as R273H) bind less well. A previously described aggregation domain of mutant p53 is not required for p63 or p73 binding; indeed, mutations within this region lead to the acquisition of a mutant p53 phenotype-including a conformational shift, p63/p73 binding and the ability to promote invasion. The activity of wild-type p53 is regulated by an interaction with MDM2 and we have investigated the potential role of MDM2 in the mutant p53/p63/p73 interactions. Both mutant p53 and p73 bind MDM2 well, whereas p63 binds much more weakly. We found that MDM2 can inhibit p63 binding to p53R175H but enhances the weaker p53R273H/p73 interaction. These effects on the interactions are reflected in an ability of MDM2 to relieve the inhibition of p63 by p53R175H, but enhance the inhibition of p73 activity by p53R175H and R273H. We propose a model in which MDM2 competes with p63 for binding to p53R175H to restore p63 activity, but forms a trimeric complex with p73 and p53R273H to more strongly inhibit p73 function.
26196323	Expanding the p53 regulatory network: lncRNAs take up the challenge.	Grossi E, Sánchez Y, Huarte M.	Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are rapidly emerging as important regulators of gene expression in a wide variety of physiological and pathological cellular processes. In particular, a number of studies revealed that some lncRNAs participate in the p53 pathway, the unquestioned protagonist of tumor suppressor response. Indeed, several lncRNAs are not only part of the large pool of genes coordinated by p53 transcription factor, but are also required by p53 to fine-tune its response and to fully accomplish its tumor suppressor program. In this review we will discuss the current and fast growing knowledge about the contribution of lncRNAs to the complexity of the p53 network, the different mechanisms by which they affect gene regulation in this context, and their involvement in cancer. The incipient impact of lncRNAs in the p53 biological response may encourage the development of therapies and diagnostic methods focused on these noncoding molecules.
26288684	Discovery of Novel Isatin-Based p53 Inducers.	Davidovich P, Aksenova V, Petrova V, Tentler D, Orlova D, Smirnov S, Gurzhiy V, Okorokov AL, Garabadzhiu A, Melino G, Barlev N, Tribulovich V.	A series of isatin Schiff base derivatives were identified during in silico screening of the small molecule library for novel activators of p53. The compounds selected based on molecular docking results were further validated by a high-content screening assay using U2OS human osteosarcoma cells with an integrated EGFP-expressing p53-dependent reporter. The hit compounds activated and stabilized p53, as shown by Western blotting, at higher rates than the well-known positive control Nutlin-3. Thus, the p53-activating compounds identified by this approach represent useful molecular probes for various cancer studies.
26294377	Backbone resonance assignments of the human p73 DNA binding domain.	Cino EA, Soares IN, Freitas MS, Silva JL.	p53, p63, p73 family of proteins are transcription factors with crucial roles in regulating cellular processes such apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, and DNA damage response. The three family members have both overlapping and unique biological functions. Sequence and structural homology are greatest in the DNA binding domains (DBD), which is the site of the majority of p53 mutations. Structurally unstable p53 DBD mutants can associate with themselves or p63 and p73 DBDs, impeding tumor suppressor functions. Evidence suggests that these proteins associate to form amyloid-like oligomers and fibrils through an aggregation-prone sequence within the DBDs. Despite having high sequence and structure similarities, p63 and p73 DBDs appear to have considerably lower tendencies to be incorporated into p53 aggregates, relative to p53. The backbone resonance assignments of p73 DBD reported here complement those previously reported for p53 and p63, allowing comparisons and providing molecular insights into their biological functions and roles in aggregation and tumor development.
24925209	Functional p53 can modulate the relationship between E2F-1 expression and tumor kinetics in Hodgkin lymphoma.	Georgiadi EC, Dimtsas GS, Vassilakopoulos TP, Pangalis GA, Kittas C, Doussis-Anagnostopoulou IA.	E2F-1 is the best-described member of the E2F family of transcriptional factors and is particularly interesting in view of its often opposing roles. Our purpose was to examine the immunohistochemical expression of E2F-1 in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and to correlate it with proliferation and apoptosis of the tumor, clinicopathological parameters and patient outcome, as well as with expression of the downstream molecules p53 and p21. The median percentage of E2F-1-expressing Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells was 80.2%. A significant positive correlation was found between expression of E2F-1 and p53 (p = 0.034). Following stratification of our cases, within the group harboring functional p53, a statistically significant inverse correlation was identified between E2F-1 and Topo IIa (p = 0.019). E2F-1 is up-regulated in the context of HL and its expression is inversely associated with proliferation. It seems that functional p53 can modulate the relationship between E2F-1 expression and tumor kinetics in HL.
25859977	Case Study: discovery of inhibitors of the MDM2-p53 protein-protein interaction.	Liu L, Bernard D, Wang S.	The p53 protein, a tumor suppressor, is inactivated in many human cancers through mutations or by its interaction with an oncoprotein, MDM2. Blocking the MDM2-p53 protein-protein interaction has the effect of activating wild-type p53 and has been pursued as a novel anticancer strategy. Small-molecule inhibitors of the MDM2-p53 interaction have been discovered through various approaches, and a number of them have progressed into clinical trials for cancer treatment. Here, we describe the methods and techniques used in the discovery of small-molecule inhibitors of the MDM2-p53 interaction.
25591821	p53-induced microRNA-1246 inhibits the cell growth of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells by targeting NFIB.	Zhang Q, Cao LY, Cheng SJ, Zhang AM, Jin XS, Li Y.	In recent years, miR-1246 has been identified as a transcriptional target of p53 in Down syndrome and may provide a new p53-miR-1246-DYRK1A-NFAT pathway in cancer. The present study aimed to explore the role of miR-1246 in the tumorigenesis of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We found that wild-type p53 regulated the expression of miR-1246 in HCC cell lines, and alteration of miR-1246 modulated cell proliferation, colony formation ability and apoptosis. The nuclear factor I/B (NFIB), an oncogene, was identified as a direct target gene of miR-1246 using a fluorescent reporter assay. Overexpression of NFIB abolished the regulation of cell apoptosis caused by miR-1246 in HepG2 cells. This finding suggests that miR-1246 is regulated by p53 and suppresses the growth of human HCC by targeting NFIB. Here, we propose a new p53-miR-1246-NFIB pathway in HCC.
26408691	Zinc Induces Apoptosis of Human Melanoma Cells, Increasing Reactive Oxygen Species, p53 and FAS Ligand.	Provinciali M, Pierpaoli E, Bartozzi B, Bernardini G.	The aim of this study was to examine the in vitro effect of zinc on the apoptosis of human melanoma cells, by studying the zinc-dependent modulation of intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and of p53 and FAS ligand proteins. We showed that zinc concentrations ranging from 33.7 μM to 75 μM Zn(2+) induced apoptosis in the human melanoma cell line WM 266-4. This apoptosis was associated with an increased production of intracellular ROS, and of p53 and FAS ligand protein. Treatment of tumor cells with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine was able to prevent Zn(2+)-induced apoptosis, as well as the increase of p53 and FAS ligand protein induced by zinc. Zinc induces apoptosis in melanoma cells by increasing ROS and this effect may be mediated by the ROS-dependent induction of p53 and FAS/FAS ligand.
26520632	Unstimulated Salivary p53 in Patients with Oral Lichen Planus and Squamous Cell Carcinoma.	Agha-Hosseini F, Mirzaii-Dizgah I, Miri-Zarandi N.	Unstimulated whole salivary p53 was evaluated in non-involved subjects, in patients suffering from oral lichen planus (OLP) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). A total of 34 patients with OLP, 24 patients suffering from oral SCC and 41 non-involved participants were enrolled. The unstimulated whole saliva p53 level was assayed by ELISA. Data was analyzed by ANOVA followed by the Tukey post hoc test. Saliva  p53  concentration  in  patients  with  SCC  (5.36±1.08)  was  significantly  higher  than  in  healthy participants (0.41±0.04) and in patients suffering from OLP (0.94±0.31). This study could not confirm the precancerous nature of OLP based on the relatively low p53 expressions in comparison to SCC.
26517689	Novel p53-dependent anticancer strategy by targeting iron signaling and BNIP3L-induced mitophagy.	Wilfinger N, Austin S, Scheiber-Mojdekhar B, Berger W, Reipert S, Praschberger M, Paur J, Trondl R, Keppler BK, Zielinski CC, Nowikovsky K.	This study identifies BNIP3L as the key regulator of p53-dependent cell death mechanism in colon cancer cells targeted by the novel gallium based anticancer drug, KP46. KP46 specifically accumulated into mitochondria where it caused p53-dependent morphological and functional damage impairing mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetics. Furthermore, competing with iron for cellular uptake, KP46 lowered the intracellular labile iron pools and intracellular heme. Accordingly, p53 accumulated in the nucleus where it activated its transcriptional target BNIP3L, a BH3 only domain protein with functions in apoptosis and mitophagy. Upregulated BNIP3L sensitized the mitochondrial permeability transition and strongly induced PARKIN-mediated mitochondrial clearance and cellular vacuolization. Downregulation of BNIP3L entirely rescued cell viability caused by exposure of KP46 for 24 hours, confirming that early induced cell death was regulated by BNIP3L. Altogether, targeting BNIP3L in wild-type p53 colon cancer cells is a novel anticancer strategy activating iron depletion signaling and the mitophagy-related cell death pathway.
26599982	Design, Synthesis and In Vitro Activity of Anticancer Styrylquinolines. The p53 Independent Mechanism of Action.	Mrozek-Wilczkiewicz A, Spaczynska E, Malarz K, Cieslik W, Rams-Baron M, Kryštof V, Musiol R.	A group of styrylquinolines were synthesized and tested for their anti-proliferative activity. Anti-proliferative activity was evaluated against the human colon carcinoma cell lines that had a normal expression of the p53 protein (HCT116 p53+/+) and mutants with a disabled TP53 gene (HCT116 p53-/-) and against the GM 07492 normal human fibroblast cell line. A SAR study revealed the importance of Cl and OH as substituents in the styryl moiety. Several of the compounds that were tested were found to have a marked anti-proliferative activity that was similar to or better than doxorubicin and were more active against the p53 null than the wild type cells. The cellular localization tests and caspase activity assays suggest a mechanism of action through the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis in a p53-independent manner. The activity of the styrylquinoline compounds may be associated with their DNA intercalating ability.
25568206	Impact of the adenoviral E4 Orf3 protein on the activity and posttranslational modification of p53.	DeHart CJ, Perlman DH, Flint SJ.	Our previous studies have established that the p53 populations that accumulate in normal human cells exposed to etoposide or infected by an E1B 55-kDa protein-null mutant of human adenovirus type 5 carry a large number of posttranslational modifications at numerous residues (C. J. DeHart, J. S. Chahal, S. J. Flint, and D. H. Perlman, Mol Cell Proteomics 13:1-17, 2014, http://dx.doi.org/10.1074/mcp.M113.030254). In the absence of this E1B protein, the p53 transcriptional program is not induced, and it has been reported that the viral E4 Orf3 protein inactivates p53 (C. Soria, F. E. Estermann, K. C. Espantman, and C. C. O'Shea, Nature 466:1076-1081, 2010, http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature09307). As the latter protein disrupts nuclear Pml bodies, sites at which p53 is modified, we used mass spectrometry to catalogue the posttranscriptional modifications of the p53 population that accumulates when neither the E1B 55-kDa nor the E4 Orf3 protein is made in infected cells. Eighty-five residues carrying 163 modifications were identified. The overall patterns of posttranslational modification of this population and p53 present in cells infected by an E1B 55-kDa-null mutant were similar. The efficiencies with which the two forms of p53 bound to a consensus DNA recognition sequence could not be distinguished and were lower than that of transcriptionally active p53. The absence of the E4 Orf3 protein increased expression of several p53-responsive genes when the E1B protein was also absent from infected cells. However, expression of these genes did not attain the levels observed when p53 was activated in response to etoposide treatment and remained lower than those measured in mock-infected cells.The tumor suppressor p53, a master regulator of cellular responses to stress, is inactivated and destroyed in cells infected by species C human adenoviruses, such as type 5. It is targeted for proteasomal degradation by the action of a virus-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase that contains the viral E1B 55-kDa and E4 Orf6 proteins, while the E4 Orf3 protein has been reported to block its ability to stimulate expression of p53-dependent genes. The comparisons reported here of the posttranslational modifications and activities of p53 populations that accumulate in infected normal human cells in the absence of both mechanisms of inactivation or of only the E3 ligase revealed little impact of the E4 Orf3 protein. These observations indicate that E4 Orf3-dependent disruption of Pml bodies does not have a major effect on the pattern of p53 posttranslational modifications in adenovirus-infected cells. Furthermore, they suggest that one or more additional viral proteins contribute to blocking p53 activation and the consequences that are deleterious for viral reproduction, such as apoptosis or cell cycle arrest.
25023704	Ash2L enables P53-dependent apoptosis by favoring stable transcription pre-initiation complex formation on its pro-apoptotic target promoters.	Mungamuri SK, Wang S, Manfredi JJ, Gu W, Aaronson SA.	Chromatin conformation has a major role in all cellular decisions. We showed previously that P53 pro-apoptotic target promoters are enriched with H3K9me3 mark and induction of P53 abrogates this repressive chromatin conformation by downregulating SUV39H1, the writer of this mark present on these promoters. In the present study, we demonstrate that in response to P53 stabilization, its pro-apoptotic target promoters become enriched with the H3K4me3 epigenetic mark as well as its readers, Wdr5, RbBP5 and Ash2L, which were not observed in response to SUV39H1 downregulation alone. Overexpression of Ash2L enhanced P53-dependent apoptosis in response to chemotherapy, associated with increased P53 pro-apoptotic gene promoter occupancy and target gene expression. In contrast, pre-silencing of Ash2L abrogated P53's ability to induce the expression of these transcriptional targets, without affecting P53 or RNAP II recruitment. However, Ash2L pre-silencing, under the same conditions, resulted in reduced RNAP II ser5-CTD phosphorylation on these same pro-apoptotic target promoters, which correlated with reduced promoter occupancy of TFIIB as well as TFIIF (RAP74). Based on these findings, we propose that Ash2L acts in concert with P53 promoter occupancy to activate RNAP II by aiding formation of a stable transcription pre-initiation complex required for its activation.
25902914	Oroxylin A promotes PTEN-mediated negative regulation of MDM2 transcription via SIRT3-mediated deacetylation to stabilize p53 and inhibit glycolysis in wt-p53 cancer cells.	Zhao K, Zhou Y, Qiao C, Ni T, Li Z, Wang X, Guo Q, Lu N, Wei L.	INTRODUCTION: p53 plays important roles in regulating the metabolic reprogramming of cancer, such as aerobic glycolysis. Oroxylin A is a natural active flavonoid with strong anticancer effects both in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: wt-p53 (MCF-7 and HCT116 cells) cancer cells and p53-null H1299 cancer cells were used. The glucose uptake and lactate production were analyzed using Lactic Acid production Detection kit and the Amplex Red Glucose Assay Kit. Then, the protein levels and RNA levels of p53, mouse double minute 2 (MDM2), and p53-targeted glycolytic enzymes were quantified using Western blotting and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), respectively. Immunoprecipitation were performed to assess the binding between p53, MDM2, and sirtuin-3 (SIRT3), and the deacetylation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). Reporter assays were performed to assess the transcriptional activity of PTEN. In vivo, effects of oroxylin A was investigated in nude mice xenograft tumor-inoculated MCF-7 or HCT116 cells. RESULTS: Here, we analyzed the underlying mechanisms that oroxylin A regulated p53 level and glycolytic metabolism in wt-p53 cancer cells, and found that oroxylin A inhibited glycolysis through upregulating p53 level. Oroxylin A did not directly affect the transcription of wt-p53, but suppressed the MDM2-mediated degradation of p53 via downregulating MDM2 transcription in wt-p53 cancer cells. In further studies, we found that oroxylin A induced a reduction in MDM2 transcription by promoting the lipid phosphatase activity of phosphatase and tensin homolog, which was upregulated via sirtuin3-mediated deacetylation. In vivo, oroxylin A inhibited the tumor growth of nude mice-inoculated MCF-7 or HCT116 cells. The expression of MDM2 protein in tumor tissue was downregulated by oroxylin A as well. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide a p53-independent mechanism of MDM2 transcription and reveal the potential of oroxylin A on glycolytic regulation in both wt-p53 and mut-p53 cancer cells. The studies have important implications for the investigation on anticancer effects of oroxylin A, and provide the academic basis for the clinical trial of oroxylin A in cancer patients.
26138448	Regulation of p53 during senescence in normal human keratinocytes.	Kim RH, Kang MK, Kim T, Yang P, Bae S, Williams DW, Phung S, Shin KH, Hong C, Park NH.	p53, the guardian of the genome, is a tumor suppressor protein and critical for the genomic integrity of the cells. Many studies have shown that intracellular level of p53 is enhanced during replicative senescence in normal fibroblasts, and the enhanced level of p53 is viewed as the cause of senescence. Here, we report that, unlike in normal fibroblasts, the level of intracellular p53 reduces during replicative senescence and oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) in normal human keratinocytes (NHKs). We found that the intracellular p53 level was also decreased in age-dependent manner in normal human epithelial tissues. Senescent NHKs exhibited an enhanced level of p16(INK4A) , induced G2 cell cycle arrest, and lowered the p53 expression and transactivation activity. We found that low level of p53 in senescent NHKs was due to reduced transcription of p53. The methylation status at the p53 promoter was not altered during senescence, but senescent NHKs exhibited notably lower level of acetylated histone 3 (H3) at the p53 promoter in comparison with rapidly proliferating cells. Moreover, p53 knockdown in rapidly proliferating NHKs resulted in the disruption of fidelity in repaired DNA. Taken together, our study demonstrates that p53 level is diminished during replicative senescence and OIS and that such diminution is associated with H3 deacetylation at the p53 promoter. The reduced intracellular p53 level in keratinocytes of the elderly could be a contributing factor for more frequent development of epithelial cancer in the elderly because of the loss of genomic integrity of cells.
26490659	Does anti-p53 antibody status predict for clinical outcomes in metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, plus bevacizumab as first-line chemotherapy?	Osumi H, Shinozaki E, Suenaga M, Kumekawa Y, Ogura M, Ozaka M, Matsusaka S, Chin K, Yamamoto N, Mizunuma N.	TP53 gene mutation is widely known as one of the determinants of impaired chemosensitivity. p53 is a tumor-suppressor protein in humans encoded by the TP53 gene. Some studies have shown that TP53 gene mutation and accumulation of the p53 protein are closely related with serum anti-p53 antibody positivity. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive significance of the serum p53 antibody status in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients treated with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, plus bevacizumab as first-line chemotherapy.Ninety patients treated with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin plus bevacizumab as first-line chemotherapy were enrolled, including 70 whose KRAS genotype was revealed at the beginning of treatment. Before chemotherapy initiation, the serum p53 antibody level was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using MESACUP® anti-p53 test kits. The cutoff value for positivity was 1.3 U/mL, as calculated previously. The KRAS genotype of the tumor samples was analyzed using the Luminex® assay.Overall response rates of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria were 77.7 % (42/54) in anti-p53-negative patients and 69.4 % (25/36) in anti-p53-positive patients. The odds ratio was 1.07. Median overall survival was 36.1 months in the anti-p53-positive patients, and not available in the anti-p53-negative patients (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95 % confidence interval, 0.37-1.77; P = 0.61). The corresponding values for median progression-free survival were 13.3 months and 14.6 months (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95 % confidence interval, 0.41-1.17; P = 0.17), respectively.Serum anti-p53 antibody positivity did not predict chemoresistance in mCRC treated with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, plus bevacizumab as first-line chemotherapy.
26306422	p53 modulates NF-κB mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.	Lin Y, Mallen-St Clair J, Luo J, Sharma S, Dubinett S, John MS.	OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of p53 in NF-κB mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We utilized HNSCC and normal oral epithelial cell lines as our model system. We used a lentiviral shRNA system to silence the expression of p65 and p53 in these cell lines. Mutant and wild-type (WT) p53 background genotypes were analyzed. The expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers was determined using western blotting and quantitative PCR assays. Cell morphology, growth, and invasion were determined using a 3-dimensional spheroid culture and anchorage independent growth (AIG) assays. RESULTS: In HNSCC cells with mutant p53 we found that silencing p65 expression promoted EMT. In contrast, in the context of WT p53, ectopic p65 over-expression promoted EMT. Ablation of WT p53 in normal oral epithelial cells blocked EMT induced by p65 over-expression. We demonstrate that AIG and apoptosis induced by NF-κB activation is regulated by p53. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrates that p53 mutational status is critical in determining the outcome of NF-κB activation in HNSCC. In the presence of WT p53, excess p65 signal can promote EMT. Conversely, ablation of p65 in the context of mutant p53 drives EMT. These results demonstrate that p53 mutational status alters the outcome of NF-κB signaling. These results, though preliminary, demonstrate the critical role of p53 mutational status in determining the outcome of NF-κB signaling and suggest that monitoring p53 status may inform the utility of NF-κB inhibitor treatment in HNSCC.
25415071	Detection of p53 mutations in proliferating vascular cells in glioblastoma multiforme.	Kawasoe T, Takeshima H, Yamashita S, Mizuguchi S, Fukushima T, Yokogami K, Yamasaki K.	OBJECT: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), one of the most aggressive tumors in humans, is highly angiogenic. However, treatment with the angiogenesis inhibitor bevacizumab has not significantly prolonged overall patient survival times. GBM resistance to angiogenesis inhibitors is attributed to multiple interacting mechanisms. Although mesenchymal transition via glioma stem-like cells has attracted attention, it is considered a poor biomarker. There is no simple method for differentiating tumor-derived and reactive vascular cells from normal cells. The authors attempted to detect the mesenchymal transition of tumor cells by means of p53 and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) immunohistochemistry. METHODS: Using antibody against p53 and IDH1 R132H, the authors immunohistochemically analyzed GBM tissue from patients who had undergone surgery at the University of Miyazaki Hospital during August 2005-December 2011. They focused on microvascular proliferation with a p53-positive ratio exceeding 50%. They compared TP53 mutations in original tumor tissues and in p53-positive and p53-negative microvascular proliferation cells collected by laser microdissection. RESULTS: Among 61 enrolled GBM patients, the first screening step (immunostaining) identified 46 GBMs as p53 positive, 3 of which manifested areas of prominent p53-positive microvascular proliferation (>50%). Histologically, areas of p53-positive microvascular proliferation tended to be clustered, and they coexisted with areas of p53-negative microvascular proliferation. Both types of microvascular proliferation cells were clearly separated from original tumor cells by glial fibrillary acidic protein, epidermal growth factor receptor, and low-/high-molecular-weight cytokeratin. DNA sequencing analysis disclosed that p53-positive microvascular proliferation cells exhibited TP53 mutations identical to those observed in the original tumor; p53-negative microvascular proliferation cells contained a normal allele. Although immunostaining indicated that 3 (2 primary and 1 secondary) of the 61 GBMs were positive for IDH1, no tumors contained microvascular proliferation cells positive for IDH1 R132H. CONCLUSIONS: Some microvascular proliferation clusters in GBM result from mesenchymal transition. The identification of useful markers might reveal this phenomenon as an infrequent event in GBMs.
26143716	One-Dimensional Sliding of p53 Along DNA Is Accelerated in the Presence of Ca(2+) or Mg(2+) at Millimolar Concentrations.	Murata A, Ito Y, Kashima R, Kanbayashi S, Nanatani K, Igarashi C, Okumura M, Inaba K, Tokino T, Takahashi S, Kamagata K.	One-dimensional (1D) sliding of the tumor suppressor p53 along DNA is an essential dynamics required for its efficient search for the binding sites in the genome. To address how the search process of p53 is affected by the changes in the concentration of Mg(2+) and Ca(2+) after the cell damages, we investigated its sliding dynamics at different concentrations of the divalent cations. The 1D sliding trajectories of p53 along the stretched DNA were measured by using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. The averaged diffusion coefficient calculated from the mean square displacement of p53 on DNA increased significantly at the higher concentration of Mg(2+) or Ca(2+), indicating that the divalent cations accelerate the sliding likely by weakening the DNA-p53 interaction. In addition, two distributions were identified in the displacement of the observed trajectories of p53, demonstrating the presence of the fast and slow sliding modes having large and small diffusion coefficients, respectively. A coreless mutant of p53, in which the core domain was deleted, showed only a single mode whose diffusion coefficient is about twice that of the fast mode for the full-length p53. Thus, the two modes are likely the result of the tight and loose interactions between the core domain of p53 and DNA. These results demonstrated clearly that the 1D sliding dynamics of p53 is strongly dependent on the concentration of Mg(2+) and Ca(2+), which maintains the search distance of p53 along DNA in cells that lost homeostatic control of the divalent cations.
26070487	5-Lipoxygenase is a direct p53 target gene in humans.	Gilbert B, Ahmad K, Roos J, Lehmann C, Chiba T, Ulrich-Rückert S, Smeenk L, van Heeringen S, Maier TJ, Groner B, Steinhilber D.	The p53 tumor suppressor plays a critical role in cancer, and more than 50% of human tumors contain mutations or deletions of the TP53 gene. p53 can transactivate or repress target genes in response to diverse stress signals, such as transient growth arrest, DNA repair, cellular differentiation, senescence and apoptosis. Through an unbiased genome-wide ChIP-seq analysis, we have found that 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5, 5-LO) which is a key enzyme of leukotriene (LT) biosynthesis, is a direct target gene of p53 and its expression is induced by genotoxic stress via actinomycin D (Act.D) or etoposide (Eto) treatment. 5-LO and LTs play a role in immunological diseases as well as in tumorigenesis and tumor growth. p53 binds to a specific binding site consisting of a complete p53 consensus-binding motif in ALOX5 intron G which is located about 64kbp downstream of the transcriptional start site. We confirmed the strong binding of p53 to the 5-LO target site in ChIP-qPCR experiments. Expression analyses by qRT-PCR and immunoblot further revealed that genotoxic stress induces the ALOX5 mRNA and protein expression in a p53-dependent manner. Knockdown of p53 in U2OS cells leads to a downregulation of 5-LO mRNA and protein expression. In addition, immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation assays indicate the direct binding of 5-LO to p53 protein. Furthermore, we found that 5-LO can inhibit the transcriptional activity of p53 suggesting that 5-LO acts in a negative feedback loop to limit induction of p53 target genes.
26124108	F-box protein FBXO31 directs degradation of MDM2 to facilitate p53-mediated growth arrest following genotoxic stress.	Malonia SK, Dutta P, Santra MK, Green MR.	The tumor suppressor p53 plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability. In response to genotoxic stress, p53 levels increase and induce cell-cycle arrest, senescence, or apoptosis, thereby preventing replication of damaged DNA. In unstressed cells, p53 is maintained at a low level. The major negative regulator of p53 is MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that directly interacts with p53 and promotes its polyubiquitination, leading to the subsequent destruction of p53 by the 26S proteasome. Following DNA damage, MDM2 is degraded rapidly, resulting in increased p53 stability. Because of the important role of MDM2 in modulating p53 function, it is critical to understand how MDM2 levels are regulated. Here we show that the F-box protein FBXO31, a candidate tumor suppressor encoded in 16q24.3 for which there is loss of heterozygosity in various solid tumors, is responsible for promoting MDM2 degradation. Following genotoxic stress, FBXO31 is phosphorylated by the DNA damage serine/threonine kinase ATM, resulting in increased levels of FBXO31. FBXO31 then interacts with and directs the degradation of MDM2, which is dependent on phosphorylation of MDM2 by ATM. FBXO31-mediated loss of MDM2 leads to elevated levels of p53, resulting in growth arrest. In cells depleted of FBXO31, MDM2 is not degraded and p53 levels do not increase following genotoxic stress. Thus, FBXO31 is essential for the classic robust increase in p53 levels following DNA damage.
26027393	[Molecular mechanisms of lung cancer development at its different stages in nuclear industry workers].	Rusinova GG, Vyazovskaya NS, Azizova TV, Revina VS, Glazkova IV, Generozov EV, Zakharzhevskaya NB, Guryanov MY, Belosokhov MV, Osovets SV.	OBJECTIVE: to assess mutational events in exons 5, 7, and 8 of the p53 gene and to reveal mutant p53 protein in verified cases of morphologically altered (proliferative and precancerous changes, lung cancer) and histologically unaltered, lung tissues in workers exposed to occupational radiation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The investigation used formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded unaltered and altered lung tissue blocks (FFPBs) obtained from the human radiobiological tissue repository. The shelf-life of FFPBs was 5-31 years. An immunohistochemical technique using mouse antibodies against p53 protein (<<DAKO>>, Denmark), stained with diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen, was employed to determine p53 protein. DNA was isolated from lung tissue FFPBs with QIAmp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit, (<<QIAGEN>>, USA). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to amplify the p53 gene exons 5, 7, and 8 selected for examination, by applying the sequences of genes and primers, the specificity of which was checked using the online resource (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast). PCR products were detected by temporal temperature gradient gel-electrophoresis and the Sanger sequencing method. The obtained DNA fragments were analyzed on a sequencer ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analizer (<<Applied Biosystems>>, USA). Computer-aided DNA analysis was made using the BLAST program. A package of applied Statistica 6.0 programs was employed for statistical data processing. Results. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that mutant p53 protein was absent in the cells of unaltered lung tissue and the number of cells with mutant p53 protein increased in all the patients with proliferative and precancerous changes and lung cancer, suggesting p53 protein dysfunction. The total number of p53 gene mutations in exons 5, 7, and 8, if there were proliferative and precancerous lung tissue changes and lung cancer, were 25, 20, and 40%, respectively. All the found mutations were transversions (the substitution of purine for pyrimidine or, conversely), indicating the action of exogenous mutagens. CONCLUSION: The results of this investigation have confirmed other investigators' data showing that p53 gene mutations in lung cancer are observed in 40-70% of cases. The differences in the number of cases of altered lung tissue with mutations in the p53 gene (not more than 40%) and in those of p53 protein expression were found in 100%, suggesting the regulation of p53 gene function in the cell at multiple levels.
25025443	Expanding the morphologic spectrum of differentiated VIN (dVIN) through detailed mapping of cases with p53 loss.	Singh N, Leen SL, Han G, Faruqi A, Kokka F, Rosenthal A, Jiang XR, Kim R, McAlpine JN, Gilks CB.	The pathogenesis of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma follows 1 of 2 distinct pathways. A precursor lesion in the human papilloma virus-independent pathway, differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (dVIN), was only recently characterized in detail and is infrequently diagnosed without an associated component of invasive carcinoma. Aberrant p53 immunostaining is frequently seen in dVIN, and in approximately 25% to 30% of cases it manifests as a complete loss or a p53-null pattern. The abrupt transition between p53 loss and basal p53 expression in lesional versus nonlesional epithelium allows clear demarcation between neoplastic and non-neoplastic epithelium. For this study, 14 specimens from 10 patients were identified from the pathology archives of 2 teaching hospitals on the basis of: (1) a diagnosis of dVIN, with or without invasive carcinoma; and (2) p53-null immunostaining pattern in lesional cells. Ten specimens had associated invasive carcinoma. All sections from each specimen that showed the specimen resection margin were stained for p53 and reviewed together with all hematoxylin and eosin sections. Detailed morphologic assessment of the p53-null epithelium was made and compared with the adjacent benign squamous epithelium. The status of the resection margins based on the original pathologic assessment was compared with that assessed with p53 immunohistochemistry. One specimen showed p53 loss in the invasive carcinoma but patchy basal positivity in the region originally diagnosed as dVIN, supporting interpretation as a benign hyperplastic focus, rather than dVIN. In the remaining 13 specimens the areas originally diagnosed as dVIN, as well as the associated invasive carcinoma (if present), were p53-null. In 8 of these specimens, on the basis of the presence of p53-null immunostaining and subtle morphologic abnormalities, dVIN was more extensive than originally recognized. The spectrum of morphologic changes in p53-null regions that were in continuity with areas originally recognized as dVIN were subtle and typically consisted of an abrupt change in maturation of the squamous epithelium (loss of keratohyaline granules and parakeratosis), tinctorial alterations in the keratinocytes, with cells containing more abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, and minimal basal nuclear atypia. Margin status changed from negative to positive in 4 of 13 specimens and from focally to more extensively positive in an additional 3 specimens. In summary, the clonal in situ component of non-human papilloma virus vulvar squamous cell carcinoma can be characterized by very subtle morphologic abnormalities that may be misinterpreted as benign change. This results in underestimation of the extent of dVIN, and, as a result, resection margin involvement may be significantly underestimated. dVIN can also be overdiagnosed in areas of reactive change. Better tools for diagnosis of dVIN are needed; until such tools are developed the limitations in the current diagnosis of dVIN should be recognized.
25881131	Cytogenetic significance of chromosome 17 aberrations and P53 gene mutations as prognostic markers in oral squamous cell carcinoma.	Zedan W, Mourad MI, El-Aziz SM, Salamaa NM, Shalaby AA.	BACKGROUND: Cytogenetic analysis has detected an accumulation of genetic lesions in oral cancers. Numerical changes in chromosome 17 might be associated with an up-regulation of p53 gene, and could contribute to critical events in carcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to reveal possible correlations between the numerical aberrations of chromosome 17, deletion or amplification of the P53 gene and histological grading in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). METHODS: This study was performed retrospectively on anonymous forty paraffin embedded specimens diagnosed with a primary OSCC. Sections were prepared for p53 immunohistochemical staining and FISH technique evaluation. RESULTS: All studied cases showed a positive nuclear staining with different indices for the p53 protein. Furthermore, statistical analysis showed a significant difference between all histological types of OSCC. In term of P53 immunoreactivity well differentiated OSCC showed the highest, whereas poorly differentiated showed weakest. Regarding chromosome 17 aberrations and p53 gene mutations, Spearman correlation test revealed a statistical significant positive correlation between chromosome 17 abnormalities and p53 gene mutations as well as with the immunohistochemical expression of p53 proteins. Moreover, the positive association between p53 gene mutations and the expression of p53 protein was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: In the light of the previous findings, we concluded that numerical aberrations of chromosome 17 and p53 gene mutations as well as expression of p53 protein have enormous influence on various cellular processes including differentiation and carcinogenesis. Such knowledge provides an easy and simplified approach to prognosis predilection for OSCC.

26241661	Distinguishing Low-Risk Luminal A Breast Cancer Subtypes with Ki-67 and p53 Is More Predictive of Long-Term Survival.	Lee SK, Bae SY, Lee JH, Lee HC, Yi H, Kil WH, Lee JE, Kim SW, Nam SJ.	Overexpression of p53 is the most frequent genetic alteration in breast cancer. Recently, many studies have shown that the expression of mutant p53 differs for each subtype of breast cancer and is associated with different prognoses. In this study, we aimed to determine the suitable cut-off value to predict the clinical outcome of p53 overexpression and its usefulness as a prognostic factor in each subtype of breast cancer, especially in luminal A breast cancer. Approval was granted by the Institutional Review Board of Samsung Medical Center. We analyzed a total of 7,739 patients who were surgically treated for invasive breast cancer at Samsung Medical Center between Dec 1995 and Apr 2013. Luminal A subtype was defined as ER&PR + and HER2- and was further subclassified according to Ki-67 and p53 expression as follows: luminal A (Ki-67-,p53-), luminal A (Ki-67+, p53-), luminal A (Ki-67 -, p53+) and luminal A (Ki-67+, p53+). Low-risk luminal A subtype was defined as negative for both Ki-67 and p53 (luminal A [ki-67-, p53-]), and others subtypes were considered to be high-risk luminal A breast cancer. A cut-off value of 10% for p53 was a good predictor of clinical outcome in all patients and luminal A breast cancer patients. The prognostic role of p53 overexpression for OS and DFS was only significant in luminal A subtype. The combination of p53 and Ki-67 has been shown to have the best predictive power as calculated by the area under curve (AUC), especially for long-term overall survival. In this study, we have shown that overexpression of p53 and Ki-67 could be used to discriminate low-risk luminal A subtype in breast cancer. Therefore, using the combination of p53 and Ki-67 expression in discriminating low-risk luminal A breast cancer may improve the prognostic power and provide the greatest clinical utility.
25767399	Accumulation of p53 is prognostic for aromatase inhibitor resistance in early-stage postmenopausal patients with ER-positive breast cancer.	Jia XQ, Hong Q, Cheng JY, Li JW, Wang YJ, Mo M, Shao ZM, Shen ZZ, Liu GY.	OBJECTIVE: Studies have indicated that p53 protein accumulation exerts an adverse effect on the survival of breast cancer patients; however, the prognostic value of p53 protein accumulation for aromatase inhibitor (AI) resistance in ER-positive breast cancer is uncertain. METHODS: The expression level of p53 protein was detected by immunohistochemistry in primary early-stage ER-positive breast tumor specimens from 293 postmenopausal breast cancer patients who received first-line AI treatment (letrozole, anastrozole, or exemestane) until relapse, and analysis was performed to determine whether expression of p53 protein affected the response to endocrine therapy. RESULTS: Of the 293 invasive ductal carcinomas, 65.4% were positive for p53 protein expression. All patients received AI therapy as first-line treatment until relapse. The 5-year disease-free survival rates in p53-positive and p53-negative patients were 78% and 89%, respectively. Patients with primary breast tumors that had p53 protein accumulation showed significantly more resistance to AI treatment (hazard ratio=1.729, 95% confidence interval=1.038-2.880, P=0.035). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that p53 protein accumulation was helpful in choosing patients who may benefit from AI treatment and is a prognostic marker in ER-positive early-stage breast cancer.
26277488	Prediction of dual agents as an activator of mutant p53 and inhibitor of Hsp90 by docking, molecular dynamic simulation and virtual screening.	Abbasi M, Sadeghi-Aliabadi H, Hassanzadeh F, Amanlou M.	Heat shock protein90s (Hsp90s) play a crucial role in the development of cancer, and their inhibitors are a main target for tumor suppression. P53 also is a tumor suppressor, but in cancer cells, mutations in the p53 gene lead to the inactivation and accumulation of protein. For instance, the ninth p53 cancer mutation, Y220C, destabilizes the p53 core domain. Small molecules have been assumed to bind to Y220C DNA-binding domain and reactivate cellular mutant p53 functions. In this study, one of the mutant p53 activators is suggested as an Hsp90 inhibitor according to a pyrazole scaffold. To confirm a new ligand as a dual agent, molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulations were performed on both proteins (p53 and Hsp90). Molecular dynamic simulations were also conducted to evaluate the obtained results on the other two pyrazole structures, one known as Hsp90 inhibitor and the other as the reported mutant p53 activator. The findings indicate that the new ligand was stable in the active site of both proteins. Finally, a virtual screening was performed on ZINC database, and a set of new dual agents was proposed according to the new ligand scaffold.
25172547	Lipopolysaccharide downregulates the expression of p53 through activation of MDM2 and enhances activation of nuclear factor-kappa B.	Odkhuu E, Mendjargal A, Koide N, Naiki Y, Komatsu T, Yokochi T.	The effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the expression of p53 protein in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells was examined. LPS downregulated the expression of p53 protein 4-24 h after the stimulation. LPS-induced p53 inhibition was restored with pharmacological inhibitors of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). It was also restored by inhibitors of MDM2 activation and proteasome. LPS-induced p53 inhibition corresponded to activation of MDM2. LPS-induced MDM2 activation was prevented by inhibitors of JNK and PI3K. The expression of p65 NF-κB at a late stage after LPS stimulation was downregulated in the presence of a MDM2 inhibitor. Nutlin-3 as a MDM2 inhibitor reduced LPS-induced production of nitric oxide but not tumor necrosis factor-α. Administration of LPS into mice downregulated the in vivo expression of p53 in the livers. Taken together, LPS was suggested to downregulate the expression of p53 via activation of MDM2 and enhance the activation of NF-κB at a late stage.
25828929	Distinct novel quinazolinone exhibits selective inhibition in MGC-803 cancer cells by dictating mutant p53 function.	Zhang GH, Xue WB, An YF, Yuan JM, Qin JK, Pan CX, Su GF.	The mutant p53 proteins and their corresponding cellular response can be manipulated by novel quinazolinone derivatives 4-8 (a-i) in p53 mutant cancer cells. Of the two most potent compounds, 4a exhibited promising broad-spectrum anti-cancer effects, whereas 6c showed selective and exclusive inhibition activity in p53 mutant cancer cell lines but low toxicity to wild-type p53 cancer cell A375 and normal lung fibroblast WI-38 cells. Furthermore, 6c exhibited a more sophisticated mechanism for cell-destructive response by causing S/G2 phase arrest effect and cell size reduction. Compared with the cellular response of 6b and genetic background of cell lines studied, p53 mutation was found to be the key factor and main target for 6c evoked cell-destructive response. Molecular mechanism studies indicated that p53 phosphorylation and acetylation dual-targeting inhibitor 6c exerted anti-cancer activities with a special mechanism in evoking cell apoptosis by arresting mutant p53 function to trigger the deregulation of Cdk2 caused Bim-mediated apoptosis. To the best of our knowledge, 6c is the first quinazolinone derivative to dictate mutant p53 function for apoptotic cell death.
25840370	The cis conformation of proline leads to weaker binding of a p53 peptide to MDM2 compared to trans.	Zhan YA, Ytreberg FM.	The cis and trans conformations of the Xaa-Pro (Xaa: any amino acid) peptide bond are thermodynamically stable while other peptide bonds strongly prefer trans. The effect of proline cis-trans isomerization on protein binding has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, computer simulations were used to calculate the absolute binding affinity for a p53 peptide (residues 17-29) to MDM2 for both cis and trans isomers of the p53 proline in position 27. Results show that the cis isomer of p53(17-29) binds more weakly to MDM2 than the trans isomer, and that this is primarily due to the difference in the free energy cost associated with the loss of conformational entropy of p53(17-29) when it binds to MDM2. The population of cis p53(17-29) was estimated to be 0.8% of the total population in the bound state. The stronger binding of trans p53(17-29) to MDM2 compared to cis may leave a minimal level of p53 available to respond to cellular stress. This study demonstrates that it is feasible to estimate the absolute binding affinity for an intrinsically disordered protein fragment binding to an ordered protein that are in good agreement with experimental results.
26030124	The Lys-Specific Molecular Tweezer, CLR01, Modulates Aggregation of the Mutant p53 DNA Binding Domain and Inhibits Its Toxicity.	Herzog G, Shmueli MD, Levy L, Engel L, Gazit E, Klärner FG, Schrader T, Bitan G, Segal D.	The tumor suppressor p53 plays a unique role as a central hub of numerous cell proliferation and apoptotic pathways, and its malfunction due to mutations is a major cause of various malignancies. Therefore, it serves as an attractive target for developing novel anticancer therapeutics. Because of its intrinsically unstable DNA binding domain, p53 unfolds rapidly at physiological temperature. Certain mutants shift the equilibrium toward the unfolded state and yield high-molecular weight, nonfunctional, and cytotoxic β-sheet-rich aggregates that share tinctorial and conformational similarities with amyloid deposits found in various protein misfolding diseases. Here, we examined the effect of a novel protein assembly modulator, the lysine (Lys)-specific molecular tweezer, CLR01, on different aggregation stages of misfolded mutant p53 in vitro and on the cytotoxicity of the resulting p53 aggregates in cell culture. We found that CLR01 induced rapid formation of β-sheet-rich, intermediate-size p53 aggregates yet inhibited further p53 aggregation and reduced the cytotoxicity of the resulting aggregates. Our data suggest that aggregation modulators, such as CLR01, could prevent the formation of toxic p53 aggregates.
25217104	The p53/mouse double minute 2 homolog complex deregulation in merlin-deficient tumours.	Ammoun S, Schmid MC, Zhou L, Hilton DA, Barczyk M, Hanemann CO.	Deficiency of the tumour suppressor merlin leads to the development of schwannomas, meningiomas and ependymomas occurring spontaneously or as a part of the hereditary disease Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). Merlin loss is also found in a proportion of other cancers like mesothelioma, melanoma, breast cancer and glioblastoma. The tumour suppressor/transcription factor p53 regulates proliferation, survival and differentiation and its deficiency plays a role in the development of many tumours. 53 can be negatively regulated by FAK, PI3K/AKT and MDM2 and possibly positively regulated by merlin in different cell lines. In this study we investigated the role of p53 in merlin-deficient tumours. Using our in vitro model of primary human schwannoma cells we have previously demonstrated that FAK is overexpressed/activated and localises into the nucleus of schwannoma cells increasing proliferation. AKT is strongly activated via platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) - and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) - receptors increasing survival. Here we investigated p53 regulation and its role in proliferation and survival of human primary schwannoma cells using western blotting, immunocytochemistry, immunohistochemistry and proliferation, survival and transcription factor assays. In human primary schwannoma cells p53 was found to be downregulated while MDM2 was upregulated leading to increased cell proliferation and survival. p53 is regulated by merlin involving FAK, AKT and MDM2. Merlin reintroduction into schwannoma cells increased p53 levels and activity, and treatment with Nutlin-3, a drug which increases p53 stability by disrupting the p53/MDM2 complex, decreased tumour growth and reduced cell survival. These findings are important to dissect the mechanisms responsible for the development of merlin-deficient tumours and to identify new therapeutic targets. We suggest that Nutlin-3, possibly in combination with FAK or PI3K inhibitors, can be employed as a novel treatment for schwannoma and other merlin-deficient tumours.
25467851	Zinc deficiency induces apoptosis via mitochondrial p53- and caspase-dependent pathways in human neuronal precursor cells.	Seth R, Corniola RS, Gower-Winter SD, Morgan TJ Jr, Bishop B, Levenson CW.	Previous studies have shown that zinc deficiency leads to apoptosis of neuronal precursor cells in vivo and in vitro. In addition to the role of p53 as a nuclear transcription factor in zinc deficient cultured human neuronal precursors (NT-2), we have now identified the translocation of phosphorylated p53 to the mitochondria and p53-dependent increases in the pro-apoptotic mitochondrial protein BAX leading to a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential as demonstrated by a 25% decrease in JC-1 red:green fluorescence ratio. Disruption of mitochondrial membrane integrity was accompanied by efflux of the apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondria and translocation to the nucleus with a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) after 24h of zinc deficiency. Measurement of caspase cleavage, mRNA, and treatment with caspase inhibitors revealed the involvement of caspases 2, 3, 6, and 7 in zinc deficiency-mediated apoptosis. Down-stream targets of caspase activation, including the nuclear structure protein lamin and polyADP ribose polymerase (PARP), which participates in DNA repair, were also cleaved. Transfection with a dominant-negative p53 construct and use of the p53 inhibitor, pifithrin-μ, established that these alterations were largely dependent on p53. Together these data identify a cascade of events involving mitochondrial p53 as well as p53-dependent caspase-mediated mechanisms leading to apoptosis during zinc deficiency.
25505178	p53 degradation by a coronavirus papain-like protease suppresses type I interferon signaling.	Yuan L, Chen Z, Song S, Wang S, Tian C, Xing G, Chen X, Xiao ZX, He F, Zhang L.	Infection by human coronaviruses is usually characterized by rampant viral replication and severe immunopathology in host cells. Recently, the coronavirus papain-like proteases (PLPs) have been identified as suppressors of the innate immune response. However, the molecular mechanism of this inhibition remains unclear. Here, we provide evidence that PLP2, a catalytic domain of the nonstructural protein 3 of human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), deubiquitinates and stabilizes the cellular oncoprotein MDM2 and induces the proteasomal degradation of p53. Meanwhile, we identify IRF7 (interferon regulatory factor 7) as a bona fide target gene of p53 to mediate the p53-directed production of type I interferon and the innate immune response. By promoting p53 degradation, PLP2 inhibits the p53-mediated antiviral response and apoptosis to ensure viral growth in infected cells. Thus, our study reveals that coronavirus engages PLPs to escape from the innate antiviral response of the host by inhibiting p53-IRF7-IFNβ signaling.
25535325	Hepatitis C virus core protein overcomes H2O2-induced apoptosis by downregulating p14 expression via DNA methylation.	Seo YL, Heo S, Jang KL.	Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is characterized by systemic oxidative stress that is caused by either viral core protein or chronic inflammation. It is well recognized that reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as H2O2 can induce apoptotic cell death and can therefore function as anti-tumorigenic species. However, the detailed mechanisms by which ROS induce apoptotic cell death and HCV copes with the oxidative conditions are largely unknown. In the present study, we found that H2O2 induced apoptotic cell death in p53-positive human hepatocytes, but not in p53-negative human hepatocytes. For this effect, H2O2 upregulated levels of p14, increased ubiquitin-dependent degradation of mouse double minute 2 (MDM2), and reduced the interaction between MDM2 and p53 to prevent p53 degradation, resulting in accumulation of p53 and subsequent activation of p53-dependent apoptotic pathways. Interestingly, HCV core repressed p14 expression via promoter hypermethylation to abolish the potential of H2O2 to activate the p14-MDM2-p53 pathway. As a consequence, HCV core-expressing cells could overcome p53-mediated apoptosis provoked by H2O2. Taken together, HCV core could contribute to hepatocellular carcinoma formation by removing deleterious roles of ROS inducing cell death.
26266944	HCV Infection and Interferon-Based Treatment Induce p53 Gene Transcription in Chronic Hepatitis C Patients.	Świątek-Kościelna B, Kałużna EM, Januszkiewicz-Lewandowska D, Rembowska J, Mozer-Lisewska I, Bereszyńska I, Czubała K, Dziechciowska K, Wysocka-Leszczyńska J, Barcińska D, Wysocki J, Nowak JS.	It is suggested that the tumor suppressor p53 gene, classified as an interferon-stimulated gene, is implicated in the interferon (IFN)-mediated innate immunity against viruses. This study aimed to examine the transcriptional response of the p53 gene to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and IFN-based therapy in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients. The study included 65 CHC patients (HCV genotype 1), treated with pegylated IFN-α and ribavirin, and 51 healthy individuals. p53 gene expression was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Analyses were performed before and at weeks 4 and 12 of treatment. p53 gene expression was significantly upregulated in CHC patients compared with healthy controls and at week 4 of therapy. No significant differences in p53 mRNA expression between rapid virologic responders, complete early virologic responders, and nonresponders were observed. No significant correlation was found between p53 gene expression and viral load. The results obtained indicate that HCV infection and IFN-based treatment induces p53 gene transcription in PBMCs. The p53 gene may therefore play a role in HCV infection but is not directly involved in treatment-induced HCV elimination. Moreover, variations in p53 gene expression do not determine on-treatment response in patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection.
26194454	Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis reveals γ-bisabolene inducing p53-mediated apoptosis of human oral squamous cell carcinoma via HDAC2 inhibition and ERK1/2 activation.	Jou YJ, Chen CJ, Liu YC, Way TD, Lai CH, Hua CH, Wang CY, Huang SH, Kao JY, Lin CW.	γ-Bisabolene, one of main components in cardamom, showed potent in vitro and in vivo anti-proliferative activities against human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). γ-Bisabolene activated caspases-3/9 and decreased mitochondrial memebrane potential, leading to apoptosis of OSCC cell lines (Ca9-22 and SAS), but not normal oral fibroblast cells. Phosphoproteome profiling of OSCC cells treated with γ-bisabolene was identified using TiO2-PDMS plate and LC-MS/MS, then confirmed using Western blotting and real-time RT-PCR assays. Phosphoproteome profiling revealed that γ-bisabolene increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, protein phosphatases 1 (PP1), and p53, as well as decreased the phosphorylation of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) in the process of apoptosis induction. Protein-protein interaction network analysis proposed the involvement of PP1-HDAC2-p53 and ERK1/2-p53 pathways in γ-bisabolene-induced apoptosis. Subsequent assays indicated γ-bisabolene eliciting p53 acetylation that enhanced the expression of p53-regulated apoptotic genes. PP1 inhibitor-2 restored the status of HDAC2 phosphorylation, reducing p53 acetylation and PUMA mRNA expression in γ-bisabolene-treated Ca9-22 and SAS cells. Meanwhile, MEK and ERK inhibitors significantly decreased γ-bisabolene-induced PUMA expression in both cancer cell lines. Notably, the results ascertained the involvement of PP1-HDAC2-p53 and ERK1/2-p53 pathways in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis of γ-bisabolene-treated cells. This study demonstrated γ-bisabolene displaying potent anti-proliferative and apoptosis-inducing activities against OSCC in vitro and in vivo, elucidating molecular mechanisms of γ-bisabolene-induced apoptosis. The novel insight could be useful for developing anti-cancer drugs.
26282181	p53 modulates the activity of the GLI1 oncogene through interactions with the shared coactivator TAF9.	Yoon JW, Lamm M, Iannaccone S, Higashiyama N, Leong KF, Iannaccone P, Walterhouse D.	The GLI1 oncogene and p53 tumor suppressor gene function in an inhibitory loop that controls stem cell and tumor cell numbers. Since GLI1 and p53 both interact with the coactivator TATA Binding Protein Associated Factor 9 (TAF9), we hypothesized that competition between these transcription factors for TAF9 in cancer cells may contribute to the inhibitory loop and directly affect GLI1 function and cellular phenotype. We showed that TAF9 interacts with the oncogenic GLI family members GLI1 and GLI2 but not GLI3 in cell-free pull-down assays and with GLI1 in rhabdomyosarcoma and osteosarcoma cell lines. Removal of the TAF9-binding acidic alpha helical transactivation domain of GLI1 produced a significant reduction in the ability of GLI1 to transform cells. We then introduced a point mutation into GLI1 (L1052I) that eliminates TAF9 binding and a point mutation into GLI3 (I1510L) that establishes binding. Wild-type and mutant GLI proteins that bind TAF9 showed enhanced transactivating and cell transforming activity compared with those that did not. Therefore, GLI-TAF9 binding appears important for oncogenic activity. We then determined whether wild-type p53 down-regulates GLI function by sequestering TAF9. We showed that p53 binds TAF9 with greater affinity than does GLI1 and that co-expression of p53 with GLI1 or GLI2 down-regulated GLI-induced transactivation, which could be abrogated using mutant forms of GLI1 or p53. This suggests that p53 sequesters TAF9 from GLI1, which may contribute to inhibition of GLI1 activity by p53 and potentially impact therapeutic success of agents targeting GLI-TAF9 interactions in cancer.
25832528	[Expressions of ASPP2, iASPP and p53 in cervical cancinoma and the significance].	Ouyang M, Hu Y, Zeng F.	OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of apoptosis stimulating proteins of p53 2 (ASPP2) and inhibitory member of the ASPP family (iASPP) in the occurrence of cervical cancer and the relation between these two proteins and p53. METHODS: We used immunohistochemical method to detect the expression of ASPP2, iASPP, p53 in 51 patients with early cervical cancer tissue, 53 patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) II-III, 48 patients with CIN I and 45 patients with normal cervical tissue. The relation among ASPP2, iASPP and p53 was analyzed. RESULTS: When p53 was negative, the positive expression rate of ASPP2 in the cervical cancer group, the CIN II-III group, the CIN I group and the normal cervix group was gradually increased. There was significant difference between the CIN II-III group or the cervical cancer group and the normal cervix (P<0.05), but no statistical difference was found among the other groups (P>0.05). The positive expression rate of iASPP in the 4 groups gradually reduced, and the difference was significant difference between the cervical cancer group or the CIN II-III group and the normal cervix group (P<0.05). When the p53 was positive, there was no significant change in the expression of ASPP2 and iASPP in every group (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: ASPP2 and iASPP may play an important role in the occurrence of early stage of cervical cancer by regulating the ability of wild type p53 in induction of apoptosis. ASPP2 and iASPP gene might be a potential molecular target for cervical carcinoma.
26442703	R248Q mutation - Beyond p53-DNA binding.	Ng JW, Lama D, Lukman S, Lane DP, Verma CS, Sim AY.	R248 in the DNA binding domain (DBD) of p53 interacts directly with the minor groove of DNA. Earlier nuclear magnetic resonance studies indicated that the R248Q mutation resulted in conformation changes in parts of DBD far from the mutation site. However, how information propagates from the mutation site to the rest of the DBD is still not well understood. We performed a series of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to dissect sterics and charge effects of R248 on p53-DBD conformation: i) wild-type p53 DBD; ii) p53 DBD with an electrically neutral arginine side-chain; iii) p53 DBD with R248A; iv) p53 DBD with R248W and v) p53 DBD with R248Q. Our results agree well with experimental observations of global conformational changes induced by the R248Q mutation. Our simulations suggest that both charge- and sterics are important in the dynamics of the loop (L3) where the mutation resides. We show that helix 2 (H2) dynamics is altered as a result of a change in the hydrogen bonding partner of D281. In turn, neighboring L1 dynamics is altered: in mutants, L1 predominantly adopts the recessed conformation and is unable to interact with the major groove of DNA. We focused our attention the R248Q mutant that is commonly found in a wide range of cancer and observed changes at the zinc-binding pocket that might account for the dominant negative effects of R248Q. Furthermore, in our simulations, the S6/S7 turn was more frequently solvent exposed in R248Q, suggesting that there is a greater tendency of R248Q to partially unfold and possibly lead to an increased aggregation propensity. Finally, based on the observations made in our simulations, we propose strategies for the rescue of R248Q mutants. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
26440706	p53-Based strategy to reduce hematological toxicity of chemotherapy: A proof of principle study.	Ha CS, Michalek JE, Elledge R, Kelly KR, Ganapathy S, Su H, Jenkins CA, Argiris A, Swords R, Eng TY, Karnad A, Crownover RL, Swanson GP, Goros M, Pollock BH, Yuan ZM.	p53 activation is a primary mechanism underlying pathological responses to DNA damaging agents such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Our recent animal studies showed that low dose arsenic (LDA)-induced transient p53 inhibition selectively protected normal tissues from chemotherapy-induced toxicity. Study objectives were to: 1) define the lowest safe dose of arsenic trioxide that transiently blocks p53 activation in patients and 2) assess the potential of LDA to decrease hematological toxicity from chemotherapy. Patients scheduled to receive minimum 4 cycles of myelosuppressive chemotherapy were eligible. For objective 1, dose escalation of LDA started at 0.005 mg/kg/day for 3 days. This dose satisfied objective 1 and was administered before chemotherapy cycles 2, 4, and 6 for objective 2. p53 level in peripheral lymphocytes was measured on day 1 of each cycle by ELISA assay. Chemotherapy cycles 1, 3, and 5 served as the baseline for the subsequent cycles of 2, 4, and 6 respectively. If p53 level for the subsequent cycle was lower (or higher) than the baseline cycle, p53 was defined as "suppressed" (or "activated") for the pair of cycles. Repeated measures linear models of CBC in terms of day, cycle, p53 activity and interaction terms were used. Twenty-six patients treated with 3 week cycle regimens form the base of analyses. The mean white blood cell, hemoglobin and absolute neutrophil counts were significantly higher in the "suppressed" relative to the "activated" group. These data support the proof of principle that suppression of p53 could lead to protection of bone marrow in patients receiving chemotherapy. This trial is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov. Identifier: NCT01428128.
26463327	[Prognostic value of combined expression of Aurora A, p53 and p21 WAF1 in patients after curative resection of non-small cell lung cancer].	Li X, Liu N, Ren P, Cao Q, Wang P, Zhao L, Lu B, Wang P.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of combined expression of Aurora A, Ki-67, p53 and p21 WAF1 in patients after curative resection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Expressions of Aurora A, Ki-67, p53 and p21 WAF1 in 58 tumor samples from resected primary NSCLCs were detected by immunohistochemistry. The correlation of proteins, survival and clinicopathological characteristics was analyzed. RESULTS: The positive rates of Aurora A, Ki-67, p53 and p21 WAF1 expression were 89.7% (52/58), 53.4% (31/58), 46.6% (27/58) and 34.5% (20/58), respectively. Aurora A expression was positively correlated with nodal metastasis (69.2% vs. 37.8%, P = 0.045). The univariable analysis showed that the overall survival (OS) was 75.0%in patients with low Aurora A expression and 46.0% in patients with high Aurora A expression (P = 0.039). The 3-year survival rate was 40.0% in patients with positive expression of Aurora A and p53, 65.0% in the patients with positive expression of Aurora A or p53, and 82.1% in the patients with negative expression of Aurora A and p53 (P = 0.039). The Cox regression model showed that combined expression of Aurora and p53 is an independent factor affecting the prognosis of NSCLC patients (P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the positive expression of Aurora A, Ki-67 and p53 proteins is an unfavorable factor affecting the prognosis for NSCLC patients, and the overexpression of Aurora A is an independent unfavorable factor association with shorter OS in NSCLC patients. Detection of positive Aurora A and p53 expression may be a useful predictive prognostic indicator for NSCLC patients.
26055447	p53-Induced inflammation exacerbates cardiac dysfunction during pressure overload.	Yoshida Y, Shimizu I, Katsuumi G, Jiao S, Suda M, Hayashi Y, Minamino T.	The rates of death and disability caused by severe heart failure are still unacceptably high. There is evidence that the sterile inflammatory response has a critical role in the progression of cardiac remodeling in the failing heart. The p53 signaling pathway has been implicated in heart failure, but the pathological link between p53 and inflammation in the failing heart is largely unknown. Here we demonstrate a critical role of p53-induced inflammation in heart failure. Expression of p53 was increased in cardiac endothelial cells and bone marrow cells in response to pressure overload, leading to up-regulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1) expression by endothelial cells and integrin expression by bone marrow cells. Deletion of p53 from endothelial cells or bone marrow cells significantly reduced ICAM1 or integrin expression, respectively, as well as decreasing cardiac inflammation and ameliorating systolic dysfunction during pressure overload. Conversely, overexpression of p53 in bone marrow cells led to an increase of integrin expression and cardiac inflammation that reduced systolic function. Norepinephrine markedly increased p53 expression in endothelial cells and macrophages. Reducing β2-adrenergic receptor expression in endothelial cells or bone marrow cells attenuated cardiac inflammation and improved systolic dysfunction during pressure overload. These results suggest that activation of the sympathetic nervous system promotes cardiac inflammation by up-regulating ICAM1 and integrin expression via p53 signaling to exacerbate cardiac dysfunction. Inhibition of p53-induced inflammation may be a novel therapeutic strategy for heart failure.
26305274	Valproic Acid Induces the Hyperacetylation of P53, Expression of P53 Target Genes, and Markers of the Intrinsic Apoptotic Pathway in Midorganogenesis Murine Limbs.	Paradis FH, Hales BF.	In utero exposure to valproic acid (VPA), an anticonvulsant and histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), increases the risk of congenital malformations. Although the mechanisms leading to the teratogenicity of VPA remain unsolved, several HDAC inhibitors increase cell death in cancer cell lines and embryonic tissues. Moreover, P53, the master regulator of apoptosis, is an established HDAC target. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of VPA on P53 signaling and markers of apoptosis during midorganogenesis in vitro limb development. Timed-pregnant CD1 mice (gestation day 12) were euthanized; embryonic forelimbs were excised and cultured in vitro for 3, 6, 12, or 24 hr in the presence or absence of VPA or valpromide (VPD), a non-HDACi analog of VPA. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blots were used to assess the expression of candidate genes and proteins involved in P53 signaling and apoptosis. P53 hyperacetylation and a decrease (Survivin/Birc5 and Bcl2) or an increase (p21/Cdkn1a) in the expression of p53 target genes was observed only in VPA-exposed limbs. VPA exposure also triggered an increase in markers of apoptosis and DNA damage; the concentrations of cleaved caspase 9 and caspase 3, cleaved-poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, and γ-H2AX were increased in VPA-exposed limbs. VPD treatment caused a small but significant increase in cleaved caspase 3. Thus, in vitro exposure to an HDACi such as VPA leads to P53 hyperacetylation, enhances the expression of P53 target genes, and triggers an increase in apoptosis that may contribute to teratogenicity.
26296918	p53 immunoexpression in stepwise progression of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and correlation with angiogenesis and cellular proliferation.	Florence ME, Massuda JY, Soares TC, Stelini RF, Poppe LM, Bröcker EB, Metze K, Cintra ML, de Souza EM.	Multistep carcinogenesis involves loss of function of tumor suppressor proteins such as p53 and induction of angiogenesis. Such mechanisms contribute to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma progression and may be interconnected. We aimed to explore p53 immunoexpression in spectral stages of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and correlate expression to both neovascularization and cellular proliferation. We estimated the percentages of immunostained cells for p53 and Ki67 (proliferation marker) in three groups: 23 solar keratoses, 28 superficially invasive squamous cell carcinomas and 28 invasive squamous cell carcinomas. The Chalkley method was used to quantify the microvascular area by neoangiogenesis (CD105) immunomarker in each group. There was no significant difference for rate of p53- and Ki67-positive cells between groups. Significant positive correlation was found between the CD105 microvascular area and the rate of p53 positive cells in superficially invasive squamous cell carcinoma as well as between the rate of p53- and Ki67-positive cells in invasive squamous cell carcinoma. p53 and Ki67 immunoexpression did not increase with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma progression. Neovascularization in the initial stage of invasion and proliferative activity in the frankly invasive stage were both associated with p53 immunoexpression. Loss of p53 tumor suppressor function through progressive steps may be directly involved in skin carcinogenesis.
25964101	Pharmacologically Increasing Mdm2 Inhibits DNA Repair and Cooperates with Genotoxic Agents to Kill p53-Inactivated Ovarian Cancer Cells.	Carrillo AM, Hicks M, Khabele D, Eischen CM.	The Mdm2 oncogene is a negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor and recently identified inhibitor of DNA break repair. Nutlin-3 is a small-molecule inhibitor of Mdm2-p53 interaction that can induce apoptosis in cancer cells through activation of p53. Although this is a promising therapy for those cancers with wild-type p53, half of all human cancers have inactivated p53. Here, we reveal that a previously unappreciated effect of Nutlin is inhibition of DNA break repair, stemming from its ability to increase Mdm2 protein levels. The Nutlin-induced increase in Mdm2 inhibited DNA double-strand break repair and prolonged DNA damage response signaling independent of p53. Mechanistically, this effect of Nutlin required Mdm2 and acted through Nbs1 of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 DNA repair complex. In ovarian cancer cells, where >90% have inactivated p53, Nutlin combined with the genotoxic agents, cisplatin or etoposide, had a cooperative lethal effect resulting in increased DNA damage and apoptosis. Therefore, these data demonstrate an unexpected consequence of pharmacologically increasing Mdm2 levels that when used in combination with genotoxic agents induces synthetic lethality in ovarian cancer cells, and likely other malignant cell types, that have inactivated p53.Data reveal a therapeutically beneficial effect of pharmacologically increasing Mdm2 levels combined with chemotherapeutic agents for malignancies that have lost functional p53.
26497030	The Ras/Raf/Erk Pathway Mediates the Subarachnoid Hemorrhage-Induced Apoptosis of Hippocampal Neurons Through Phosphorylation of p53.	Feng D, Wang B, Ma Y, Shi W, Tao K, Zeng W, Cai Q, Zhang Z, Qin H.	Apoptosis plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of early brain injury (EBI) following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). However, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal apoptosis in EBI after SAH have not been fully elucidated. The present study showed that EBI induced significantly neuronal apoptosis activation of Ras/Raf/Erk signals in hippocampus after SAH. Intracisternal administration of PD98059, an inhibitor of Erk1/2, decreased the hippocampal neuronal apoptosis and alleviated the cognitive deficits induced by SAH. Interestingly, an increase in phosphorylation of p53 was paralleled with p-Erk, and PD98059 also blocked the level of p-p53. In primary cultures, oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) treatment significantly increased p-Erk, p-p53, and apoptosis, which was used to mimic the pathological injury of SAH. Both p53 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and PD98059 reduced the OxyHb-induced apoptosis. Moreover, PD98059 significantly decreased the levels of p-Erk and p-p53; however, p53 siRNA had little effect on the level of p-Erk. Taken together, our study implicates that the Ras/Raf/Erk signals contribute to neuronal death through the phosphorylation of p53 in hippocampus after SAH and also suggests Erk/p53 as a potential target for clinical drug treatment of SAH.
26497680	Mutant p53 confers chemoresistance in non-small cell lung cancer by upregulating Nrf2.	Tung MC, Lin PL, Wang YC, He TY, Lee MC, Yeh SD, Chen CY, Lee H.	Nrf2 is a key transcription factor for genes coding for antioxidants, detoxification enzymes, and multiple drug resistance and it also confers resistance to anticancer drugs. Here, we hypothesized that mutant p53 could upregulate Nrf2 expression at the transcriptional level, thereby conferring cisplatin resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Luciferase reporter assays and real-time PCR analysis indicated that the Nrf2 promoter activity and its mRNA levels were markedly suppressed by wild-type p53, but not by mutant p53. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) further confirmed that wild-type p53 binds at the p53 putative binding site to block Sp1 binding to the Nrf2 promoter and consequently to suppress the Nrf2 promoter activity. The MTT assay indicated that an increase in Nrf2 expression by mutant p53 is responsible for cisplatin resistance. Among the Nrf2 downstream genes, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL contribute more strongly to Nrf2-mediated cisplatin resistance when compared with heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1). Cox regression analysis showed that patients with high-Nrf2, high-Bcl-2, high-Bcl-xL mRNA tumors were more commonly occurred unfavorable response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy than their counterparts. The prognostic significance of Nrf2 mRNA levels on OS and RFS was also observed in patients who have received cisplatin-based chemotherapy, particularly in p53-mutant patients. Collectively, mutant p53 may confer cisplatin resistance via upregulation of Nrf2 expression, and Nrf2 mRNA level may predict chemotherapeutic response and outcomes in NSCLC.
25659035	DNA damage-induced regulatory interplay between DAXX, p53, ATM kinase and Wip1 phosphatase.	Brazina J, Svadlenka J, Macurek L, Andera L, Hodny Z, Bartek J, Hanzlikova H.	Death domain-associated protein 6 (DAXX) is a histone chaperone, putative regulator of apoptosis and transcription, and candidate modulator of p53-mediated gene expression following DNA damage. DAXX becomes phosphorylated upon DNA damage, however regulation of this modification, and its relationship to p53 remain unclear. Here we show that in human cells exposed to ionizing radiation or genotoxic drugs etoposide and neocarzinostatin, DAXX became rapidly phosphorylated in an ATM kinase-dependent manner. Our deletion and site-directed mutagenesis experiments identified Serine 564 (S564) as the dominant ATM-targeted site of DAXX, and immunofluorescence experiments revealed localization of S564-phosphorylated DAXX to PML nuclear bodies. Furthermore, using a panel of human cell types, we identified the p53-regulated Wip1 protein phosphatase as a key negative regulator of DAXX phosphorylation at S564, both in vitro and in cells. Consistent with the emerging oncogenic role of Wip1, its DAXX-dephosphorylating impact was most apparent in cancer cell lines harboring gain-of-function mutant and/or overexpressed Wip1. Unexpectedly, while Wip1 depletion increased DAXX phosphorylation both before and after DNA damage and increased p53 stability and transcriptional activity, knock-down of DAXX impacted neither p53 stabilization nor p53-mediated expression of Gadd45a, Noxa, Mdm2, p21, Puma, Sesn2, Tigar or Wip1. Consistently, analyses of cells with genetic, TALEN-mediated DAXX deletion corroborated the notion that neither phosphorylated nor non-phosphorylated DAXX is required for p53-mediated gene expression upon DNA damage. Overall, we identify ATM kinase and Wip1 phosphatase as opposing regulators of DAXX-S564 phosphorylation, and propose that the role of DAXX phosphorylation and DAXX itself are independent of p53-mediated gene expression.
26148237	Structural basis of how stress-induced MDMX phosphorylation activates p53.	Chen X, Gohain N, Zhan C, Lu WY, Pazgier M, Lu W.	The tumor-suppressor protein p53 is tightly controlled in normal cells by its two negative regulators-the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 and its homolog MDMX. Under stressed conditions such as DNA damage, p53 escapes MDM2- and MDMX-mediated functional inhibition and degradation, acting to prevent damaged cells from proliferating through induction of cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, senescence or apoptosis. Ample evidence suggests that stress signals induce phosphorylation of MDM2 and MDMX, leading to p53 activation. However, the structural basis of stress-induced p53 activation remains poorly understood because of the paucity of technical means to produce site-specifically phosphorylated MDM2 and MDMX proteins for biochemical and biophysical studies. Herein, we report total chemical synthesis, via native chemical ligation, and functional characterization of (24-108)MDMX and its Tyr99-phosphorylated analog with respect to their ability to interact with a panel of p53-derived peptide ligands and PMI, a p53-mimicking but more potent peptide antagonist of MDMX, using FP and surface plasmon resonance techniques. Phosphorylation of MDMX at Tyr99 weakens peptide binding by approximately two orders of magnitude. Comparative X-ray crystallographic analyses of MDMX and of pTyr99 MDMX in complex with PMI as well as modeling studies reveal that the phosphate group of pTyr99 imposes extensive steric clashes with the C-terminus of PMI or p53 peptide and induces a significant lateral shift of the peptide ligand, contributing to the dramatic decrease in the binding affinity of MDMX for p53. Because DNA damage activates c-Abl tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates MDMX at Tyr99, our findings afford a rare glimpse at the structural level of how stress-induced MDMX phosphorylation dislodges p53 from the inhibitory complex and activates it in response to DNA damage.Oncogene advance online publication, 6 July 2015; doi:10.1038/onc.2015.255.
25511708	Sigma 1 Receptor antagonist potentiates the anti-cancer effect of p53 by regulating ER stress, ROS production, Bax levels, and caspase-3 activation.	Happy M, Dejoie J, Zajac CK, Cortez B, Chakraborty K, Aderemi J, Sauane M.	Over the last years, many improvements have been made in the treatment of breast cancer; however, novel and less toxic therapies are still needed, especially for relapsing and chemo-resistant patients. Here, we analyzed the therapeutic potential of p53 and Rimcazole, a Sigma 1 Receptor antagonist. Rimcazole and p53 are being evaluated in preclinical and clinical trials, respectively. While p53 is a promising antitumor therapeutic agent, antagonists of Sigma 1 Receptor also inhibit tumor cell survival and induce apoptosis. Our current study demonstrates for the first time the synergistic effect of p53 in combination with the Sigma 1 Receptor antagonist Rimcazole. Furthermore, we show that shRNA knockdown of Sigma 1 Receptor in combination with p53, lead to a similar synergistic effect, and that this synergistic effect, in breast cancer growth suppression occurs independent of p53 status. Furthermore, this combination treatment induced ER stress, p38 MAPK activation, ROS production, and proteins involved in apoptosis (caspases-3, Bax) in breast cancer cells. Combining these therapeutic anti-cancer molecules provides an innovative approach for potentially treating human breast cancer.
26211519	Rational Tuning of the Electrocatalytic Nanobiointerface for a "Turn-Off" Biofuel-Cell-Based Self-Powered Biosensor for p53 Protein.	Han Y, Chabu JM, Hu S, Deng L, Liu YN, Guo S.	Herein, a novel tunable electrocatalytic nanobiointerface for the construction of a high-sensitivity and high-selectivity biofuel-cell (BFC)-based self-powered biosensor for the detection of transcription factor protein p53 is reported, in which bilirubin oxidase (BOD)/DNA supramolecular modified graphene/platinum nanoparticles hybrid nanosheet (GPNHN) works as a new enhanced material of biocathode to control the attachment of target, and thus tune the electron-transfer process of oxygen reduction for transducing signaling magnification. It is found that in the presence of p53, the strong interaction between the wild-type p53 and its consensus DNA sequence on the electrode surface can block the electron transfer from the BOD to the electrode, thus providing a good opportunity for reducing the electrocatalytic activity of oxygen reduction in the biocathode. This in combination with the glucose oxidation at the carbon nanotube/Meldola's blue/glucose dehydrogenase bioanode can result in a current/or power decrease of BFC in the presence of wild-type p53. The specially designed BFC-based self-powered p53 sensor shows a wide linear range from 1 pM to 1 μM with a detection limit of 1 pM for analyzing wild-type p53. Most importantly, our BFC-based self-powered sensors can detect the concentrations of wild-type p53 in normal and cancer cell lysates without any extensive sample pretreatment/separation or specialized instruments. The present BFC-based self-powered sensor can provide a simple, economical, sensitive, and rapid way for analyzing p53 protein in normal and cancer cells at clinical level, which shows great potential for creating the treatment modalities that capitalize on the concentration variation of the wild-type p53.
26158294	p53 directly activates cystatin D/CST5 to mediate mesenchymal-epithelial transition: a possible link to tumor suppression by vitamin D3.	Hünten S, Hermeking H.	Cystatin D (CST5) encodes an inhibitor of cysteine proteases of the cathepsin family and is directly induced by the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Interestingly, vitamin D3 exerts tumor suppressive effects in a variety of tumor types. In colorectal cancer (CRC) cells CST5 was shown to mediate mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET). Interestingly, vitamin D3 was shown to exert tumor suppressive effects in a variety of tumor types, including colorectal cancer (CRC). We recently performed an integrated genomic and proteomic screen to identify targets of the p53 tumor suppressor in CRC cells. Thereby, we identified CST5 as a putative p53 target gene. Here, we validated and characterized CST5 as a direct p53 target gene. After activation of a conditional p53 allele, CST5 was upregulated on mRNA and protein levels. Treatment with nutlin-3a or etoposide induced CST5 in a p53-dependent manner. These regulations were direct, since ectopic and endogenous p53 occupied a conserved binding site in the CST5 promoter region. In addition, treatment with calcitriol, the active vitamin D3 metabolite, and simultaneous activation of p53 resulted in enhanced CST5 induction and increased repression of SNAIL, an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) inducing transcription factor. Furthermore, CST5 inactivation decreased p53-induced mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) as evidenced by decreased inhibition of SNAIL and of migration by p53. Furthermore, CST5 expression was directly repressed by SNAIL. In summary, these results imply CST5 as an important mediator of tumor suppression by p53 in colorectal cancer. In addition, they suggest that a combined treatment activating p53 and the vitamin D3 pathway may function via induction of CST5.
26178300	The PBRM1 (BAF180) protein is functionally regulated by p53-induced protein degradation in renal cell carcinomas.	Macher-Goeppinger S, Keith M, Tagscherer KE, Singer S, Winkler J, Hofmann TG, Pahernik S, Duensing S, Hohenfellner M, Kopitz J, Schirmacher P, Roth W.	About 40% of clear-cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC) harbor mutations in Polybromo-1 (PBRM1), encoding the BAF180 subunit of a SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. This qualifies PBRM1 as a major cancer gene in ccRCC. The PBRM1 protein alters chromatin structure and its known functions include transcriptional regulation by controlling the accessibility of DNA and influencing p53 transcriptional activity. Since little is known about regulation of PBRM1, we studied possible mechanisms and interaction partners involved in the regulation of PBRM1 expression. Activation of p53 in RCC cells resulted in a marked decrease of PBRM1 protein levels. This effect was abolished by siRNA-mediated down regulation of p53, and transcriptional activity was not crucial for p53-dependent PBRM1 regulation. Pulse-chase experiments determined post-translational protein degradation to be the underlying mechanism for p53-dependent PBRM1 regulation, which was accordingly inhibited by proteasome inhibitors. The effects of p53 activation on PBRM1 expression were confirmed in RCC tissue ex vivo. Our results demonstrate that PBRM1 is a target of p53-induced proteasomal protein degradation and provide further evidence for the influence of PBRM1 on p53 function in RCC tumor cells. Considering the paramount role of p53 in carcinogenesis and the presumptive impact of PBRM1 in RCC development, this novel regulation mechanism might be therapeutically exploited in the future.
26537425	Effect of introducing Aib in a designed helical inhibitor of Hdm2-p53 interaction: A molecular dynamics study.	Chattopadhyay S, Haresh A, Basu G.	Although p53 is an intrinsically disordered protein, upon binding to Hdm2, a short stretch (residues 19-25) comprising the binding epitope assumes a helical backbone. Because the allowed conformational space of α-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) is restricted to only the helical basin, Aib-containing helical mimics of p53 (binding epitope) are expected to inhibit interaction between p53 and Hdm2 with a much stronger affinity than the wild type p53 peptide (binding epitope), due to the entropic advantage associated with Aib. However, the IC50 values for the disruption of p53-Hdm2 interaction by Aib-p53 peptides and wild type p53 peptide were found to be comparable (J. Peptide Res. 2002, 60:88-94). To understand why incorporation of Aib didn't substantially increase Hdm2 affinity of Aib-p53 peptides, a series of molecular dynamics simulations were performed. It was found that despite stabilizing a helical backbone in the unbound state, the Aib residues in Aib-p53 peptide arrested two functionally important side-chains (F19 and W23) in non-productive conformations, resulting in relative side-chain orientations of the binding triad F19-W23-L26 incompatible with the bound conformation. Therefore, although a Aib-induced pre-formed helical peptide backbone in the unbound state is expected to favor binding, the locked side-chain orientations of the binding triad in non-productive modes would disfavor binding. This study shows that when using Aib to design functionally important helical peptides, care must be taken to consider potential interactions between side-chains of neighboring residues and Aib in the unbound state.

26358474	Impact of p53 Status on Radiosensitization of Tumor Cells by MET Inhibition-Associated Checkpoint Abrogation.	Mikami K, Medova M, Nisa L, Francica P, Gluck AA, Tschan MP, Blaukat A, Bladt F, Aebersold DM, Zimmer Y.	Signaling via the MET receptor tyrosine kinase has been implicated in crosstalk with cellular responses to DNA damage. Our group previously demonstrated that MET inhibition in tumor cells with deregulated MET activity results in radiosensitization via downregulation of the ATR-CHK1-CDC25 pathway, a major signaling cascade responsible for intra-S and G2/M cell cycle arrest following DNA damage. Here we aimed at studying the potential therapeutic application of ionizing radiation in combination with a MET inhibitor, EMD-1214063, in p53-deficient cancer cells that harbor impaired G1/S checkpoint regulation upon DNA damage. We hypothesized that upon MET inhibition, p53-deficient cells would bypass both G1/S and G2/M checkpoints, promoting premature mitotic entry with substantial DNA lesions and cell death in a greater extent than p53-proficient cells. Our data suggest that p53-deficient cells are more susceptible to EMD-1214063 and combined treatment with irradiation than wildtype p53 lines as inferred from elevated γH2AX expression and increased cytotoxicity. Furthermore, cell cycle distribution profiling indicates constantly lower G1 and higher G2/M population as well as higher expression of a mitotic marker p-histone H3 following the dual treatment in p53 knockdown isogenic variant, compared to the parental counterpart. IMPLICATIONS: The concept of MET inhibition-mediated radiosensitization enhanced by p53 deficiency is of high clinical relevance, since p53 is frequently mutated in numerous types of human cancer. The current data point for a therapeutic advantage for an approach combining MET targeting along with DNA damaging agents for MET positive/p53 negative tumors.
26523280	The Expression and Correlation of iNOS and p53 in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.	Yang L, Wang Y, Guo L, Wang L, Chen W, Shi B.	Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most prevalent form of oral cancer. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and p53 are associated with a variety of human cancers, but their expression and interaction in OSCC have not been fully explored. In this study, we investigated the expression of iNOS and p53 in OSCC and their correlation with tumor development and prognosis. In addition, we explored the interaction of iNOS and p53 in OSCC. The expression of iNOS and p53 in OSCC was investigated using immunohistochemical method and their interaction was studied using RNAi technique. Our results showed that the expression of both iNOS and p53 was significantly correlated with tumor stages and pathological grade of OSCC (P < 0.05). In contrast, there was no correlation between iNOS and p53 expression and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05). The OSCC survival rate was negatively associated with iNOS expression, but not with p53. A significant increase in the expression of the p53 was observed when iNOS expression was knocked down. The immunoexpression of iNOS is correlated with tumorigenesis and prognosis of OSCC and may serve as a prognostic marker.
25273595	JHDM1B expression regulates ribosome biogenesis and cancer cell growth in a p53 dependent manner.	Penzo M, Casoli L, Pollutri D, Sicuro L, Ceccarelli C, Santini D, Taffurelli M, Govoni M, Brina D, Trerè D, Montanaro L.	Tumors characterized by an intense ribosome biogenesis often display a more aggressive behavior. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis is controlled at several levels, including the epigenetic regulation of the condensation of chromatin portions containing rRNA genes. JHDM1B (Jumonji C histone demethylase 1B) is a histone demethylase able to regulate the accessibility of rRNA genes. In this study, we aimed to define the contribution of JHDM1B expression to the features of breast cancer, a tumor type whose behavior is related to the rate of ribosome biogenesis. We show that, in breast cancer-derived cell lines, the increase in rRNA transcription that follows JHDM1B knock-down is mirrored by an augmented cell proliferation only in p53 compromised cells, while p53 competent cells undergo cellular senescence and death. The latter effect appears to be mediated by a p38-dependent phosphorylation of p53, inducing the expression of p15(Ink4b) and p21(Waf1). In breast cancers, lower JHDM1B expression correlates with an increased size of specifically stained nucleolar organized regions, a morphological parameter directly related to the rate of ribosome biogenesis and with a poorer prognosis. In addition, in tumors lacking the controller function of p53, a lower expression of JHDM1B is associated with an increased tumor size at diagnosis. Altogether, our data indicate that epigenetic activation of rDNA genes induced by JHDM1B depletion is associated with a p53-dependent growth arrest, but may promote cancer cell growth when p53 is lacking.
26030398	p53 checkpoint ablation exacerbates the phenotype of Hinfp dependent histone H4 deficiency.	Ghule PN, Xie RL, Colby JL, Jones SN, Lian JB, Wijnen AJ, Stein JL, Stein GS.	Histone Nuclear Factor P (HINFP) is essential for expression of histone H4 genes. Ablation of Hinfp and consequential depletion of histones alter nucleosome spacing and cause stalled replication and DNA damage that ultimately result in genomic instability. Faithful replication and packaging of newly replicated DNA are required for normal cell cycle control and proliferation. The tumor suppressor protein p53, the guardian of the genome, controls multiple cell cycle checkpoints and its loss leads to cellular transformation. Here we addressed whether the absence of p53 impacts the outcomes/consequences of Hinfp-mediated histone H4 deficiency. We examined mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking both Hinfp and p53. Our data revealed that the reduced histone H4 expression caused by depletion of Hinfp persists when p53 is also inactivated. Loss of p53 enhanced the abnormalities in nuclear shape and size (i.e. multi-lobed irregularly shaped nuclei) caused by Hinfp depletion and also altered the sub-nuclear organization of Histone Locus Bodies (HLBs). In addition to the polyploid phenotype resulting from deletion of either p53 or Hinfp, inactivation of both p53 and Hinfp increased mitotic defects and generated chromosomal fragility and susceptibility to DNA damage. Thus, our study conclusively establishes that simultaneous loss of both Hinfp and the p53 checkpoint is detrimental to normal cell growth and may predispose to cellular transformation.
26556313	Spiro-oxindole derivative 5-chloro-4',5'-diphenyl-3'-(4-(2-(piperidin-1-yl) ethoxy) benzoyl) spiro[indoline-3,2'-pyrrolidin]-2-one triggers apoptosis in breast cancer cells via restoration of p53 function.	Saxena R, Gupta G, Manohar M, Debnath U, Popli P, Prabhakar YS, Konwar R, Kumar S, Kumar A, Dwivedi A.	Breast cancer remains a significant health problem due to the involvement of multiple aberrant and redundant signaling pathways in the tumorigenesis and the development of resistance to the existing therapeutic agents. Therefore, the search for novel chemotherapeutic agents for effective management of breast cancer is still warranted. In an effort to develop new anti-breast cancer agents, we have synthesised and identified novel spiro-oxindole derivative G613 i.e. 5-chloro-4',5'-diphenyl-3'-(4-(2-(piperidin-1-yl) ethoxy) benzoyl) spiro[indoline-3,2'-pyrrolidin]-2-one, which has shown growth inhibitory activity in breast cancer cells. The present study was aimed to explore the mechanism of anti-tumorigenic action of this newly identified spiro-oxindole compound. Compound G613 inhibited the Mdm2 -p53 interaction in breast cancer cells and tumor xenograft. It caused restoration of p53 function by activating its promoter activity, triggering its nuclear accumulation and preventing its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Supportively, molecular docking studies revealed considerable homology in the docking mode of G613 and the known Mdm2 inhibitor Nutlin-3, to p53 binding pocket of Mdm2. The activation of p53 led to upregulation of p53 dependent pro-apototic proteins, Bax, Pumaα and Noxa and enhanced interaction of p53 with bcl2 member proteins thus triggering both transcription- dependent and transcription- independent apoptosis, respectively. Additionally, the compound decreased estrogen receptor activity through sequestration of estrogen receptor α by p53 thereby causing a decreased transcriptional activation and expression of proliferation markers. In conclusion, G613 represents a potent small-molecule inhibitor of the Mdm2-p53 interaction and can serve as a promising lead for developing a new class of anti-cancer therapy for breast cancer patients.
26544897	5-Fluorouracil-induced RNA stress engages a TRAIL-DISC-dependent apoptosis axis facilitated by p53.	Akpinar B, Bracht EV, Reijnders D, Safarikova B, Jelinkova I, Grandien A, Vaculova AH, Zhivotovsky B, Olsson M.	Despite recent advances in targeted therapeutics, administration of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) remains a common clinical strategy for post-surgical treatment of solid tumors. Although it has been proposed that RNA metabolism is disturbed by 5-FU treatment, the key cytotoxic response is believed to be enzymatic inhibition of thymidylate synthase resulting in nucleotide pool disproportions. An operating p53 tumor suppressor signaling network is in many cases essential for the efficiency of chemotherapy, and malfunctions within this system remain a clinical obstacle. Since the fate of chemotherapy-insensitive tumor cells is rarely described, we performed a comparative analysis of 5-FU toxicity in p53-deficient cells and conclude that p53 acts as a facilitator rather than a gatekeeper of cell death. Although p53 can act as a regulator of several cellular stress responses, no rerouting of cell death mode was observed in absence of the tumor suppressor. Thus, the final death outcome of 5-FU-treated p53-/- cells is demonstrated to be caspase-dependent, but due to a slow pace, accumulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species contributes to necrotic characteristics. The oligomerization status of the p53 target gene DR5 is determined as a significant limiting factor for the initiation of caspase activity in an intracellular TRAIL-dependent manner. Using several experimental approaches, we further conclude that RNA-rather than DNA-related stress follows by caspase activation irrespectively of p53 status. A distinct 5-FU-induced stress mechanism is thereby functionally connected to a successive and discrete cell death signaling pathway. Finally, we provide evidence that silencing of PARP-1 function may be an approach to specifically target p53-deficient cells in 5-FU combinatorial treatment strategies. Together, our results disclose details of impaired cell death signaling engaged as a consequence of 5-FU chemotherapy. Obtained data will contribute to the comprehension of factors restraining 5-FU efficiency, and by excluding DNA as the main stress target in some cell types they propose alternatives to currently used and suggested synergistic treatment regimens.
25815421	The ovary is an alternative site of origin for high-grade serous ovarian cancer in mice.	Kim J, Coffey DM, Ma L, Matzuk MM.	Although named "ovarian cancer," it has been unclear whether the cancer actually arises from the ovary, especially for high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), also known as high-grade serous ovarian cancer, the most common and deadliest ovarian cancer. In addition, the tumor suppressor p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in HGSC. However, whether mutated p53 can cause HGSC remains unknown. In this study, we bred a p53 mutation, p53(R172H), into conditional Dicer-Pten double-knockout (DKO) mice, a mouse model duplicating human HGSC, to generate triple-mutant (TKO) mice. Like DKO mice, these TKO mice develop metastatic HGSCs originating from the fallopian tube. Unlike DKO mice, however, even after fallopian tubes are removed in TKO mice, ovaries alone can develop metastatic HGSCs, indicating that a p53 mutation can drive HGSC arising from the ovary. To confirm this, we generated p53(R172H)-Pten double-mutant mice, one of the genetic control lines for TKO mice. As anticipated, these double-mutant mice also develop metastatic HGSCs from the ovary, verifying the HGSC-forming ability of ovaries with a p53 mutation. Our study therefore shows that ovaries harboring a p53 mutation, as well as fallopian tubes, can be a distinct tissue source of high-grade serous ovarian cancer in mice.
25422913	miR-1228 promotes the proliferation and metastasis of hepatoma cells through a p53 forward feedback loop.	Zhang Y, Dai J, Deng H, Wan H, Liu M, Wang J, Li S, Li X, Tang H.	BACKGROUND: The effective mechanisms of microRNAs (miRNAs) functions as oncogenes or tumour suppressors in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are still obscure. Here, we investigated the function and expression of miR-1228 in HCC. METHODS: The role of miR-1228 in HCC was determined by colony formation, transwell, and nude mice xenograft experiments. miR-1228 target gene were identified by EGFP reporter assays, real-time PCR, and western blot analysis. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and real-time PCR analysis are used to examine the regulation of p53. RESULTS: miR-1228 promoted proliferation and metastasis, and facilitated the transition of cell cycle in hepatoma cells. miR-1228 downregulated p53 expression by binding to its 3'UTR. The ectopic expression of p53 abrogated the phenotypes induced by miR-1228. An inverse correlation existed between miR-1228 and p53 expression in hepatoma tissues compared with the adjacent tissues and three hepatoma cell lines. Moreover, we found that p53 suppressed the expression and promoter activity of miR-1228. CONCLUSIONS: miR-1228 functions as an oncogene by promoting cell cycle progression and cell mobility and negatively regulates the expression of p53. p53 downregulation in turn leads to an increase in miR-1228 expression, thereby forming a positive feedback loop that contributes to cancerogenesis in HCC.
25256710	Identification of TRIML2, a novel p53 target, that enhances p53 SUMOylation and regulates the transactivation of proapoptotic genes.	Kung CP, Khaku S, Jennis M, Zhou Y, Murphy ME.	The tumor-suppressor protein p53, encoded by TP53, inhibits tumorigenesis by inducing cell-cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis. Several genetic polymorphisms exist in TP53, including a proline to arginine variant at amino acid 72 (P72 and R72, respectively); this polymorphism alters p53 function. In general, the P72 variant shows increased ability to induce cell-cycle arrest, whereas the R72 variant possesses increased ability to induce apoptosis, relative to P72. At present, the underlying mechanisms for these functional differences are not fully understood. Toward elucidating the molecular basis for these differences, a gene-expression microarray analysis was conducted on normal human fibroblast cells that are homozygous for P72 and R72 variants, along with subclones of these lines that express a p53 short hairpin (shp53). Approximately three dozen genes were identified whose transactivation is affected by the codon 72 polymorphism. One of these is the tripartite-motif family-like 2 (TRIML2) gene, which is preferentially induced by the R72 variant. Importantly, the accumulated data indicate that TRIML2 interacts with p53, and facilitates the modification of p53 with SUMO2. TRIML2 also enhances the ability of p53 to transactivate a subset of proapoptotic target genes associated with prolonged oxidative stress, including PIDD, PIG3 (TP53I3), and PIG6 (PRODH). These data indicate that TRIML2 is part of a feed-forward loop that activates p53 in cells expressing the R72 variant, particularly after prolonged stress.The defined actions of TRIML2, in part, explain the underlying molecular basis for increased apoptotic potential of the R72 variant of p53.
26189250	Prognostic value of INPP4B protein immunohistochemistry in ovarian cancer.	Salmena L, Shaw P, Fans I, McLaughlin, Rosen B, Risch H, Mitchell C, Sun P, Narod SA, Kotsopoulos J.	PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION: Ovarian cancer is associated with poor prognosis and altered protein expression patterns may be useful for identifying patients likely to have poor disease outcomes. The impact of altered INPP4B protein expression on prognosis is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the implication of INPP4B expression changes in a large series of ovarian cancer tissue samples. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tissue microarrays were constructed from 599 epithelial ovarian tumors and stained with antibodies for INPP4B, p53, and PTEN. Proportional hazard models were used to estimate survival hazard ratios (HRs) associated with altered protein expression. RESULTS: Seventy-nine percent of the ovarian cancers demonstrated loss of INPP4B, whereas 53% showed aberrant p53 expression (i.e., complete loss of p53 or over-expression of p53) and 8% showed loss of PTEN. INPP4B was frequently lost in serous and endometrioid cancer subtypes, aberrant p53 expression was most common among serous subtype, and loss of PTEN was most common among endometrioid tumors (p for all three proteins across histologic subtypes ≤ 0.0001). INPP4B loss or aberrant p53 expression were both associated with increased mortality (HR = 1.84; 95% CI 1.27 - 2.68 and HR = 3.10; 95% CI 2.33 - 4.11, respectively); however, in multivariate models, only the relationship with p53 achieved statistical significance (HR = 1.20; 95% CI 0.82 - 1.76 for INPP4B and HR = 1.73; 95% CI 1.28 - 2.34 for p53). Conclusion: The INPP4B protein is frequently lost in serous and endometrioid subtypes of ovarian cancer. A possible prognostic role of INPP4B for endometrioid ovarian tumors requires further evaluation.
24975878	Elevated p53 promotes the processing of miR-18a to decrease estrogen receptor-α in female hepatocellular carcinoma.	Li CL, Yeh KH, Liu WH, Chen CL, Chen DS, Chen PJ, Yeh SH.	The estrogen pathway has long been implicated as a tumor protector in female hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our previous study identified that estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) protein is downregulated in 60% of female HCC cases, via a miR-18a elevation mediated suppression of ERα translation. This study aims to delineate the mechanism underlying the upregulation of miR-18a in female HCC. The analysis of 77 female HCC specimens revealed that miR-18a levels were associated with pre-miR-18a rather than pri-miR-18a levels, suggesting an enhanced processing of pri- to pre-miR-18a. Among a panel of factors involved in microRNA processing, p53 was identified as a novel regulator for miR-18a maturation process. Knockdown of p53 by si-RNA decreased the level of miR-18a, whereas overexpression of either wild-type or mutant p53 increased its level. The association between the elevation of miR-18a and the accumulation of p53, mainly caused by somatic mutations, was confirmed in the clinical specimens of HBV-related female HCC. By analyzing the association with clinicopathological features, activation of this p53/miR-18a pathway mainly occurs in younger or noncirrhosis female HCC patients and associated with a trend of worse overall survival. Therefore, this study demonstrated a novel function of elevated/mutant p53 in regulating the amount of ERα protein through its promoting the biogenesis of miR-18a, which could lead to decrease the tumor-protective function of the estrogen pathway in female hepatocarcinogenesis.
25893985	Inhibition of AKT/FoxO3a signaling induced PUMA expression in response to p53-independent cytotoxic effects of H1: A derivative of tetrandrine.	Zhang YX, Liu XM, Wang J, Li J, Liu Y, Zhang H, Yu XW, Wei N.	PUMA (p53 unregulated modulator of apoptosis), a BH3-only Bcl-2 family member, can be induced by p53-dependent and p53-independent manners. It plays an important role as regulator of cellular apoptosis. Herein, we evaluate the effects of H1 (a derivative of tetrandrine) on induction of PUMA and underlie its potential mechanism in p53-independent cytotoxic response. Anti-proliferative activity and evidently cytotoxic activity of H1 were observed in wild-type and p53 null cells. Further studies demonstrated that H1 resulted in an increase of cleaved PARP, decease of survivin and elevation of p-H2AX. What is more, H1 significantly induced PUMA expression in a concentration- and time-dependent manner and caused an increase of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in p53 null cells. Of note, knockdown of PUMA attenuated cytotoxic activity of H1. Further studies demonstrated that inhibition of AKT/FoxO3a signaling contributed to H1-mediated PUMA induction. Targeted suppression of AKT/FoxO3a signaling by siRNA could overcome H1-mediated PUMA induction. In addition, H1 significantly suppressed NF-κB activity and caused an increase of early apoptotic and late apoptotic cells, and elevated caspase-3 activity. Taken together, we found that inhibition of AKT/FoxO3a signaling may contribute to H1-mediated PUMA induction, suggesting that inhibition of AKT/FoxO3a signaling result in PUMA expression in response to p53-independent cytotoxic effects of H1.
25881545	NKX2-1-mediated p53 expression modulates lung adenocarcinoma progression via modulating IKKβ/NF-κB activation.	Chen PM, Wu TC, Cheng YW, Chen CY, Lee H.	NKX2-1 plays a dual role in lung adenocarcinoma progression, but the underling mechanism is not fully understood. In the present study, we provide evidence that NKX2-1 directly regulates p53 transcription, and in turn, NKX2-1 elevates the mutant p53/NF-Y complex to up-regulate IKKβ transcription in p53-mutant cells, but NKX2-1-mediated wild-type p53 down-regulates IKKβ transcription via decreased Sp1 binding to IKKβ promoter in p53-WT cells. The IKKβ-mediated p65 nuclear localization and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) modulated by the NKX2-1/p53 axis is responsible for soft-agar growth, invasion, and xenograft tumour formation. Among patients, high-IKKβ mRNA tumours had higher prevalence in p53-mutant or nuclear p65 tumours than their counterparts, but not related with NKX2-1 mRNA expression. However, when tumours were divided into p53-WT and p53-mutant subgroups, NKX2-1 mRNA expression was negatively correlated with IKKβ mRNA in p53-WT subgroup, but positively related with IKKβ mRNA expression in p53-mutant subgroup. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis indicated that high NKX2-1 mRNA tumours exhibited poorer overall survival and relapse free survival than low NKX2-1 mRNA tumours in p53-WT subgroup, but the opposite was observed in p53-mutant subgroup. Therefore, we suggest that NKX2-1 as a tumour suppressor or a tumour promoter in lung adenocarcinoma progression is dependent on p53 status.
25799988	Ferroptosis as a p53-mediated activity during tumour suppression.	Jiang L, Kon N, Li T, Wang SJ, Su T, Hibshoosh H, Baer R, Gu W.	Although p53-mediated cell-cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis serve as critical barriers to cancer development, emerging evidence suggests that the metabolic activities of p53 are also important. Here we show that p53 inhibits cystine uptake and sensitizes cells to ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell death, by repressing expression of SLC7A11, a key component of the cystine/glutamate antiporter. Notably, p53(3KR), an acetylation-defective mutant that fails to induce cell-cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis, fully retains the ability to regulate SLC7A11 expression and induce ferroptosis upon reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced stress. Analysis of mutant mice shows that these non-canonical p53 activities contribute to embryonic development and the lethality associated with loss of Mdm2. Moreover, SLC7A11 is highly expressed in human tumours, and its overexpression inhibits ROS-induced ferroptosis and abrogates p53(3KR)-mediated tumour growth suppression in xenograft models. Our findings uncover a new mode of tumour suppression based on p53 regulation of cystine metabolism, ROS responses and ferroptosis.
25992349	Correlation of p53 immunoexpression with DNA ploidy and apoptotic index in subsets of prostate cancer: A marker reiterated in progression and recurrence of prostate cancer.	Bansal A, Gupta A, Saxena S.	BACKGROUND: Prediction of biological behavior in patients of prostate cancer (CaP) is a major challenge as current parameters only partially meet the need for prognostication. p53 as a prognostic indicator has been studied in several human cancers, including breast, lung, and colorectal carcinoma. However, its significance as a predictive biomarker for CaP is less well-studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 125 cases of CaP, 27 cases of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and 25 cases of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Immunohistochemical assessment for p53 nuclear protein was performed. Assessment for apoptotic index and DNA ploidy status by flow cytometry were also done. RESULTS: p53 immunoreactivity was low in organ confined CaP cases having Gleason score ≤3 (P < 0.003). More hormone resistant cases 37 (83%) were aneuploid when compared with hormone sensitive cases 26 (33%) (P < 0.005). 93% of p53 positive cases and none of the p53 negative patient were aneuploid suggesting a significant relation between p53 immunoreactivity and aneuploidy. p53 positivity and DNA aneuploidy, independently, were also predictors of progression and relapse. CONCLUSION: DNA ploidy and p53 positivity go hand in hand and together yield additional prognostic information in CaP. p53 positivity is possibly a late event in carcinogenesis in CaP and a marker of change in biological behavior of CaP.
26056062	Regulation of p53 in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts following hyperosmotic stress.	Lambert IH, Enghoff MS, Brandi ML, Hoffmann EK.	The aim of this project was to analyze the regulation of p53 expression in NIH3T3 fibroblasts under the influence of increasing hyperosmotic stress. Expression of p53 showed a biphasic response pattern in NIH3T3 cells under increasing osmotic stress (337 mOsm to 737 mOsm) with a maximum at 587 mOsm. Under isotonic conditions p53 expression increased after addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 indicating that cellular p53 levels in unperturbed cells is kept low by proteasomal degradation. However, under hypertonic conditions p53 synthesis as well as p53 degradation were significantly reduced and it is demonstrated that the increase in p53 expression observed when tonicity is increased from 337 to 587 mOsm reflects that degradation is more inhibited than synthesis, whereas the decrease in p53 expression at higher tonicities reflects that synthesis is more inhibited than degradation. The activity of the p53 regulating proteins p38 MAP kinase and the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 were studied as a function of increasing osmolarity. MDM2 protein expression was unchanged at all osmolarities, whereas MDM2 phosphorylation (Ser(166)) increased at osmolarities up to 537 mOsm and remained constant at higher osmolarities. Phosphorylation of p38 increased at osmolarities up to 687 mOsm which correlated with an increased phosphorylation of p53 (Ser(15)) and the decreased p53 degradation. Caspase-3 activity increased gradually with hypertonicity and at 737 mOsm both Caspase-3 activity and annexin V binding are high even though p53 expression and activity are low, indicating that initiation of apoptosis under severe hypertonic conditions is not strictly controlled by p53.
25605238	Helicobacter pylori bacteria alter the p53 stress response via ERK-HDM2 pathway.	Bhardwaj V, Noto JM, Wei J, Andl C, El-Rifai W, Peek RM, Zaika AI.	H. pylori infection is the strongest known risk factor for gastric cancer. Inhibition of host tumor suppressor mechanisms by the bacteria underlies the development of this disease. Among the tumor suppressors affected by H. pylori are p53 and E-cadherin, which inhibition has been shown to increase the risk of gastric cancer. In this report, we investigated the interaction between E-cadherin and p53 in H. pylori-infected cells. We found that downregulation of E-cadherin leads to cellular stress and activation of p53. In the setting of H. pylori infection, this mechanism, however, is disrupted. We found that although co-culture of gastric epithelial cells with H. pylori led to downregulation of E-cadherin and cellular stress, it resulted in inhibition of p53, which is mediated by intracellular Erk kinases and HDM2 protein induced by H. pylori. Experimental inhibition of HDM2/p53 interactions restored p53 activity, and decreased survival of infected cells. Collectively, our results revealed that regulation of p53 and E-cadherin is tightly linked through the p53 stress response mechanism that is inhibited by H. pylori via activation of Erk1/2-HDM2-p53 pathway leading to survival of damaged cells. This might be advantageous to the bacteria but may increase the cancer risk.
25647416	Differential salt-induced dissociation of the p53 protein complexes with circular and linear plasmid DNA substrates suggest involvement of a sliding mechanism.	Šebest P, Brázdová M, Fojta M, Pivoňková H.	A study of the effects of salt conditions on the association and dissociation of wild type p53 with different ~3 kbp long plasmid DNA substrates (supercoiled, relaxed circular and linear, containing or lacking a specific p53 binding site, p53CON) using immunoprecipitation at magnetic beads is presented. Salt concentrations above 200 mM strongly affected association of the p53 protein to any plasmid DNA substrate. Strikingly different behavior was observed when dissociation of pre-formed p53-DNA complexes in increased salt concentrations was studied. While contribution from the p53CON to the stability of the p53-DNA complexes was detected between 100 and 170 mM KCl, p53 complexes with circular DNAs (but not linear) exhibited considerable resistance towards salt treatment for KCl concentrations as high as 2 M provided that the p53 basic C-terminal DNA binding site (CTDBS) was available for DNA binding. On the contrary, when the CTDBS was blocked by antibody used for immunoprecipitation, all p53-DNA complexes were completely dissociated from the p53 protein in KCl concentrations≥200 mM under the same conditions. These observations suggest: (a) different ways for association and dissociation of the p53-DNA complexes in the presence of the CTDBS; and (b) a critical role for a sliding mechanism, mediated by the C-terminal domain, in the dissociation process.
26044764	Gradual reduction in rRNA transcription triggers p53 acetylation and apoptosis via MYBBP1A.	Kumazawa T, Nishimura K, Katagiri N, Hashimoto S, Hayashi Y, Kimura K.	The nucleolus, whose primary function is ribosome biogenesis, plays an essential role in p53 activation. Ribosome biogenesis is inhibited in response to cellular stress and several nucleolar proteins translocate from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm, where they activate p53. In this study, we analysed precisely how impaired ribosome biogenesis regulates the activation of p53 by depleting nucleolar factors involved in rRNA transcription or rRNA processing. Nucleolar RNA content decreased when rRNA transcription was inhibited. In parallel with the reduced levels of nucleolar RNA content, the nucleolar protein Myb-binding protein 1 A (MYBBP1A) translocated to the nucleoplasm and increased p53 acetylation. The acetylated p53 enhanced p21 and BAX expression and induced apoptosis. In contrast, when rRNA processing was inhibited, MYBBP1A remained in the nucleolus and nonacetylated p53 accumulated, causing cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase by inducing p21 but not BAX. We propose that the nucleolus functions as a stress sensor to modulate p53 protein levels and its acetylation status, determining cell fate between cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by regulating MYBBP1A translocation.
25691063	EBNA3C regulates p53 through induction of Aurora kinase B.	Jha HC, Yang K, El-Naccache DW, Sun Z, Robertson ES.	In multicellular organisms p53 maintains genomic integrity through activation of DNA repair, and apoptosis. EBNA3C can down regulate p53 transcriptional activity. Aurora kinase (AK) B phosphorylates p53, which leads to degradation of p53. Aberrant expression of AK-B is a hallmark of numerous human cancers. Therefore changes in the activities of p53 due to AK-B and EBNA3C expression is important for understanding EBV-mediated cell transformation. Here we show that the activities of p53 and its homolog p73 are dysregulated in EBV infected primary cells which can contribute to increased cell transformation. Further, we showed that the ETS-1 binding site is crucial for EBNA3C-mediated up-regulation of AK-B transcription. Further, we determined the Ser 215 residue of p53 is critical for functional regulation by AK-B and EBNA3C and that the kinase domain of AK-B which includes amino acid residues 106, 111 and 205 was important for p53 regulation. AK-B with a mutation at residue 207 was functionally similar to wild type AK-B in terms of its kinase activities and knockdown of AK-B led to enhanced p73 expression independent of p53. This study explores an additional mechanism by which p53 is regulated by AK-B and EBNA3C contributing to EBV-induced B-cell transformation.
25888633	HDACi inhibits liposarcoma via targeting of the MDM2-p53 signaling axis and PTEN, irrespective of p53 mutational status.	Ou WB, Zhu J, Eilers G, Li X, Kuang Y, Liu L, Mariño-Enríquez A, Yan Z, Li H, Meng F, Zhou H, Sheng Q, Fletcher JA.	The MDM2-p53 pathway plays a prominent role in well-differentiated liposarcoma (LPS) pathogenesis. Here, we explore the importance of MDM2 amplification and p53 mutation in LPS independently, to determine whether HDACi are therapeutically useful in LPS. We demonstrated that simultaneous knockdown of MDM2 and p53 in p53-mutant LPS lines resulted in increased apoptosis, anti-proliferative effects, and cell cycle arrest, as compared to either intervention alone. HDACi treatment resulted in the dephosphorylation and depletion of MDM2 and p53 without affecting CDK4 and JUN expression, irrespective of p53 mutational status in MDM2-amplified LPS. In control mesothelioma cell lines, HDACi treatment resulted in down-regulation of p53 in the p53 mutant cell line JMN1B, but resulted in no changes of MDM2 and p53 in two mesothelioma lines with normal MDM2 and wild-type p53. HDACi treatment substantially decreased LPS and mesothelioma proliferation and survival, and was associated with upregulation of PTEN and p21, and inactivation of AKT. Our findings indicate that wild-type p53 depletion by HDACi is MDM2 amplification-dependent. These findings underscore the importance of targeting both MDM2 and p53 in LPS and other cancers harboring p53 mutations. Moreover, the pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effect of HDACi warrants further evaluation as a therapeutic strategy in MDM2-amplified LPS.
25784651	p19ARF is a critical mediator of both cellular senescence and an innate immune response associated with MYC inactivation in mouse model of acute leukemia.	Yetil A, Anchang B, Gouw AM, Adam SJ, Zabuawala T, Parameswaran R, van Riggelen J, Plevritis S, Felsher DW.	MYC-induced T-ALL exhibit oncogene addiction. Addiction to MYC is a consequence of both cell-autonomous mechanisms, such as proliferative arrest, cellular senescence, and apoptosis, as well as non-cell autonomous mechanisms, such as shutdown of angiogenesis, and recruitment of immune effectors. Here, we show, using transgenic mouse models of MYC-induced T-ALL, that the loss of either p19ARF or p53 abrogates the ability of MYC inactivation to induce sustained tumor regression. Loss of p53 or p19ARF, influenced the ability of MYC inactivation to elicit the shutdown of angiogenesis; however the loss of p19ARF, but not p53, impeded cellular senescence, as measured by SA-beta-galactosidase staining, increased expression of p16INK4A, and specific histone modifications. Moreover, comparative gene expression analysis suggested that a multitude of genes involved in the innate immune response were expressed in p19ARF wild-type, but not null, tumors upon MYC inactivation. Indeed, the loss of p19ARF, but not p53, impeded the in situ recruitment of macrophages to the tumor microenvironment. Finally, p19ARF null-associated gene signature prognosticated relapse-free survival in human patients with ALL. Therefore, p19ARF appears to be important to regulating cellular senescence and innate immune response that may contribute to the therapeutic response of ALL.
26181202	Targeting Mdmx to treat breast cancers with wild-type p53.	Haupt S, Buckley D, Pang JM, Panimaya J, Paul PJ, Gamell C, Takano EA, Ying Lee Y, Hiddingh S, Rogers TM, Teunisse AF, Herold MJ, Marine JC, Fox SB, Jochemsen A, Haupt Y.	The function of the tumor suppressor p53 is universally compromised in cancers. It is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancers (reviewed). In cases where p53 is not mutated, alternative regulatory pathways inactivate its tumor suppressive functions. This is primarily achieved through elevation in the expression of the key inhibitors of p53: Mdm2 or Mdmx (also called Mdm4) (reviewed). In breast cancer (BrCa), the frequency of p53 mutations varies markedly between the different subtypes, with basal-like BrCas bearing a high frequency of p53 mutations, whereas luminal BrCas generally express wild-type (wt) p53. Here we show that Mdmx is unexpectedly highly expressed in normal breast epithelial cells and its expression is further elevated in most luminal BrCas, whereas p53 expression is generally low, consistent with wt p53 status. Inducible knockdown (KD) of Mdmx in luminal BrCa MCF-7 cells impedes the growth of these cells in culture, in a p53-dependent manner. Importantly, KD of Mdmx in orthotopic xenograft transplants resulted in growth inhibition associated with prolonged survival, both in a preventative model and also in a treatment model. Growth impediment in response to Mdmx KD was associated with cellular senescence. The growth inhibitory capacity of Mdmx KD was recapitulated in an additional luminal BrCa cell line MPE600, which expresses wt p53. Further, the growth inhibitory capacity of Mdmx KD was also demonstrated in the wt p53 basal-like cell line SKBR7 line. These results identify Mdmx growth dependency in wt p53 expressing BrCas, across a range of subtypes. Based on our findings, we propose that Mdmx targeting is an attractive strategy for treating BrCas harboring wt p53.
25655048	Reduced LRP6 expression and increase in the interaction of GSK3β with p53 contribute to podocyte apoptosis in diabetes mellitus and are prevented by green tea.	Peixoto EB, Papadimitriou A, Teixeira DA, Montemurro C, Duarte DA, Silva KC, Joazeiro PP, Lopes de Faria JM, Lopes de Faria JB.	In diabetes mellitus (DM), podocyte apoptosis leads to albuminuria and nephropathy progression. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) is WNT pathway receptor that is involved in podocyte death, adhesion and motility. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) interaction with p53 (GSK3-p53) promotes apoptosis in carcinoma cells. It is unknown if GSK3-p53 contributes to podocyte apoptosis in DM. In experimental DM, green tea (GT) reduces albuminuria by an unknown mechanism. In the present study, we assessed the role of the GSK3β-p53 in podocyte apoptosis and the effects of GT on these abnormalities. In diabetic spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), GT prevents podocyte's p-LRP6 expression reduction, increased GSK3β-p53 and high p53 levels. In diabetic SHR rats, GT reduces podocyte apoptosis, foot process effacement and albuminuria. In immortalized mouse podocytes (iMPs), high glucose (HG), silencing RNA (siRNA) or blocking LRP6 (DKK-1) reduced p-LRP6 expression, leading to high GSK3β-p53, p53 expression, apoptosis and increased albumin influx. GSK3β blockade by BIO reduced GSK3β-p53 and podocyte apoptosis. In iMPs under HG, GT reduced apoptosis and the albumin influx by blocking GSK3β-p53 following the rise in p-LRP6 expression. These effects of GT were prevented by LRP6 siRNA or DKK-1. In conclusion, in DM, WNT inhibition, via LRP6, increases GSK3β-p53 and podocyte apoptosis. Maneuvers that inactivate GSK3β-p53, such as GT, may be renoprotective in DM.
26232254	Relationships between p53 status, apoptosis and induction of micronuclei in different human and mouse cell lines in vitro: Implications for improving existing assays.	Whitwell J, Smith R, Jenner K, Lyon H, Wood D, Clements J, Aschcroft-Hawley K, Gollapudi B, Kirkland D, Lorge E, Pfuhler S, Tanir JY, Thybaud V.	Accumulated evidence has shown that in vitro mammalian cell genotoxicity assays produce high frequencies of "misleading" positive results, i.e. predicted hazard is not confirmed in in vivo and/or carcinogenicity studies [1], raising the question of relevance to human risk assessment. A recent study of micronucleus (MN) induction [2] showed that commonly used p53-deficient rodent cell lines (CHL, CHO and V79) gave a higher frequency of "misleading" positive results with 9 non-DNA reactive, Ames-negative and in vivo negative chemicals [3] than human p53-competent cells (blood lymphocytes, TK6 and HepG2 cell lines). This raised the question of whether these differences were due to p53 status or species origin. This present study compared human versus mouse and p53-competent versus p53-mutated function. The same 9 chemicals were tested for induction of MN in mouse lymphoma L5178Y (mutated p53), human TK6 (functional p53) and WIL2-NS (TK6 related, with mutated p53) cells. Six chemicals provided clear positive increases in MN frequency in at least one cell type. L5178Y cells yielded clear positive responses with more chemicals than either TK6 or WIL2-NS, indicating origin rather than p53 functionality was most relevant. Apoptosis induction (measured via caspase-3/7) was also investigated with clear differences in the timing and extent of apoptosis induction between mouse and human cells noted. With curcumin in TK6 cells, induction of caspase-3/7 activity coincided with MN induction, whereas for L5178Y cells, MN induction occurred in the absence of increased caspase activity. By contrast, with MMS in TK6 cells, MN induction preceded increased caspase-3/7 activity. These data suggest that MN induction by "misleading positive" genotoxins in p53-competent human cell lines may result from apoptosis, whereas in p53-defective rodent cells such as L5178Y, MN induction may be independent of apoptosis.
25422906	New small molecules, ISA27 and SM13, inhibit tumour growth inducing mitochondrial effects of p53.	Sorriento D, Del Giudice C, Bertamino A, Ciccarelli M, Gomez-Monterrey I, Campiglia P, Novellino E, Illario M, Trimarco B, De Luca N, Iaccarino G.	BACKGROUND: p53 is a transcription factor with tumour suppressor properties, which is able to induce mitochondrial apoptosis independently of its transcriptional activity. We recently synthesised two new compounds (ISA27 and SM13), which block p53-MDM2 interaction and induce apoptosis in p53 wild-type (WT) tumour cells. The aim of this study was to verify the effectiveness of these compounds in tumours carrying a mutated form of p53 gene with no transcriptional activity. METHODS: In vitro we evaluated the effectiveness of our compounds in cancer cell lines carrying WT, mutated and null p53 gene. In vivo study was performed in Balb/c nude mice and the mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic signalling was evaluated by western blot. RESULTS: Both ISA27 and SM13 reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in vitro in cells carrying either p53 WT or mutated gene, suggesting that its effect is independent from p53 transcriptional activity. On the contrary, SM13 had no effect in a p53 null cell line. In vivo, ISA27 and SM13 induced cancer cell death in a dose-dependent manner through the activation of the mitochondrial-dependent death signalling in p53-mutated cells. In vivo, SM13 reduced tumour growth. CONCLUSIONS: Our study proposes SM13 as anticancer compound to use for the treatment of p53-dependent tumours, even in the absence of p53 transcriptional activity.
25667224	Yet another function of p53--the switch that determines whether radiation-induced autophagy will be cytoprotective or nonprotective: implications for autophagy inhibition as a therapeutic strategy.	Chakradeo S, Sharma K, Alhaddad A, Bakhshwin D, Le N, Harada H, Nakajima W, Yeudall WA, Torti SV, Torti FM, Gewirtz DA.	The influence of autophagy inhibition on radiation sensitivity was studied in human breast, head and neck, and non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, in cell lines that were either wild type or mutant/null in p53, and in cells where p53 was inducible or silenced. Whereas ionizing radiation promoted autophagy in all tumor cell lines studied, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy and/or genetic silencing of autophagy genes failed to influence sensitivity to radiation in p53 mutant Hs578t breast tumor cells, HN6 head and neck tumor cells, and H358 non-small cell lung cancer cells. The requirement for functional p53 in the promotion of cytoprotective autophagy by radiation was confirmed by the observation that radiation-induced autophagy was nonprotective in p53 null H1299 cells but was converted to the cytoprotective form with induction of p53. Conversely, whereas p53 wild-type HN30 head and neck cancer cells did show sensitization to radiation upon autophagy inhibition, HN30 cells in which p53 was knocked down using small hairpin RNA failed to be sensitized by pharmacological autophagy inhibition. Taken together, these findings indicate that radiation-induced autophagy can be either cytoprotective or nonprotective, a functional difference related to the presence or absence of function p53. Alternatively, these findings could be interpreted to suggest that whereas radiation can induce autophagy independent of p53 status, inhibition of autophagy promotes enhanced radiation sensitivity through a mechanism that requires functional p53. These observations are likely to have direct implications with respect to clinical efforts to modulate the response of malignancies to radiation through autophagy inhibition.
25377899	Identification of antipsychotic drug fluspirilene as a potential p53-MDM2 inhibitor: a combined computational and experimental study.	Patil SP, Pacitti MF, Gilroy KS, Ruggiero JC, Griffin JD, Butera JJ, Notarfrancesco JM, Tran S, Stoddart JW.	The inhibition of tumor suppressor p53 protein due to its direct interaction with oncogenic murine double minute 2 (MDM2) protein, plays a central role in almost 50 % of all human tumor cells. Therefore, pharmacological inhibition of the p53-binding pocket on MDM2, leading to p53 activation, presents an important therapeutic target against these cancers expressing wild-type p53. In this context, the present study utilized an integrated virtual and experimental screening approach to screen a database of approved drugs for potential p53-MDM2 interaction inhibitors. Specifically, using an ensemble rigid-receptor docking approach with four MDM2 protein crystal structures, six drug molecules were identified as possible p53-MDM2 inhibitors. These drug molecules were then subjected to further molecular modeling investigation through flexible-receptor docking followed by Prime/MM-GBSA binding energy analysis. These studies identified fluspirilene, an approved antipsychotic drug, as a top hit with MDM2 binding mode and energy similar to that of a native MDM2 crystal ligand. The molecular dynamics simulations suggested stable binding of fluspirilene to the p53-binding pocket on MDM2 protein. The experimental testing of fluspirilene showed significant growth inhibition of human colon tumor cells in a p53-dependent manner. Fluspirilene also inhibited growth of several other human tumor cell lines in the NCI60 cell line panel. Taken together, these computational and experimental data suggest a potentially novel role of fluspirilene in inhibiting the p53-MDM2 interaction. It is noteworthy here that fluspirilene has a long history of safe human use, thus presenting immediate clinical potential as a cancer therapeutic. Furthermore, fluspirilene could also serve as a structurally-novel lead molecule for the development of more potent, small-molecule p53-MDM2 inhibitors against several types of cancer. Importantly, the combined computational and experimental screening protocol presented in this study may also prove useful for screening other commercially-available compound databases for identification of novel, small molecule p53-MDM2 inhibitors.
26080815	Mutant p53 cooperates with the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex to regulate VEGFR2 in breast cancer cells.	Pfister NT, Fomin V, Regunath K, Zhou JY, Zhou W, Silwal-Pandit L, Freed-Pastor WA, Laptenko O, Neo SP, Bargonetti J, Hoque M, Tian B, Gunaratne J, Engebraaten O, Manley JL, Børresen-Dale AL, Neilsen PM, Prives C.	Mutant p53 impacts the expression of numerous genes at the level of transcription to mediate oncogenesis. We identified vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), the primary functional VEGF receptor that mediates endothelial cell vascularization, as a mutant p53 transcriptional target in multiple breast cancer cell lines. Up-regulation of VEGFR2 mediates the role of mutant p53 in increasing cellular growth in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) culture conditions. Mutant p53 binds near the VEGFR2 promoter transcriptional start site and plays a role in maintaining an open conformation at that location. Relatedly, mutant p53 interacts with the SWI/SNF complex, which is required for remodeling the VEGFR2 promoter. By both querying individual genes regulated by mutant p53 and performing RNA sequencing, the results indicate that >40% of all mutant p53-regulated gene expression is mediated by SWI/SNF. We surmise that mutant p53 impacts transcription of VEGFR2 as well as myriad other genes by promoter remodeling through interaction with and likely regulation of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Therefore, not only might mutant p53-expressing tumors be susceptible to anti VEGF therapies, impacting SWI/SNF tumor suppressor function in mutant p53 tumors may also have therapeutic potential.
25501339	Ad-p53 enhances the sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-468 cells to the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib.	Wang X, Song H, Yu Q, Liu Q, Wang L, Liu Z, Yu Z.	Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 20% of all molecular subtypes of breast cancer. Neither endocrine nor anti-HER2 molecular targeting treatment yield promising results. At present, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, as a single agent, is unable to obtain encouraging results in the treatment of TNBC, even though most of these tumors overexpress EGFR. In the present study, we used recombinant human p53 adenovirus (Ad-p53) and EGFR inhibitor gefitinib to treat the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-468. The combined treatment of gefitinib and Ad-p53 synergistically inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-468 cells; it restrained colony formation, enhanced cellular apoptosis and arrested the cell cycle in vitro, and decreased tumor burden of xenografts in nude mice. Western blot analysis revealed that Ad-p53 and gefitinib in combination significantly downregulated the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (p-Akt) and upregulated caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3, while there were minimal effects on the expression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphorylation of ERK (p-ERK). These results suggest that Ad-p53 may block the PI3K/Akt pathway rather than the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Importantly, wild-type p53 was able to reverse the drug resistance of MDA-MB-468 cells to gefitinib through inactivation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. The apoptotic activity induced by this combined treatment may be regulated by caspase cascade-dependent activation.
26400065	Effect of the knockdown of Cabin1 on p53 in glomerular podocyte.	Wen Y, Zhou P, Liu L, Wang Z, Zhang Y, Liang J.	Calcineurin binding protein 1 (Cabin1) is a natural inhibitor of calcineurin (CN). Moreover, Cabin1 retards tumor cell apoptosis by regulating p53. This study was designed to observe the expression of Cabin1 during podocyte injury, as well as its relationship with p53. Sprague-Dawley rats were used for the establishment of 5/6 nephrectomized rat model. Sham-operated rats underwent ventral laparotomy without nephrectomy. Then, rats were sacrificed at 8 and 12 weeks after nephrectomy. WT-1, a podocyte nuclear protein, was used for indicating the localization of Cabin1 in glomeruli. As tacrolimus protects podocyte via inhibiting AngiotensinII (AngII) induced CN activation. Cultured podocytes were injured by AngII or restored by tacrolimus. The protein expression and localization was detected by western blot or immunofluorescence staining. Cabin1 was knocked down by siRNA in cultured podocytes. In 5/6 nephrectomized rats, the colocalization of Cabin1 and WT-1 became more obviously in podocyte nuclei. Cabin1 protein was markedly increased in rats at 8 and 12 weeks after nephrectomy, as well as in AngII injured podocytes at 48 h (0.99 ± 0.12 in AngII group versus 0.80 ± 0.16 in control group). Cabin1 and p53 colocalized in cultured podocyte nuclei, p53 expression was significantly decreased (0.21 ± 0.05 in siRNA group versus 0.31 ± 0.05 in negative control group) after Cabin1 was being knocked down. In conclusion, Cabin1 expression significantly increases during podocyte injury. Knockdown of Cabin1 induces p53 expression decrease in cultured podocyte. Cabin1 may provide a new target to investigate podocyte injury.
26119940	Role of p14ARF-HDM2-p53 axis in SOX6-mediated tumor suppression.	Wang J, Ding S, Duan Z, Xie Q, Zhang T, Zhang X, Wang Y, Chen X, Zhuang H, Lu F.	Sex-determining region Y box 6 (SOX6) has been described as a tumor-suppressor gene in several cancers. Our previous work has suggested that SOX6 upregulated p21(Waf1/Cip1)(p21) expression in a p53-dependent manner; however, the underlying mechanism has remained elusive. In this study, we confirmed that SOX6 can suppress cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo by stabilizing p53 protein and subsequently upregulating p21. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunocytofluorescence assays demonstrated that SOX6 can promote formation of the p14ARF-HDM2-p53 ternary complex by promoting translocation of p14ARF (p14 alternate reading frame tumor suppressor) to the nucleoplasm, thereby inhibiting HDM2-mediated p53 nuclear export and degradation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with PCR assay proved that SOX6 can bind to a potential binding site in the regulatory region of the c-Myc gene. Furthermore, we confirmed that SOX6 can downregulate the expression of c-Myc, as well as its direct target gene nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1), and that the SOX6-induced downregulation of NPM1 is linked to translocation of p14ARF to the nucleoplasm. Finally, we showed that the highly conserved high-mobility group (HMG) domain of SOX6 is required for SOX6-mediated p53 stabilization and tumor inhibitory activity. Collectively, these results reveal a new mechanism of SOX6-mediated tumor suppression involving p21 upregulation via the p14ARF-HDM2-p53 axis in an HMG domain-dependent manner.Oncogene advance online publication, 29 June 2015; doi:10.1038/onc.2015.234.
26291498	The p53 inhibitor, pifithrin-α, disrupts microtubule, arrests growth, and induces polyploidy in the rainbow trout gill cell line, RTgill-W1.	Zeng F, Yu X, Sherry JP, Dixon B, Duncker BP, Bols NC.	Pifithrin-α (PFT-α) blocks p53-dependent transcription and is an example of the many drugs being developed to target the p53 pathway in humans that could be released into the environment with potential impacts on aquatic animals if they were to become successful pharmaceuticals. In order to understand how p53 drugs might act on fish, the effects of PFT-α on rainbow trout gill epithelial cell line, RTgill-W1, were studied. PFT-α was not cytotoxic to RTgill-W1 in cultures with or without fetal bovine serum (FBS), but at 5.25 μg/ml PFT-α completely arrested proliferation. When FBS was present, PFT-α increased the number of polyploid cells over 12 days. Those results suggest that like in mammals, p53 appears to regulate ploidy in fish. However, several effects were seen that have not been observed with mammalian cells. PFT-α caused a transient rise in the mitotic index and a disruption in cytoskeletal microtubules. These results suggest that in fish cells PFT-α affects microtubules either directly through an off-target action on tubulin or indirectly through an on- target action on p53-regulated transcription.
26125230	The MDM2-inhibitor Nutlin-3 synergizes with cisplatin to induce p53 dependent tumor cell apoptosis in non-small cell lung cancer.	Deben C, Wouters A, Op de Beeck K, van Den Bossche J, Jacobs J, Zwaenepoel K, Peeters M, Van Meerbeeck J, Lardon F, Rolfo C, Deschoolmeester V, Pauwels P.	The p53/MDM2 interaction has been a well-studied target for new drug design leading to the development of the small molecule inhibitor Nutlin-3. Our objectives were to combine Nutlin-3 with cisplatin (CDDP), a well-known activator of the p53 pathway, in a series of non-small cell lung cancer cell lines in order to increase the cytotoxic response to CDDP. We report that sequential treatment (CDDP followed by Nutlin-3), but not simultaneous treatment, resulted in strong synergism. Combination treatment induced p53's transcriptional activity, resulting in increased mRNA and protein levels of MDM2, p21, PUMA and BAX. In addition we report the induction of a strong p53 dependent apoptotic response and induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest. The strongest synergistic effect was observed at low doses of both CDDP and Nutlin-3, which could result in fewer (off-target) side effects while maintaining a strong cytotoxic effect. Our results indicate a promising preclinical potential, emphasizing the importance of the applied treatment scheme and the presence of wild type p53 for the combination of CDDP and Nutlin-3.
24725027	Microbeads mediated oral plasmid DNA delivery using polymethacrylate vectors: an effectual groundwork for colorectal cancer.	Bhatt P, Khatri N, Kumar M, Baradia D, Misra A.	This study was aimed to develop and evaluate p53 polyplex-loaded enteric-coated calcium pectinate microbeads for oral gene delivery as an effective novel alternative for colorectal cancer therapy. Mutation in p53 is the key event in colorectal cancer (CRC) and an important target for the treatment of CRC through gene therapy. Polymethacrylates-based non-viral vectors were evaluated for their ability to complex, protect and transfect p53 (wt) into colon cancer cell line. Polyplexes were formulated by complexation of cationic polymer with anionic pDNA at different N/P ratios. p53 polyplex-loaded calcium pectinate (CP) microbeads were prepared by ionotropic gelation of pectin with calcium chloride and coated with Eudragit® S100. In vitro release studies showed that enteric-coated CP microbeads protected the release of p53 polyplex in upper GIT with less than 10% release. In-vitro cell line studies and in vivo studies in rat showed that polymethacrylate carrier could transfect the pDNA effectively. Results of in vivo gene expression study further confirmed the ability of enteric-coated calcium pectinate microbeads to deliver pDNA specifically to rat colon. Conclusively, enteric-coated calcium pectinate microbeads released p53 polyplex specifically in colon and could serve as an effective alternative for CRC therapy.
25815376	Endosome traffic machinery meets the p53-p21 axis.	Barroso-González J, Thomas G.	SIRT1 regulates p53 transcriptional activation in response to genotoxic insult by deacetylating key lysine residues. We recently identified the multifunctional protein PACS-2 as a SIRT1 inhibitor. After DNA damage, PACS-2 binds and inhibits SIRT1 to increase p53-dependent transactivation of the CDK inhibitor p21 (CDKN1A) and induce cell cycle arrest.
25881688	The expression and clinical significance of ribophorin II (RPN2) in human breast cancer.	Ono M, Tsuda H, Kobayashi T, Takeshita F, Takahashi RU, Tamura K, Akashi-Tanaka S, Moriya T, Yamasaki T, Kinoshita T, Yamamoto J, Fujiwara Y, Ochiya T.	Ribophorin II (RPN2), part of the N-oligosaccharyltransferase complex, is highly expressed in breast cancer stem cells and is associated with tumor metastasis through interaction with mutant p53. The clinicopathological implication of RPN2 expression is undetermined. We examined immunohistochemically the expression levels of RPN2 and p53 in primary breast cancer tissues surgically resected from 218 patients. The correlations of RPN2 expression with the intrinsic subtype defined by hormone receptors (HRs) and HER2, clinicopathological parameters, p53 expression, and patients' clinical outcomes were examined. RPN2 was positive in 139 (64%), and the incidence of RPN2 expression was higher in the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (HR-/HER2-) (65%) and HER2-enriched (HR-/HER2+) subtype (95%) than in the luminal A-like (HR+/HER2-) subtype (58%) (P = 0.0009). RPN2 expression was also correlated with p53 nuclear accumulation (P = 0.04). The RPN2-positive/p53-positive patient group showed significantly poorer prognosis than the RPN2-negative group for disease-free survival (P = 0.05) and for overall survival (P = 0.02). By multivariate analyses, the combination of RPN2 and p53 was not an independent prognostic factor. RPN2 expression was correlated with clinically aggressive features of breast cancer. These data support the further clinical application of anti-RPN2 therapy and the development of personalized medicine.
25912478	P53-dependent miRNAs mediate nitric oxide-induced apoptosis in colonic carcinogenesis.	Li W, Han W, Ma Y, Cui L, Tian Y, Zhou Z, Wang H.	Both miRNAs and nitric oxide (NO) play important roles in colonic inflammation and tumorigenesis. Resistance of colonic epithelial cells to apoptosis may contribute to tumor development. We hypothesized that some miRNAs could increase the resistance of colonic cancer cells to nitric oxide-induced apoptotic cell death. Here we show that NO induced apoptosis and stimulated expression of some miRNAs. Loss of p53 not only blocked NO-induced apoptosis but also dramatically inhibited the expression of NO-related miRNAs, such as miR-34, miR-203, and miR-1301. In addition, blockage of p53-dependent miRNAs significantly reduced NO-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, forced expression of these miRNAs rendered HT-29 cells, which are resistant to apoptosis with mutant p53, more sensitive to NO-induced apoptotic cell death. Most interestingly, in a colitis-associated colon cancer mouse model, the level of miRNAs dropped significantly, accompanied by downregulation of p21, which is a key target gene of p53. In human colorectal cancer samples, the expression of miR-34 significantly correlated with the level of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). We contend that increased NO production may select cells with low levels of p53-dependent miRNAs which contributes to human colonic carcinogenesis and tumor progression.
25980443	Mitochondrial p53 phosphorylation induces Bak-mediated and caspase-independent cell death.	Wang J, Guo W, Zhou H, Luo N, Nie C, Zhao X, Yuan Z, Liu X, Wei Y.	Chemoresistance in cancer has previously been attributed to gene mutations or deficiency. Caspase mutations or Bax deficiency can lead to resistance to cancer drugs. We recently demonstrated that Bak initiates a caspase/Bax-independent cell death pathway. We show that Plumbagin (PL) (5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-napthoquinone), a medicinal plant-derived naphthoquinone that is known to have anti-tumor activity in a variety of models, induces caspase-independent cell death in HCT116 Bax knockout (KO) or MCF-7 Bax knockdown (KD) cells that express wild-type (WT) Bak. The re-expression of Bax in HCT116 Bax KO cells fails to enhance the PL-induced cell death. Additionally, Bak knockdown by shRNA efficiently attenuates PL-induced cell death. These results suggest that PL-induced cell death depends primarily on Bak, not Bax, in these cells. Further experimentation demonstrated that p53 Ser15 phosphorylation and mitochondrial translocation mediated Bak activation and subsequent cell death. Knockdown of p53 or a p53 Ser15 mutant significantly inhibited p53 mitochondrial translocation and cell death. Furthermore, we found that Akt mediated p53 phosphorylation and the subsequent mitochondrial accumulation. Taken together, our data elaborate the role of Bak in caspase/Bax-independent cell death and suggest that PL may be an effective agent for overcoming chemoresistance in cancer cells with dysfunctional caspases.
26080812	Microarray and ChIP-seq data analysis revealed changes in p53-mediated transcriptional regulation in Nutlin-3-treated U2OS cells.	Zhao S, Niu F, Xu CY, Ye L, Bi GB, Chen L, Gong P, Tian G, Nie TH.	Integrative analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) data and microarray data was performed to illustrate the effect of Nutlin‑3 on promoter selectivity and transcriptional regulation by the tumor suppressor p53 in U2OS human osteosarcoma cells. Raw data (accession number, GSE46642) were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus. Differential analyses were performed using package limma of R software. Gene ontology enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses were performed for the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integration Discovery. Integrative analysis of ChIP‑seq data and microarray data were confirmed with ChIP‑Array. A total of 565 DEGs were identified, including 373 upregulated genes and 192 downregulated genes. Genes involved in the p53 signaling pathway, cell cycle, DNA replication, cytokine‑cytokine receptor interaction and melanoma were markedly over‑represented in the DEGs. A total of 39 DEGs were directly regulated by p53 and two were the transcription factors (TFs), E2F2 and HOXA1. E2F2 regulated 25 DEGs, while HOXA1 regulated one DEG. The cell cycle, p53 signaling pathway, melanoma and pathways involved in cancer were enriched in the direct and indirect target genes. Changes in the p53‑binding pattern induced by Nutlin‑3 were described in the present study, which may advance the understanding of the regulatory network of p53 in osteosarcoma and aid in the development of novel therapies.
25670017	The BM2 protein of influenza B virus interacts with p53 and inhibits its transcriptional and apoptotic activities.	Zhang H, Yu H, Wang J, Zhang M, Wang X, Ahmad W, Duan M, Guan Z.	The influenza virus integral membrane proteins BM2 (M2 of influenza B virus) and A/M2 (M2 of influenza A virus) functions as an ion channel, important for virus uncoating in endosomes of virus-infected cells and essential for viral replication. M2 ion channel activity is also required to stimulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation by perturbing ionic concentrations in the Golgi. In the present study, we have investigated further the interaction between BM2 and p53 to confirm our previous studies using yeast two-hybrid assays. The interaction between BM2 and p53 was confirmed by GST pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation assays, and confocal microscopy. Expression of BM2 results in down-regulation of p53 mRNA and protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, we demonstrated that exogenous expression of BM2 functionally blocked p53-mediated transcriptional activity and apoptosis by luciferase reporter assay and TUNEL assay, respectively. Together, the present results indicate that BM2 is able to functionally interact with p53, and provide valuable insights into the modulation of p53 functions by influenza virus.
25753134	P53-Mediated Repression of the Reprogramming in Cloned Bovine Embryos Through Direct Interaction with HDAC1 and Indirect Interaction with DNMT3A.	Ma PJ, Zhang H, Li R, Wang YS, Zhang Y, Hua S.	P53 is a transcriptional activator, regulating growth arrest, DNA repair and apoptosis. We found that the expression level of P53 and the epigenetic profiles were significantly different in bovine somatic cell nuclear transfer embryos from those in vitro fertilization (IVF) embryos. So we inferred that abnormally expression of P53 might contribute to the incomplete reprogramming. Using bovine foetal fibroblasts, we constructed and screened a highly efficient shRNA vector targeting bovine P53 gene and then reconstituted somatic cell nuclear transfer embryos (RNAi-SCNT). The results indicated that expression levels of P53 were downregulated significantly in RNAi-SCNT embryos, and the blastulation rate and the total number of cell increased significantly. Moreover, methylation levels of CpG islands located 5' region of OCT4, NANOG, H19 and IGF2R in RNAi -SCNT embryos were significantly normalized to that IVF embryos, and the methylation levels of genome DNA, H3K9 and H4K5 acetylation levels were also returned to levels similar to the IVF embryos. Differentially expressed genes were identified by microarray, and 28 transcripts were found to be significantly different (> twofolds) in RNAi-SCNT embryos compared to the control nuclear transfer embryos (SCNT). Among the 28 differentially expressed transcripts, just HDAC1 and DNMT3A were closely associated with the epigenetic modifications. Finally, ChIP further showed that P53 might repress the epigenetic reprogramming by regulating HDAC1 directly and DNMT3A indirectly. These findings offer significant references to further elucidate the mechanism of epigenetic reprogramming in SCNT embryos.
25572695	Anti-proliferative effects of polyphenols from pomegranate rind (Punica granatum L.) on EJ bladder cancer cells via regulation of p53/miR-34a axis.	Zhou B, Yi H, Tan J, Wu Y, Liu G, Qiu Z.	miRNAs and their validated miRNA targets appear as novel effectors in biological activities of plant polyphenols; however, limited information is available on miR-34a mediated cytotoxicity of pomegranate rind polyphenols in cancer cell lines. For this purpose, cell viability assay, Realtime quantitative PCR for mRNA quantification, western blot for essential protein expression, p53 silencing by shRNA and miR-34a knockdown were performed in the present study. EJ cell treatment with 100 µg (GAE)/mL PRE for 48 h evoked poor cell viability and caspase-dependent pro-apoptosis appearance. PRE also elevated p53 protein and triggered miR-34a expression. The c-Myc and CD44 were confirmed as direct targets of miR-34a in EJ cell apoptosis induced by PRE. Our results provide sufficient evidence that polyphenols in PRE can be potential molecular clusters to suppress bladder cancer cell EJ proliferation via p53/miR-34a axis.
25982682	Germ cell tumors overexpress the candidate therapeutic target cyclin B1 independently of p53 function.	De Giorgi U, Yuan J, Moroni M, Veronese S, Sartore-Bianchi A, Broggini M, Rosti G, Strebhardt K, Ruffini PA.	Germ cell tumors (GCTs) generally express wild-type p53 protein. Rare p53 mutations may be associated with cisplatin resistance. There is growing interest in the role of cyclins as targets for GCTs. Cyclin B1 is involved in G2/M transition and its overexpression has been reported in tumors carrying nonfunctional p53. Conversely, cyclin B1-specific small interfering RNAs have been shown to dramatically reduce tumor proliferation. We investigated whether a subset of chemotherapy-resistant GCTs overexpressed cyclin B1 as a result of nonfunctional p53, as this would make cyclin B1 a potential therapeutic target. Our data showed that GCTs consistently overexpressed cyclin B1 independently of their responsiveness to chemotherapy or the presence of p53 mutations. Cyclin B1 was overexpressed by GCT cell lines carrying functional p53. Cyclin B1-specific small interfering RNAs only slightly reduced the proliferation of JAR and JEG-3 placental choriocarcinoma cells. Further research into targeting cyclin B1 could provide a novel intervention for GCTs.
26432780	Increased p53 protein expression as a potential predictor of early relapse after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in children with acute myelogenous leukemia.	Mattsson K, Honkaniemi E, Barbany G, Gustafsson B.	Dysregulation of genes involved in the cell cycle such as TP53, P21, P16, and PTEN plays a key role in oncogenesis. We have earlier reported increased expression of the TP53 encoded protein p53, in bone marrow samples from pediatric patients with more aggressive, rare chronic myeloid malignancies. The aim of this study was to investigate protein expression of p53, p21, p16, and PTEN before and after HSCT in pediatric patients with AML and evaluate whether any potential alterations could predict relapse after HSCT. Paraffin-embedded bone marrow samples from 34 pediatric patients with AML were collected retrospectively from time of diagnosis as well as pre- and post-HSCT. IHC was performed on tissue microarrays with antibodies against p53, p21, p16, and PTEN. Study material was analyzed by independent t-tests and nonlinear regression. t-Tests showed a statistical significant difference in p53 (p = 0.010) with overexpression in the group of patients who relapsed compared to the relapse-free patients at >3-6 months post-HSCT. Analysis of p53 protein expression by IHC may be a potential predictor for relapse after HSCT in children with AML.
26462022	Inhibiting bladder tumor growth with a cell penetrating R11 peptide derived from the p53 C-terminus.	Zhang T, Wu K, Ding C, Sun K, Guan Z, Wang X, Hsieh JT, He D, Fan J.	Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) is the most common malignancy of the urinary tract, nearly half of which contains a mutation in TP53 gene. Hence, therapeutic approach by restoring functional p53 protein in cancer cells will be beneficial. Recent studies have demonstrated the inhibition of cancer cell growth by p53 reactivation using a peptide derived from the p53 C-terminus (p53C). However, the outcome of reactivating p53 in controlling bladder cancer development is limited by its efficiency and specificity of peptide delivery, especially in metastatic animal models. Herein, we report that the cell penetrating peptide (polyarginine, R11)-conjugated p53C can exhibit a preferential uptake and growth inhibit of UCB cells expressing either mutant or wild-type TP53 by the activation of p53-dependent pathway. R11-p53C peptide treatment of preclinical orthotopic and metastatic bladder cancer models significantly decreased the tumor burden and increased the lifespan without a significant cytotoxicity. Based on these results, we believe that R11-p53C peptide has therapeutic potential for primary and metastatic bladder cancer, and R11-mediated transduction may be a useful strategy for the therapeutic delivery of large tumor suppressor molecules to tumor cells in vitro and in vivo.
25728512	Rap2a is a novel target gene of p53 and regulates cancer cell migration and invasion.	Wu JX, Zhang DG, Zheng JN, Pei DS.	The p53 transcription factor is a critical regulator of the cell cycle, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Recent evidences suggest that p53 may contribute to the regulation of cell invasion and migration. Rap2a, a member of the small GTPase superfamily, mediates diverse cellular events such as cell adhesion, migration and proliferation through various signaling pathways. In this study, we identify that Rap2a is a novel target of p53 and is induced upon DNA damage in a p53-dependent manner. Upon DNA damage, p53 directly binds to the promoter of Rap2a and activates its transcription. We show that Rap2a is significantly upregulated in many types of tumors. In addition, the ectopic expression of Rap2a enhances the migration and invasive ability of cancer cells and increases activities of matrix metalloproteinase MMP2 and MMP9. In contrast, the inactivation of Rap2a inhibits cell invasion and activities of MMP2 and MMP9. We also show that Rap2a regulates the phosphorylation level of Akt. Collectively, our results show that ectopic expression of Rap2a has a key role in enhancing migration, invasion and metastasis by upregulating p-Akt.
26163983	p53 expression in pleomorphic adenoma of salivary glands: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	Alaizari NA, Tarakji B, Al-Maweri SA, Al-Shamiri HM, Darwish S, Baba F.	There are conflicting data regarding immunohistochemical expression of p53 in pleomorphic adenoma. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine whether p53 expression has a role in the pathogenesis of pleomorphic adenoma.A comprehensive literature search for relevant studies published from 2000 up to end of 2014 was performed using PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library Databases. Only articles in which p53 detected by immunohistochemical staining were included. The meta-analysis was done using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software.Eighteen eligible studies were included in this meta-analysis. Heterogeneity measures showed a statistically significant Cochrane Q value (P-value<0.001). The random effects model showed an effect size of 0.254 with a 95% CI (0.139-0.417). The overall p53 positivity is 25.4%.Mutant p53 has to be detected by more precise techniques to emphasize on its role in development of pleomorphic adenoma of salivary gland.
25936826	P53 suppresses cell proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis of osteosarcoma through inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.	Song R, Tian K, Wang W, Wang L.	To investigate the role of P53 in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma and the possible mechanism involved in it.The anti-proliferative effect of P53 was assessed using the cell counting Kit-8 assay. The migration and invasion potential were analyzed using wound-healing and transwell assays, respectively. The Matrigel capillary tube formation assay was performed to mimic in-vivo angiogenesis. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence were used to observe protein levels and distribution of actin fibers. Finally, S2448p-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) expression was detected on osteosarcoma tissues using immunohistochemistry.Firstly, P53 potently inhibited cell proliferation in osteosarcoma cell line (MG63) and in human normal osteoblasts (hFOB1.19) in vitro at the IC50 ranged from 50 to 500 nmol/l. Then, an inhibitory effect of P53 on metastasis was observed in osteosarcoma cell line MG63, along with the cytoskeletal rearrangements and suppression of the phosphorylation of PI3K downstream factors including AKT and mTOR.These results show that P53 suppresses cell proliferation and angiogenesis of osteosarcoma through inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which might be an effective novel therapeutic candidate against osteosarcoma in the future.
26460892	Curcumin induces p53-independent necrosis in H1299 cells via a mitochondria-associated pathway.	Li F, Chen X, Xu B, Zhou H.	Curcumin has been shown to have various therapeutic and/or adjuvant therapeutic effects on human cancers, as it inhibits cancer cell proliferation and induces apoptosis through p53-dependent molecular pathways. However, numerous cancer cell types bear a mutant p53 gene, and whether curcumin has any therapeutic effects on p53-deficient/mutant cancer cells has remained elusive. The present study sought to determine whether curcumin exerts any anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects on the p53-deficient H1299 human lung cancer cell line via a p53-independent mechanism. An MTT assay and flow cytometric analysis indicated that curcumin significantly decreased cell proliferation and induced necrotic cell death. Western blot analysis of the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions of H1299 cells as well as a fluorometric caspase assay indicated that curcumin-induced necrosis was mitochondria- and caspase-dependent, and resulted in cytochrome c release. Of note, this necrotic cell death was reduced following inhibition of B-cell lymphoma‑2 (Bcl-2)‑associated X protein (Bax) or Bcl‑2 homologous antagonist killer (Bak) as well as overexpression of Bcl-2. In conclusion, the present study suggested that curcumin-induced necrotic cell death was mediated via a p53-independent molecular pathway, which was associated with Bax and Bak translocation, caspase activation and cytochrome c release.
26202022	p53 family members - important messengers in cell death signaling in photodynamic therapy of cancer?	Acedo P, Zawacka-Pankau J.	TP53 is one of the genes most frequently inactivated in cancers. Mutations in TP53 gene are linked to worse prognosis and shorter overall survival of cancer patients. TP53 encodes a critical tumor suppressor, which dictates cell fate decisions upon stress stimuli. As a sensor of cellular stress, p53 is a relevant messenger of cell death signaling in ROS-driven photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer. The significant role of p53 in response to PDT has been reported for several clinically approved photosensitizers. Multiple reports described that wild-type p53 contributes to cell killing upon photodynamic therapy with clinically approved photosensitizers but the mechanism is still not fully understood. This work outlines the diverse functions of p53 family members in cancer cells' susceptibility and resistance to PDT. In summary p53 and p53 family members are emerging as important mediators of cell death signaling in photodynamic therapy of cancer, however the mechanism of cell death provoked during PDT might differ depending on the tissue type and the photosensitizer applied.
25544504	IL-17 induces radiation resistance of B lymphoma cells by suppressing p53 expression and thereby inhibiting irradiation-triggered apoptosis.	Li Q, Xu X, Zhong W, Du Q, Yu B, Xiong H.	p53 is a well-known tumor suppressor. However, the regulatory mechanism(s) for p53 expression in B lymphoma cells, and the possible role of p53 in the development of the radioresistance in tumor cells are largely unknown. A human B lymphoma cell line, Karpas1106 (k1106), was used as a model of radioresistance. Apoptosis of k1106 cells was determined using flow cytometry. Expression of p53 was assessed using real time RT-PCR and western blotting. The results showed that irradiation at 8 Gy induced apoptosis in up to 40% of k1106 cells. At the same time, the irradiation markedly increased IL-6 production of the k1106 cells. When k1106 cells were cocultured with regulatory T cells (Tregs) and irradiated, the rate of apoptotic k1106 cells was significantly reduced, indicating an acquired resistance to irradiation. IL-6 derived from the irradiation-treated k1106 cells induced IL-17 expression in Tregs. The IL-17(+)Foxp3(+) T cells suppressed p53 expression in k1106 cells. Collectively, irradiated k1106 cells induce the expression of IL-17 in Tregs, which interferes with the expression of p53 protein in k1106 cells and thereby represses irradiation-triggered apoptosis in k1106 cells.
26472020	Role of miR-182 in response to oxidative stress in the cell fate of human fallopian tube epithelial cells.	Liu Y, Qiang W, Xu X, Dong R, Karst AM, Liu Z, Kong B, Drapkin RI, Wei JJ.	High grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) is a DNA instable tumor and its precursor is commonly found originating from the fimbriated end of the fallopian tube secretory epithelial (FTSE) cells. The local stresses via ovulation and related inflammation are risks for HGSC. In this study, we examined the cellular and molecular responses of FTSE cells to stress. We found that excess intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in normal FTSE cells upregulated a subset of microRNA expression (defined as ROSmiRs). Most ROSmiRs' expression and function were influenced and regulated by p53, and together they drove the cells into stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS). However, ROS-induced miR-182 is regulated by β-catenin, not by p53. In normal FTSE cells, miR-182 overexpression triggers cellular senescence by p53-mediated upregulation of p21. Conversely, in cells with p53 mutations, miR-182 overexpression no longer enhances p21 but functions as an "Onco-miR". p53 dysfunction is a prerequisite for miR-182-mediated tumorigenesis. In addition, we found that human follicular fluid could significantly induce intracellular ROS in normal FTSE cells. These findings suggest that ROS and p53 mutations may trigger a series of events, beginning with overexpressing miR-182 by ROS and β-catenin, impairing the DNA damage response, promoting DNA instability, bypassing senescence and eventually leading to DNA instable tumors in FTSE cells.
26515559	HSP25 down-regulation enhanced p53 acetylation by dissociation of SIRT1 from p53 in doxorubicin-induced H9c2 cell apoptosis.	Zhang C, Qu S, Wei X, Feng Y, Zhu H, Deng J, Wang K, Liu K, Liu M, Zhang H, Xiao X.	Heat shock proteins (HSPs) play important roles in cellular stress resistance. Previous reports had already suggested that HSP27 played multiple roles in preventing doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Although HSP25 might have biological functions similar to its human homolog HSP27, the mechanism of HSP25 is still unclear in doxorubicin-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. To investigate HSP25 biological function on doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, flow cytometry was employed to analyze cell apoptosis in over-expressing HSP25 H9c2 cells in presence of doxorubicin. Unexpectedly, the H9c2 cells of over-expressing HSP25 have no protective effect on doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Moreover, no detectable interactions were detected by coimmunoprecipitation between HSP25 and cytochrome c, and HSP25 over-expression failed in preventing cytochrome c release induced by doxorubicin. However, down-regulation of endogenous HSP25 by a specific small hairpin RNA aggravates apoptosis in H9c2 cells. Subsequent studies found that HSP25, but not HSP90, HSP70, and HSP20, interacted with SIRT1. Knockdown of HSP25 decreased the interaction between SIRT1 and p53, leading to increased p53 acetylation on K379, up-regulated pro-apoptotic Bax protein expression, induced cytochrome c release, and triggered caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation. These findings indicated a novel mechanism by which HSP25 regulated p53 acetylation through dissociation of SIRT1 from p53 in doxorubicin-induced H9c2 cell apoptosis.
26431211	P53 Contributes to Cisplatin Induced Renal Oxidative Damage via Regulating P66shc and MnSOD.	Yuan Y, Wang H, Wu Y, Zhang B, Wang N, Mao H, Xing C.	Cisplatin is widely used to treat malignancies. However, its major limitation is the development of dose-dependent nephrotoxicity. The precise mechanisms of cisplatin-induced kidney damage remain unclear. Previous study demonstrated the central role of mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) in the pathogenesis of cisplatin nephrotoxicity. The purpose of this study was to explore the mechanism of mtROS regulation in cisplatin nephrotoxicity.p53, MnSOD and p66shc were detected at mRNA and protein levels by qPCR and western blot in HK2 cells. mtROS levels were determined by DCFDA and MitoSOX staining. Cell viability and cell apoptosis were accessed by CCK-8 assay, TUNEL assay and flow cytometry, respectivesly. siRNAs were used to knock down p53 and p66shc expression and subsequent changes were observed. In vivo assays using a mouse model of cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury were used to validate the in vitro results.In HK2 cells, cisplatin exposure decreased the MnSOD and increased the expression of p53 and p66shc. MnTBAP, a MnSOD mimic, blocked cisplatin-induced the generation of mtROS and cell injury. P66shc and p53 siRNAs rendered renal cells resistant to cisplatin-induced mtROS production and cell death. Furthermore, knockdown of p53 restored MnSOD and inhibiting p66shc. Consistent with these results, we revealed that p53 inhibitor reduced cisplatin-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis by regulating MnSOD and p66shc in the kidney of cisplatin-treated mice.Our study identifies activation of p53 signalling as a potential strategy for reducing the nephrotoxicity associated with cisplatin treatments and, as a result, broadens the therapeutic window of this chemotherapeutic agent.
26540407	The p53 tumor suppressor protein protects against chemotherapeutic stress and apoptosis in human medulloblastoma cells.	Waye S, Naeem A, Choudhry MU, Parasido E, Tricoli L, Sivakumar A, Mikhaiel JP, Yenugonda V, Rodriguez OC, Karam SD, Rood BR, Avantaggiati ML, Albanese C.	Medulloblastoma (MB), a primitive neuroectodermal tumor, is the most common malignant childhood brain tumor and remains incurable in about a third of patients. Currently, survivors carry a significant burden of late treatment effects. The p53 tumor suppressor protein plays a crucial role in influencing cell survival in response to cellular stress and while the p53 pathway is considered a key determinant of anti-tumor responses in many tumors, its role in cell survival in MB is much less well defined. Herein, we report that the experimental drug VMY-1-103 acts through induction of a partial DNA damage-like response as well induction of non-survival autophagy. Surprisingly, the genetic or chemical silencing of p53 significantly enhanced the cytotoxic effects of both VMY and the DNA damaging drug, doxorubicin. The inhibition of p53 in the presence of VMY revealed increased late stage apoptosis, increased DNA fragmentation and increased expression of genes involved in apoptosis, including CAPN12 and TRPM8, p63, p73, BIK, EndoG, CIDEB, P27Kip1 and P21cip1. These data provide the groundwork for additional studies on VMY as a therapeutic drug and support further investigations into the intriguing possibility that targeting p53 function may be an effective means of enhancing clinical outcomes in MB.
25698149	p53 status identifies triple-negative breast cancer patients who do not respond to adjuvant chemotherapy.	Coradini D, Biganzoli E, Ardoino I, Ambrogi F, Boracchi P, Demicheli R, Daidone MG, Moliterni A.	Genomic analysis and protein expression assimilate triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) with basal-like breast tumors. TNBCs, however, have proved to encompass also tumors with normal-like phenotype and known to have favorable prognosis and to respond to chemotherapy. In a recent paper, we have provided evidence that p53 status is able to subdivide TNBCs into two distinct subgroups with different outcome, and consistent with basal- and normal-like phenotypes. Based on this finding, we explored the contribution of p53 status in predicting the response to adjuvant CMF or CMF followed doxorubicin chemotherapy of a group of TNBC patients. Results indicated that TNBC patients with a p53-positive tumor had a shorter relapse-free and overall survival than patients carrying a p53-negative TNBC, corroborating our hypothesis about the relationship between TNBC phenotype (basal-like versus normal-like) and p53 status as predictor of response to anthracycline/CMF-based chemotherapy.
25803193	PRIMA-1Met induces apoptosis in Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia cells independent of p53.	Sobhani M, Abdi J, Manujendra SN, Chen C, Chang H.	PRIMA-1Met has shown promising preclinical activity in various cancer types. However, its effect on Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia (WM) cells as well as its exact mechanism of action is still elusive. In this study, we evaluated the anti- tumor activity of PRIMA-1Met alone and in combination with dexamethasone or bortezomib in WM cell lines and primary samples. Treatment of WM cells with PRIMA-1Met resulted in induction of apoptosis, inhibition of migration and suppression of colony formation. Upon PRIMA-1Met treatment, p73 was upregulated and Bcl-xL was down-regulated while no significant change in expression of p53 was observed. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of p53 in WM cell line did not influence the PRIMA-1Met-induced apoptotic response whereas silencing of p73 inhibited latter response in WM cells. Importantly, combined treatment of BCWM-1 cells with PRIMA-1Met and dexamethasone or bortezomib induced synergistic reduction in cell survival. Our study provides insights into the mechanisms of anti-WM activity of PRIMA-1Met and supports further clinical evaluation of PRIMA-1Met as a potential novel therapeutic intervention in WM.
25877751	JARID1B modulates lung cancer cell proliferation and invasion by regulating p53 expression.	Shen X, Zhuang Z, Zhang Y, Chen Z, Shen L, Pu W, Chen L, Xu Z.	Although three therapeutic modalities (surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy) have been established, long-term survival for lung cancer patients is still generally poor. Until now, the mechanisms of lung cancer genesis remain elusive. The JARID1B is a histone demethylase that has been proposed as oncogene in several types of human cancer, but its clinical significance and functional role in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain unclear. In present study, we found that JARID1B was overexpressed in lung cancer cell lines and lung cancer tissues but not in normal lung tissues. The proliferation and invasive potential of lung cancer cells was significantly increased by ectopic expression of JARID1B. Contrarily, RNA interference targeting JARID1B in lung cancer cells significantly decreased the proliferation and invasive potential of cells. Moreover, we also found that the expression of p53 was modulated by JARID1B. Overexpressed JARID1B cell exhibited greatly decreased p53 expression, whereas silencing of JARID1B expression dramatically increased p53 expression at both the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. Inhibition of p53 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) reversed the shJARID1B-induced suppression of proliferation and invasion. Our results collectively suggested that JARID1B expressed in lung cancer played a role in lung cancer cells proliferation and invasion, which may be partly associated with the p53 expression.
25879755	Wip1 deficiency impairs haematopoietic stem cell function via p53 and mTORC1 pathways.	Chen Z, Yi W, Morita Y, Wang H, Cong Y, Liu JP, Xiao Z, Rudolph KL, Cheng T, Ju Z.	Wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (Wip1) negatively regulates several tumour suppressor and DNA damage response pathways. However, the impact of Wip1 on haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) homeostasis and aging remains unknown. Here we show that Wip1 is highly expressed in HSCs but decreases with age. Wip1-deficient (Wip1(-/-)) mice exhibited multifaceted HSC aging phenotypes, including the increased pool size and impaired repopulating activity. Deletion of p53 rescued the multilineage repopulation defect of Wip1(-/-) HSCs without affecting cellular senescence or apoptosis, indicating that the Wip1-p53 axis regulates HSC differentiation in a manner independent of conventional p53 pathways. However, p53 deletion did not influence the increased HSC pool size in Wip1(-/-) mice. Interestingly, the expansion of HSCs in Wip1(-/-) mice was due to an mTORC1-mediated HSC proliferation. Thus, our study reveals a mechanism of stem cell aging, in which distinct effects of p53 and mTORC1 pathways on HSC aging are governed by Wip1.
26587974	Mutant p53 induces EZH2 expression and promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition by disrupting p68-Drosha complex assembly and attenuating miR-26a processing.	Jiang FZ, He YY, Wang HH, Zhang HL, Zhang J, Yan XF, Wang XJ, Che Q, Ke JQ, Chen Z, Tong H, Zhang YL, Wang FY, Li YR, Wan XP.	The tumor suppressor p53 and the transcriptional repressor Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) have both been implicated in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor metastasis via their impacts on microRNA expression. Here, we report that mutant p53 (mutp53) promotes EMT in endometrial carcinoma (EC) by disrupting p68-Drosha complex assembly. Overexpression of mutp53 has the opposite effect of wild-type p53 (WTp53), repressing miR-26a expression by reducing pri-miR-26a-1 processing in p53-null EC cells. Re-expression of miR-26a in mutp53 EC cells decreases cell invasion and promotes mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET). Rescuing miR-26a expression also inhibits EZH2, N-cadherin, Vimentin, and Snail expression and induces E-cadherin expression both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, patients with higher serum miR-26a levels have a better survival rate. These results suggest that p53 gain-of-function mutations accelerate EC tumor progression and metastasis by interfering with Drosha and p68 binding and pri-miR-26a-1 processing, resulting in reduced miR-26a expression and EZH2 overexpression.
26439195	Ectopic AP4 expression induces cellular senescence via activation of p53 in long-term confluent retinal pigment epithelial cells.	Wang Y, Wong MM, Zhang X, Chiu SK.	When cells are grown to confluence, cell-cell contact inhibition occurs and drives the cells to enter reversible quiescence rather than senescence. Confluent retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells exhibiting contact inhibition was used as a model in this study to examine the role of overexpression of transcription factor AP4, a highly expressed transcription factor in many types of cancer, in these cells during long-term culture. We generated stable inducible RPE cell clones expressing AP4 or AP4 without the DNA binding domain (DN-AP4) and observed that, when cultured for 24 days, RPE cells with a high level of AP4 exhibit a large, flattened morphology and even cease proliferating; these changes were not observed in DN-AP4-expressing cells or non-induced cells. In addition, AP4-expressing cells exhibited senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. We demonstrated that the induced cellular senescence was mediated by enhanced p53 expression and that AP4 regulates the p53 gene by binding directly to two of the three E-boxes present on the promoter of the p53 gene. Moreover, we showed that serum is essential for AP4 in inducing p53-associated cellular senescence. Collectively, we showed that overexpression of AP4 mediates cellular senescence involving in activation of p53 in long-term post-confluent RPE cells.
26575021	Expression profiling reveals transcriptional regulation by Fbxw7/mTOR pathway in radiation-induced mouse thymic lymphomas.	Snijders AM, Liu Y, Su L, Huang Y, Mao JH.	The tumor suppressor gene FBXW7 is deleted and mutated in many different types of human cancers. FBXW7 primarily exerts its tumor suppressor activity by ubiquitinating different oncoproteins including mTOR. Here we used gene transcript profiling to gain a deeper understanding of the role of FBXW7 in tumor development and to determine the influence of mTOR inhibition by rapamycin on tumor transcriptome and biological functions. In comparison to tumors from p53 single heterozygous (p53+/-) mice, we find that radiation-induced thymic lymphomas from Fbxw7/p53 double heterozygous (Fbxw7+/-p53+/-) mice show significant deregulation of cholesterol metabolic processes independent of rapamycin treatment, while cell cycle related genes were upregulated in tumors from placebo treated Fbxw7+/-p53+/- mice, but not in tumors from rapamycin treated Fbxw7+/-p53+/- mice. On the other hand, tumors from rapamycin treated Fbxw7+/-p53+/- mice were enriched for genes involved in the integrated stress response, an adaptive mechanism to survive in stressful environments. Finally, we demonstrated that the Fbxw7 gene signatures identified in mouse tumors significantly overlap with FBXW7 co-expressed genes in human cancers. Importantly these common FBXW7 gene signatures between mouse and human are predictive for disease-free survival in human colon, breast and lung adenocarcinoma cancer patients. These results provide novel insights into the role of FBXW7 in tumor development and have identified a number of potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
26259609	Etoposide Induces Necrosis Through p53-Mediated Antiapoptosis in Human Kidney Proximal Tubule Cells.	Kwon HK, Shin HJ, Lee JH, Park SH, Kwon MC, Panneerselvam S, Lee CG, Kim SG, Kim JH, Choi S.	The p53 protein is an important transcription factor that modulates signaling pathways for both cell death and survival. Its antiapoptotic mechanisms that correlate with necrotic and apoptotic cell death are not well understood. Here, we report that etoposide promotes progression of the DNA damage response as well as necrotic morphological changes including plasma membrane rupture using carbon nanotube-tipped/atomic force microscopy (CNT/AFM) probes in human kidney proximal tubule (HK-2) cells. Inhibition of p53 abrogated cell cycle arrest and led to a decrease in the expression levels of repair proteins that were induced by DNA damage. Mitochondrial biogenesis and cytosolic production of reactive oxygen species were also reduced after p53 inhibition; the latter change induced mitochondrial superoxide accumulation and mitochondrial damage, which triggered the activation of caspase 3. Inhibition of p53 also led to a loss of cell adhesion and converted necrotic cell death to apoptotic cell death, with appreciable cell shrinkage and appearance of apoptotic bodies that were observed using CNT/AFM probes. Thus, our study demonstrated that p53 protects against apoptosis, and leads to etoposide-induced necrosis. These results are expected to aid in the understanding of mechanism of antiapoptosis and its relationship to cell death.
26576741	p53/PUMA expression in human pulmonary fibroblasts mediates cell activation and migration in silicosis.	Wang W, Liu H, Dai X, Fang S, Wang X, Zhang Y, Yao H, Zhang X, Chao J.	Phagocytosis of SiO2 into the lung causes an inflammatory cascade that results in fibroblast proliferation and migration, followed by fibrosis. Clinical evidence has indicated that the activation of alveolar macrophages by SiO2 produces rapid and sustained inflammation characterized by the generation of monocyte chemotactic protein 1, which, in turn, induces fibrosis. However, the details of events downstream of monocyte chemotactic protein 1 activity in pulmonary fibroblasts remain unclear. Here, to elucidate the role of p53 in fibrosis induced by silica, both the upstream molecular mechanisms and the functional effects on cell proliferation and migration were investigated. Experiments using primary cultured adult human pulmonary fibroblasts led to the following results: 1) SiO2 treatment resulted in a rapid and sustained increase in p53 and PUMA protein levels; 2) the MAPK and PI3K pathways were involved in the SiO2-induced alteration of p53 and PUMA expression; and 3) RNA interference targeting p53 and PUMA prevented the SiO2-induced increases in fibroblast activation and migration. Our study elucidated a link between SiO2-induced p53/PUMA expression in fibroblasts and cell migration, thereby providing novel insight into the potential use of p53/PUMA in the development of novel therapeutic strategies for silicosis treatment.
26161442	LIF is a new p53 negative regulator.	Liu J, Yu H, Hu W.	Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a cytokine that belongs to the interleukin-6 family, regulates multiple important biological functions. Recently, we found that LIF is an important negative regulator of p53 in human colorectal cancer cells. LIF negatively regulates p53 protein levels and functions by activation of the Stat3 signaling pathway, which in turn induces the expression of ID1, the helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein inhibitor of differentiation and DNA binding. ID1 increases MDM2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels to accelerate p53 protein degradation. Overexpression of LIF increases chemoresistance of cultured colorectal cancer cells and colorectal xenograft tumors in a largely p53-dependent manner. Furthermore, LIF is overexpressed in a large percentage of human colorectal cancer specimens and LIF overexpression is associated with a poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. Our study revealed a new role of LIF in tumorigenesis through regulation of the p53 signaling pathway.
25643152	Alpha-enolase is upregulated on the cell surface and responds to plasminogen activation in mice expressing a ∆133p53α mimic.	Sawhney S, Hood K, Shaw A, Braithwaite AW, Stubbs R, Hung NA, Royds JA, Slatter TL.	The p53 protein is a master regulator of the stress response. It acts as a tumor suppressor by inducing transcriptional activation of p53 target genes, with roles in apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and metabolism. The discovery of at least 12 isoforms of p53, some of which have tumor-promoting properties, has opened new avenues of research. Our previous work studied tumor phenotypes in four mouse models with different p53 backgrounds: wild-type p53, p53 null, mutant p53 lacking the proline domain (mΔpro), and a mimic for the human Δ133p53α p53 isoform (Δ122p53). To identify the major proteins affected by p53 function early in the response to DNA damage, the current study investigated the entire proteome of bone marrow, thymus, and lung in the four p53 models. Protein extracts from untreated controls and those treated with amsacrine were analyzed using two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis. In the bone marrow, reactive proteins were universally decreased by wild-type p53, including α-enolase. Further analysis of α-enolase in the p53 models revealed that it was instead increased in Δ122p53 hematopoietic and tumor cell cytosol and on the cell surface. Alpha-enolase on the surface of Δ122p53 cells acted as a plasminogen receptor, with tumor necrosis factor alpha induced upon plasminogen stimulation. Taken together, these data identified new proteins associated with p53 function. One of these proteins, α-enolase, is regulated differently by wild-type p53 and Δ122p53 cells, with reduced abundance as part of a wild-type p53 response and increased abundance with Δ122p53 function. Increased cell surface α-enolase on Δ122p53 cells provides a possible explanation for the model's pro-inflammatory features and suggests that p53 isoforms may direct an inflammatory response by increasing the amount of α-enolase on the cell surface.
26444285	Long Noncoding RNA MEG3 Interacts with p53 Protein and Regulates Partial p53 Target Genes in Hepatoma Cells.	Zhu J, Liu S, Ye F, Shen Y, Tie Y, Zhu J, Wei L, Jin Y, Fu H, Wu Y, Zheng X.	Maternally Expressed Gene 3 (MEG3) encodes a lncRNA which is suggested to function as a tumor suppressor. Previous studies suggested that MEG3 functioned through activation of p53, however, the functional properties of MEG3 remain obscure and their relevance to human diseases is under continuous investigation. Here, we try to illuminate the relationship of MEG3 and p53, and the consequence in hepatoma cells. We find that transfection of expression construct of MEG3 enhances stability and transcriptional activity of p53. Deletion analysis of MEG3 confirms that full length and intact structure of MEG3 are critical for it to activate p53-mediated transactivation. Interestingly, our results demonstrate for the first time that MEG3 can interact with p53 DNA binding domain and various p53 target genes are deregulated after overexpression of MEG3 in hepatoma cells. Furthermore, results of qRT-PCR have shown that MEG3 RNA is lost or reduced in the majority of HCC samples compared with adjacent non-tumorous samples. Ectopic expression of MEG3 in hepatoma cells significantly inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis. In conclusion, our data demonstrates that MEG3 functions as a tumor suppressor in hepatoma cells through interacting with p53 protein to activate p53-mediated transcriptional activity and influence the expression of partial p53 target genes.
25767724	Expression of p53 target genes in the early phase of long-term potentiation in the rat hippocampal CA1 area.	Pustylnyak VO, Lisachev PD, Shtark MB.	Gene expression plays an important role in the mechanisms of long-term potentiation (LTP), which is a widely accepted experimental model of synaptic plasticity. We have studied the expression of at least 50 genes that are transcriptionally regulated by p53, as well as other genes that are related to p53-dependent processes, in the early phase of LTP. Within 30 min after Schaffer collaterals (SC) tetanization, increases in the mRNA and protein levels of Bax, which are upregulated by p53, and a decrease in the mRNA and protein levels of Bcl2, which are downregulated by p53, were observed. The inhibition of Mdm2 by nutlin-3 increased the basal p53 protein level and rescued its tetanization-induced depletion, which suggested the involvement of Mdm2 in the control over p53 during LTP. Furthermore, nutlin-3 caused an increase in the basal expression of Bax and a decrease in the basal expression of Bcl2, whereas tetanization-induced changes in their expression were occluded. These results support the hypothesis that p53 may be involved in transcriptional regulation during the early phase of LTP. We hope that the presented data may aid in the understanding of the contribution of p53 and related genes in the processes that are associated with synaptic plasticity.
25663901	Combination of interventional adenovirus-p53 introduction and ultrasonic irradiation in the treatment of liver cancer.	Qi JS, Wang WH, Li FQ.	The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the combination of interventional adenovirus-p53 (Ad-p53) introduction and ultrasonic irradiation (CIAIUI) treatment for liver cancer, including evaluating the Ad-p53 transfection efficiency and the impact of the p53 gene on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloprotein 2 (MMP2) protein expression levels. Ad-p53 was arterially infused into the hepatic carcinoma via the interventional introduction of the hepatic tumor-bearing artery (IIHTBA) or the CIAIUI. Serum VEGF levels were determined by performing an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; immunohistochemical analysis was used to identify the expression levels of intratumoral p53, MMP2 and VEGF; and western blot analysis was used to determine the impact of different Ad-p53 administration methods on the expression of wild-type p53. The wild-type p53 expression level was significantly higher in the p53-treated group compared with the control group, and the p53 expression level in the CIAIUI group was significantly higher compared with the non-irradiation group. The CIAIUI could significantly reduce the serum VEGF levels. The two delivery methods caused a reduction in the intratumoral VEGF and MMP2 expression levels, and the effects of CIAIUI were most obvious. Ad-p53 infusion via IIHTBA promoted the protein expression levels of p53, however, it inhibited the protein expression levels of MMP2 and VEGF, indirectly indicating that the gene may inhibit the growth of liver cancer. Therefore, CIAIUI therapy exhibited an overall improved therapeutic effect compared with the more simple IIHTBA therapy.
26079153	CRKL oncogene is downregulated by p53 through miR-200s.	Tamura M, Sasaki Y, Kobashi K, Takeda K, Nakagaki T, Idogawa M, Tokino T.	Tumor suppressive miRNAs that target oncogenes are frequently downregulated in cancers, and this downregulation leads to oncogene pathway activation. Thus, tumor suppressive miRNAs and their target oncogenes have been proposed as useful targets in cancer treatment. miR-200 family downregulation has been reported in cancer progression and metastasis. The miR-200 family consists of two gene clusters, miR-200b/200a/429 and miR-200c/141, which are located on human chromosomes 1 and 12, respectively. Here, we identified that p53 response elements are located around both clusters of the miR-200 family and confirmed that miR-200s are transcriptional targets of the p53 family. In silico analyses of miRNA targets established the CRKL oncogene as a potential target for miR-200b/200c/429. Moreover, miR-200b/200c/429 inhibited CRKL mRNA and protein expression by directly targeting its 3'-UTR region. Importantly, endogenous CRKL expression was decreased in cancer cells through the introduction of p53 family and endogenous p53 activation. Moreover, the downregulation of CRKL by siRNA inhibited cancer cell growth. The Oncomine database demonstrates that CRKL is overexpressed in a subset of cancer types. Furthermore, CRKL is significantly overexpressed in primary breast cancer tissues harboring mutant TP53. Our results demonstrate that the p53 target miR-200b/200c/429 miRNAs are negative regulators of the CRKL oncogene.
26451959	Prognostic Role of Serum Antibody Immunity to p53 Oncogenic Protein in Ovarian Cancer: A Systematic Review and a Meta-Analysis.	Garziera M, Montico M, Bidoli E, Scalone S, Sorio R, Giorda G, Lucia E, Toffoli G.	Serum p53 autoantibodies (p53-AAbs) are the product of an endogenous immune response against p53 overexpression driven by the ovarian tumour. The p53-AAbs are detectable only in a subset of patients. To date, the evidence of an association between the presence of p53-AAbs and ovarian cancer outcomes has been poorly investigated.A systematic literature search was performed to identify eligible studies investigating the association of serum p53-AAbs and overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS). Associations between presence of serum p53-AAbs and baseline tumour characteristics were also evaluated. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed to estimate the prognostic impact of serum p53-AAbs. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed.A total of 583 patients (7 studies) for OS and 356 patients (4 studies) for DFS were included in the meta-analysis. Presence of p53-AAbs was not associated to OS (pooled uni- multivariate HR = 1.09; 95% CI: 0.55-2.16), and a large heterogeneity was found. When only multivariate HRs were pooled together (4 studies), presence of p53-AAbs was significantly associated to a better OS (pooled HR = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.40-0.81), and no significant heterogeneity was observed. A reduced DFS was associated to p53-AAbs (pooled uni- multivariate HR = 1.37; 95% CI: 0.83-2.25), though not significantly and with a moderate heterogeneity.The prognostic significance of serum p53-AAbs in ovarian cancer was diverging according to uni or multivariate models used. Since the results of this work were based on only few investigations, large prospective studies are needed to better define the role of antibody immunity against p53.
26251638	Etoposide induces cell death via mitochondrial-dependent actions of p53.	Jamil S, Lam I, Majd M, Tsai SH, Duronio V.	BACKGROUND: Etoposide has been used clinically in cancer treatment, as well as in numerous research studies, for many years. However, there is incomplete information about its exact mechanism of action in induction of cell death. METHODS: Etoposide was compared at various concentrations to characterize the mechanisms by which it induces cell death. We investigated its effects on mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and focused on both transcriptional and non-transcriptional responses of p53. RESULTS: Here we demonstrate that treatment of MEFs with higher concentrations of etoposide induce apoptosis and activate the transcription-dependent functions of p53. Interestingly, lower concentrations of etoposide also induced apoptosis, but without any evidence of p53-dependent transcription up-regulation. Treatment of MEFs with an inhibitor of p53, Pifithrin-α, blocked p53-dependent transcription but failed to rescue the cells from etoposide-induced apoptosis. Treatment with PES, which inhibits the mitochondrial arm of the p53 pathway inhibited etoposide-induced cell death at all concentrations tested. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that transcriptional functions of p53 are dispensable for etoposide-induced cell death. The more recently characterized effects of p53 at the mitochondria, likely involving its interactions with BCL-2 family members, are thus more important for etoposide's actions.
26081755	Whole-genome cartography of p53 response elements ranked on transactivation potential.	Tebaldi T, Zaccara S, Alessandrini F, Bisio A, Ciribilli Y, Inga A.	BACKGROUND: Many recent studies using ChIP-seq approaches cross-referenced to trascriptome data and also to potentially unbiased in vitro DNA binding selection experiments are detailing with increasing precision the p53-directed gene regulatory network that, nevertheless, is still expanding. However, most experiments have been conducted in established cell lines subjected to specific p53-inducing stimuli, both factors potentially biasing the results. RESULTS: We developed p53retriever, a pattern search algorithm that maps p53 response elements (REs) and ranks them according to predicted transactivation potentials in five classes. Besides canonical, full site REs, we developed specific pattern searches for non-canonical half sites and 3/4 sites and show that they can mediate p53-dependent responsiveness of associated coding sequences. Using ENCODE data, we also mapped p53 REs in about 44,000 distant enhancers and identified a 16-fold enrichment for high activity REs within those sites in the comparison with genomic regions near transcriptional start sites (TSS). Predictions from our pattern search were cross-referenced to ChIP-seq, ChIP-exo, expression, and various literature data sources. Based on the mapping of predicted functional REs near TSS, we examined expression changes of thirteen genes as a function of different p53-inducing conditions, providing further evidence for PDE2A, GAS6, E2F7, APOBEC3H, KCTD1, TRIM32, DICER, HRAS, KITLG and TGFA p53-dependent regulation, while MAP2K3, DNAJA1 and potentially YAP1 were identified as new direct p53 target genes. CONCLUSIONS: We provide a comprehensive annotation of canonical and non-canonical p53 REs in the human genome, ranked on predicted transactivation potential. We also establish or corroborate direct p53 transcriptional control of thirteen genes. The entire list of identified and functionally classified p53 REs near all UCSC-annotated genes and within ENCODE mapped enhancer elements is provided. Our approach is distinct from, and complementary to, existing methods designed to identify p53 response elements. p53retriever is available as an R package at: http://tomateba.github.io/p53retriever .
25819102	Post-trauma administration of the pifithrin-α oxygen analog improves histological and functional outcomes after experimental traumatic brain injury.	Yang LY, Chu YH, Tweedie D, Yu QS, Pick CG, Hoffer BJ, Greig NH, Wang JY.	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Programmed death of neuronal cells plays a crucial role in acute and chronic neurodegeneration following TBI. The tumor suppressor protein p53, a transcription factor, has been recognized as an important regulator of apoptotic neuronal death. The p53 inactivator pifithrin-α (PFT-α) has been shown to be neuroprotective against stroke. A previous cellular study indicated that PFT-α oxygen analog (PFT-α (O)) is more stable and active than PFT-α. We aimed to investigate whether inhibition of p53 using PFT-α or PFT-α (O) would be a potential neuroprotective strategy for TBI. To evaluate whether these drugs protect against excitotoxicity in vitro, primary rat cortical cultures were challenged with glutamate (50mM) in the presence or absence of various concentrations of the p53 inhibitors PFT-α or PFT-α (O). Cell viability was estimated by LDH assay. In vivo, adult Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to controlled cortical impact (CCI, with 4m/s velocity, 2mm deformation). Five hours after injury, PFT-α or PFT-α (O) (2mg/kg, i.v.) was administered to animals. Sensory and motor functions were evaluated by behavioral tests at 24h after TBI. The p53-positive neurons were identified by double staining with cell-specific markers. Levels of mRNA encoding for p53-regulated genes (BAX, PUMA, Bcl-2 and p21) were measured by reverse transcription followed by real time-PCR from TBI animals without or with PFT-α/PFT-α (O) treatment. We found that PFT-α(O) (10 μM) enhanced neuronal survival against glutamate-induced cytotoxicity in vitro more effectively than PFT-α (10 μM). In vivo PFT-α (O) treatment enhanced functional recovery and decreased contusion volume at 24h post-injury. Neuroprotection by PFT-α (O) treatment also reduced p53-positive neurons in the cortical contusion region. In addition, p53-regulated PUMA mRNA levels at 8h were significantly reduced by PFT-α (O) administration after TBI. PFT-α (O) treatment also decreased phospho-p53 positive neurons in the cortical contusion region. Our data suggest that PFT-α (O) provided a significant reduction of cortical cell death and protected neurons from glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in vitro, as well as improved neurological functional outcome and reduced brain injury in vivo via anti-apoptotic mechanisms. The inhibition of p53-induced apoptosis by PFT-α (O) provides a useful tool to evaluate reversible apoptotic mechanisms and may develop into a novel therapeutic strategy for TBI.
26462838	An integrative transcriptomic analysis reveals p53 regulated miRNA, mRNA, and lncRNA networks in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.	Gong Z, Yang Q, Zeng Z, Zhang W, Li X, Zu X, Deng H, Chen P, Liao Q, Xiang B, Zhou M, Li X, Li Y, Xiong W, Li G.	It has been reported that p53 dysfunction is closely related to the carcinogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Recently, an increasing body of evidence has indicated that microRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in p53-associated signaling pathways and, in addition to mRNAs, form a complex regulation network to promote tumor occurrence and progression. The aim of this study was to elucidate the p53-regulated miRNAs, mRNAs, and lncRNAs and their regulating networks in NPC. Firstly, we overexpressed p53 in the NPC cell line HNE2 and performed transcriptomic gene expression profiling (GEP) analysis, which included miRNAs, mRNAs, and lncRNAs, using microarray technology at 0, 12, 24, and 48 h after transfection. There were 38 miRNAs (33 upregulated and 5 downregulated), 2107 mRNAs (296 upregulated and 1811 downregulated), and 1190 lncRNAs (133 upregulated and 1057 downregulated) that were significantly dysregulated by p53. Some of the dysregulated molecules were confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Then, we integrated previously published miRNAs, mRNAs, and lncRNAs GEP datasets from NPC biopsies to investigate the expression of these p53 regulated molecules and found that 7 miRNAs, 218 mRNAs, and 101 lncRNAs regulated by p53 were also differentially expressed in NPC tissues. Finally, p53-regulated miRNA, mRNA, and lncRNA networks were constructed using bioinformatics methods. These miRNAs, mRNAs, and lncRNAs may participate in p53 downstream signaling pathways and play important roles in the carcinogenesis of NPC. Thorough investigations of their biological functions and regulating relationships will provide a novel view of the p53 signaling pathway, and the restoration of p53 functioning or its downstream gene regulating network is potentially of great value in treating NPC patients.
26148435	Arsenic-induced S phase cell cycle lengthening is associated with ROS generation, p53 signaling and CDC25A expression.	Pozo-Molina G, Ponciano-Gómez A, Rivera-González GC, Hernández-Zavala A, Garrido E.	Cellular response to arsenic is strongly dependent on p53 functional status. Primarily arresting the cell cycle in G1 or G2/M phases, arsenic treatment also induces an increase in the S-phase time in wild-type p53 cells. In contrast, cells with a non-functional p53 display only a subtle increase in the S phase, indicating arsenic differentially affects the cell cycle depending on p53 status. Importantly, it has been reported that arsenic induces reactive oxygen species (ROS), a process counteracted by p53. To evaluate the participation of p53 in the lengthening of the S phase and the connection between the transient cell cycle arrest and oxidative stress, we evaluated the cell response to arsenic in MCF-7 and H1299 cells, and analyzed p53's role as a transcription factor in regulating genes involved in ROS reduction and S phase transition. Herein, we discovered that arsenic induced an increase in the population of S phase cells that was dependent on the presence and transcriptional activity of p53. Furthermore, for the first time, we demonstrate that arsenic activates p53-dependent transcription of ROS detoxification genes, such as SESN1, and by an indirect mechanism involving ATF3, genes that could be responsible for the S phase cell cycle arrest, such as CDC25A.
25362854	Mcph1/Brit1 deficiency promotes genomic instability and tumor formation in a mouse model.	Liang Y, Gao H, Lin SY, Goss JA, Du C, Li K.	MCPH1, also known as BRIT1, has recently been identified as a novel key regulatory gene of the DNA damage response pathway. MCPH1 is located on human chromosome 8p23.1, where human cancers frequently show loss of heterozygosity. As such, MCPH1 is aberrantly expressed in many malignancies, including breast and ovarian cancers, and the function of MCPH1 has been implicated in tumor suppression. However, it remains poorly understood whether MCPH1 deficiency leads to tumorigenesis. Here we generated and studied both Mcph1(-/-) and Mcph1(-/-)p53(-/-) mice; we showed that Mcph1(-/-) mice developed tumors with long latency, and that primary lymphoma developed significantly earlier in Mcph1(-/-)p53(-/-) mice than in Mcph11(+/+)p53(-/-) and Mcph1(+/-)p53(-/-) mice. The Mcph1(-/-)p53(-/-) lymphomas and derived murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were both more sensitive to irradiation. Mcph1 deficiency resulted in remarkably increased chromosome and chromatid breaks in Mcph1(-/-)p53(-/-) lymphomas and MEFs, as determined by metaphase spread assay and spectral karyotyping analysis. In addition, Mcph1 deficiency significantly enhanced aneuploidy as well as abnormal centrosome multiplication in Mcph1(-/-)p53(-/-) cells. Meanwhile, Mcph1 deficiency impaired double strand break (DSB) repair in Mcph1(-/-)p53(-/-) MEFs as demonstrated by neutral Comet assay. Compared with Mcph1(+/+)p53(-/-) MEFs, homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining activities were significantly decreased in Mcph1(-/-)p53(-/-) MEFs. Notably, reconstituted MCPH1 rescued the defects of DSB repair and alleviated chromosomal aberrations in Mcph1(-/-)p53(-/-) MEFs. Taken together, our data demonstrate MCPH1 deficiency promotes genomic instability and increases cancer susceptibility. Our study using knockout mouse models provides convincing genetic evidence that MCPH1 is a bona fide tumor suppressor gene. Its deficiency leading to defective DNA repair in tumors can be used to develop novel targeted cancer therapies in the future.
24681953	Persistent STAT5 activation in myeloid neoplasms recruits p53 into gene regulation.	Girardot M, Pecquet C, Chachoua I, Van Hees J, Guibert S, Ferrant A, Knoops L, Baxter EJ, Beer PA, Giraudier S, Moriggl R, Vainchenker W, Green AR, Constantinescu SN.	STAT (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription) transcription factors are constitutively activated in most hematopoietic cancers. We previously identified a target gene, LPP/miR-28 (LIM domain containing preferred translocation partner in lipoma), induced by constitutive activation of STAT5, but not by transient cytokine-activated STAT5. miR-28 exerts negative effects on thrombopoietin receptor signaling and platelet formation. Here, we demonstrate that, in transformed hematopoietic cells, STAT5 and p53 must be synergistically bound to chromatin for induction of LPP/miR-28 transcription. Genome-wide association studies show that both STAT5 and p53 are co-localized on the chromatin at 463 genomic positions in proximal promoters. Chromatin binding of p53 is dependent on persistent STAT5 activation at these proximal promoters. The transcriptional activity of selected promoters bound by STAT5 and p53 was significantly changed upon STAT5 or p53 inhibition. Abnormal expression of several STAT5-p53 target genes (LEP, ATP5J, GTF2A2, VEGFC, NPY1R and NPY5R) is frequently detected in platelets of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) patients, but not in platelets from healthy controls. In conclusion, persistently active STAT5 can recruit normal p53, like in the case of MPN cells, but also p53 mutants, such as p53 M133K in human erythroleukemia cells, leading to pathologic gene expression that differs from canonical STAT5 or p53 transcriptional programs.
25804735	p53 Enables metabolic fitness and self-renewal of nephron progenitor cells.	Li Y, Liu J, Li W, Brown A, Baddoo M, Li M, Carroll T, Oxburgh L, Feng Y, Saifudeen Z.	Contrary to its classic role in restraining cell proliferation, we demonstrate here a divergent function of p53 in the maintenance of self-renewal of the nephron progenitor pool in the embryonic mouse kidney. Nephron endowment is regulated by progenitor availability and differentiation potential. Conditional deletion of p53 in nephron progenitor cells (Six2Cre(+);p53(fl/fl)) induces progressive depletion of Cited1(+)/Six2(+) self-renewing progenitors and loss of cap mesenchyme (CM) integrity. The Six2(p53-null) CM is disorganized, with interspersed stromal cells and an absence of a distinct CM-epithelia and CM-stroma interface. Impaired cell adhesion and epithelialization are indicated by decreased E-cadherin and NCAM expression and by ineffective differentiation in response to Wnt induction. The Six2Cre(+);p53(fl/fl) cap has 30% fewer Six2(GFP(+)) cells. Apoptotic index is unchanged, whereas proliferation index is significantly reduced in accordance with cell cycle analysis showing disproportionately fewer Six2Cre(+);p53(fl/fl) cells in the S and G2/M phases compared with Six2Cre(+);p53(+/+) cells. Mutant kidneys are hypoplastic with fewer generations of nascent nephrons. A significant increase in mean arterial pressure is observed in early adulthood in both germline and conditional Six2(p53-null) mice, linking p53-mediated defects in kidney development to hypertension. RNA-Seq analyses of FACS-isolated wild-type and Six2(GFP(+)) CM cells revealed that the top downregulated genes in Six2Cre(+);p53(fl/fl) CM belong to glucose metabolism and adhesion and/or migration pathways. Mutant cells exhibit a ∼ 50% decrease in ATP levels and a 30% decrease in levels of reactive oxygen species, indicating energy metabolism dysfunction. In summary, our data indicate a novel role for p53 in enabling the metabolic fitness and self-renewal of nephron progenitors.
25634217	Prostaglandin E2 inhibits p53 in human breast adipose stromal cells: a novel mechanism for the regulation of aromatase in obesity and breast cancer.	Wang X, Docanto MM, Sasano H, Kathleen Cuningham Foundation Consortium for Research into Familial Breast Cancer, Lo C, Simpson ER, Brown KA.	Obesity is a risk factor for postmenopausal breast cancer and the majority of these cancers are estrogen dependent. Aromatase converts androgens into estrogens and its increased expression in breast adipose stromal cells (ASC) is a major driver of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. In particular, obesity-associated and tumor-derived factors, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), have been shown to drive the expression of aromatase by stimulating the activity of the proximal promoter II (PII). The tumor-suppressor p53 is a key regulator of cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis and is frequently mutated in breast cancer. Mutations in p53 are rare in tumor-associated ASCs. Therefore, it was hypothesized that p53 is regulated by PGE2 and involved in the PGE2-mediated regulation of aromatase. Results demonstrate that PGE2 causes a significant decrease in p53 transcript and nuclear protein expression, as well as phosphorylation at Ser15 in primary human breast ASCs. Stabilization of p53 with RITA leads to a significant decrease in the PGE2-stimulated aromatase mRNA expression and activity, and PII activity. Interaction of p53 with PII was demonstrated and this interaction is decreased in the presence of PGE2. Moreover, mutation of the identified p53 response element leads to an increase in the basal activity of the promoter. Immunofluorescence on clinical samples demonstrates that p53 is decreased in tumor-associated ASCs compared with ASCs from normal breast tissue, and that there is a positive association between perinuclear (inactive) p53 and aromatase expression in these cells. Furthermore, aromatase expression is increased in breast ASCs from Li-Fraumeni patients (germline TP53 mutations) compared with non-Li-Fraumeni breast tissue. Overall, our results demonstrate that p53 is a negative regulator of aromatase in the breast and its inhibition by PGE2 provides a novel mechanism for aromatase regulation in obesity and breast cancer.
25043306	PHF2 histone demethylase acts as a tumor suppressor in association with p53 in cancer.	Lee KH, Park JW, Sung HS, Choi YJ, Kim WH, Lee HS, Chung HJ, Shin HW, Cho CH, Kim TY, Li SH, Youn HD, Kim SJ, Chun YS.	Plant homeodomain finger 2 (PHF2) has a role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression by demethylating H3K9-Me2. Several genome-wide studies have demonstrated that the chromosomal region including the PHF2 gene is often deleted in some cancers including colorectal cancer, and this finding encouraged us to investigate the tumor suppressive role of PHF2. As p53 is a critical tumor suppressor in colon cancer, we tested the possibility that PHF2 is an epigenetic regulator of p53. PHF2 was associated with p53, and thereby, promoted p53-driven gene expression in cancer cells under genotoxic stress. PHF2 converted the chromatin that is favorable for transcription by demethylating the repressive H3K9-Me2 mark. In an HCT116 xenograft model, PHF2 was found to be required for the anticancer effects of oxaliplatin and doxorubicin. In PHF2-deficient xenografts, p53 expression was profoundly induced by both drugs, but its downstream product p21 was not, suggesting that p53 cannot be activated in the absence of PHF2. To find clinical evidence about the role of PHF2, we analyzed the expressions of PHF2, p53 and p21 in human colon cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues from patients. PHF2 was downregulated in cancer tissues and PHF2 correlated with p21 in cancers expressing functional p53. Colon and stomach cancer tissue arrays showed a positive correlation between PHF2 and p21 expressions. Informatics analyses using the Oncomine database also supported our notion that PHF2 is downregulated in colon and stomach cancers. On the basis of these findings, we propose that PHF2 acts as a tumor suppressor in association with p53 in cancer development and ensures p53-mediated cell death in response to chemotherapy.
26475964	Enhanced cytotoxicity of prenylated chalcone against tumour cells via disruption of the p53-MDM2 interaction.	Leão M, Soares J, Gomes S, Raimundo L, Ramos H, Bessa C, Queiroz G, Domingos S, Pinto M, Inga A, Cidade H, Saraiva L.	Chalcones are naturally occurring compounds with recognized anticancer activity. It was recently shown that the O-prenyl derivative (2) of 2'-hydroxy-3,4,4',5,6'-pentamethoxychalcone (1) had a remarkably increased cytotoxicity against human tumour cells compared to its precursor. With this study, we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the improved tumour cytotoxicity of prenylchalcone 2.The impact of chalcones 1 and 2 on p53-MDM2 interaction was investigated using yeast growth-inhibitory and p53 transactivation assays. Their tumour growth-inhibitory effects were assessed on human colon adenocarcinoma HCT116 cell lines with wild-type p53 and its p53-null derivative, followed by analysis of cell cycle and apoptosis. In tumour cells, the activation of a mitochondrial pathway was checked by analysis of reactive oxygen species generation, Bax mitochondrial translocation and cytochrome c release. Additionally, the up-regulation of p53 transcriptional activity was investigated through Western blot analysis of p53 target expression levels, and the disruption of the p53-MDM2 interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation.The potent cell tumour growth-inhibitory activity of prenylchalcone 2 was associated with the activation of a p53 pathway involving cell cycle arrest and a mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. Furthermore, a correlation between the distinct cytotoxicity of chalcones 1 and 2 and their ability to disrupt the p53-MDM2 interaction was established.This work shows that prenylation is a determinant factor for the enhancement of chalcones tumour cytotoxicity by improving their ability to disrupt the p53-MDM2 interaction. Prenylchalcone 2 represents a starting basis for the design of new p53-MDM2 interaction inhibitors with improved antitumor properties.
26187504	APR-246 potently inhibits tumour growth and overcomes chemoresistance in preclinical models of oesophageal adenocarcinoma.	Liu DS, Read M, Cullinane C, Azar WJ, Fennell CM, Montgomery KG, Haupt S, Haupt Y, Wiman KG, Duong CP, Clemons NJ, Phillips WA.	p53 is a critical tumour suppressor and is mutated in 70% of oesophageal adenocarcinomas (OACs), resulting in chemoresistance and poor survival. APR-246 is a first-in-class reactivator of mutant p53 and is currently in clinical trials. In this study, we characterised the activity of APR-246 and its effect on p53 signalling in a large panel of cell line xenograft (CLX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of OAC.In vitro response to APR-246 was assessed using clonogenic survival, cell cycle and apoptosis assays. Ectopic expression, gene knockdown and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout studies of mutant p53 were performed to investigate p53-dependent drug effects. p53 signalling was examined using quantitative RT-PCR and western blot. Synergistic interactions between APR-246 and conventional chemotherapies were evaluated in vitro and in vivo using CLX and PDX models.APR-246 upregulated p53 target genes, inhibited clonogenic survival and induced cell cycle arrest as well as apoptosis in OAC cells harbouring p53 mutations. Sensitivity to APR-246 correlated with cellular levels of mutant p53 protein. Ectopic expression of mutant p53 sensitised p53-null cells to APR-246, while p53 gene knockdown and knockout diminished drug activity. Importantly, APR-246 synergistically enhanced the inhibitory effects of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil through p53 accumulation. Finally, APR-246 demonstrated potent antitumour activity in CLX and PDX models, and restored chemosensitivity to a cisplatin/5-fluorouracil-resistant xenograft model.APR-246 has significant antitumour activity in OAC. Given that APR-246 is safe at therapeutic levels our study strongly suggests that APR-246 can be translated into improving the clinical outcomes for OAC patients.
26183718	p53-Regulated Networks of Protein, mRNA, miRNA, and lncRNA Expression Revealed by Integrated Pulsed Stable Isotope Labeling With Amino Acids in Cell Culture (pSILAC) and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) Analyses.	Hünten S, Kaller M, Drepper F, Oeljeklaus S, Bonfert T, Erhard F, Dueck A, Eichner N, Friedel CC, Meister G, Zimmer R, Warscheid B, Hermeking H.	We determined the effect of p53 activation on de novo protein synthesis using quantitative proteomics (pulsed stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture/pSILAC) in the colorectal cancer cell line SW480. This was combined with mRNA and noncoding RNA expression analyses by next generation sequencing (RNA-, miR-Seq). Furthermore, genome-wide DNA binding of p53 was analyzed by chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP-Seq). Thereby, we identified differentially regulated proteins (542 up, 569 down), mRNAs (1258 up, 415 down), miRNAs (111 up, 95 down) and lncRNAs (270 up, 123 down). Changes in protein and mRNA expression levels showed a positive correlation (r = 0.50, p < 0.0001). In total, we detected 133 direct p53 target genes that were differentially expressed and displayed p53 occupancy in the vicinity of their promoter. More transcriptionally induced genes displayed occupied p53 binding sites (4.3% mRNAs, 7.2% miRNAs, 6.3% lncRNAs, 5.9% proteins) than repressed genes (2.4% mRNAs, 3.2% miRNAs, 0.8% lncRNAs, 1.9% proteins), suggesting indirect mechanisms of repression. Around 50% of the down-regulated proteins displayed seed-matching sequences of p53-induced miRNAs in the corresponding 3'-UTRs. Moreover, proteins repressed by p53 significantly overlapped with those previously shown to be repressed by miR-34a. We confirmed up-regulation of the novel direct p53 target genes LINC01021, MDFI, ST14 and miR-486 and showed that ectopic LINC01021 expression inhibits proliferation in SW480 cells. Furthermore, KLF12, HMGB1 and CIT mRNAs were confirmed as direct targets of the p53-induced miR-34a, miR-205 and miR-486-5p, respectively. In line with the loss of p53 function during tumor progression, elevated expression of KLF12, HMGB1 and CIT was detected in advanced stages of cancer. In conclusion, the integration of multiple omics methods allowed the comprehensive identification of direct and indirect effectors of p53 that provide new insights and leads into the mechanisms of p53-mediated tumor suppression.
26111627	Insulin Receptor Substrate-1 Activation Mediated p53 Downregulation Protects Against Hypoxic-Ischemia in the Neonatal Brain.	Tu YF, Jiang ST, Chow YH, Huang CC, Ho CJ, Chou YP.	This study determined if dietary restriction (DR) protects against hypoxic-ischemia (HI) in the neonatal brain via insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)/Akt pathway-mediated downregulation of p53 in the neurovascular unit. On postnatal (P) day 7, HI was induced in rat pups grouped from P1 into normal litter size (NL, 12 pups/dam) and increased litter size (DR, 18 pups/dam). In vivo IRS-1 anti-sense oligonucleotide and IRS-1 overexpressed recombinant adenovirus were given, and neurovascular damage was assessed. In vitro models of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) examined the inhibition and overexpression of IRS-1 on p53 and cell death in neurons and endothelial cells. Compared to NL pups, DR pups had significantly higher IRS-1, p-IRS-1, and pAkt levels, decreased p53, more tight junction proteins, reduced blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage after HI, and less infarct volumes at P21. Immunofluorescence revealed that IRS-1 was upregulated in the endothelial cells and neurons of DR pups. IRS-1 downregulation in DR pups reduced p-Akt, increased p53, worsened BBB damage, and increased brain injury, whereas IRS-1 overexpression in NL pups upregulated p-Akt, decreased p53, attenuated BBB damage, and decreased brain injury. In vitro, IRS-1 downregulation aggravated cell death in neurons and endothelial cells and is associated with decreased p-Akt and increased p53. In contrast, IRS-1 overexpression reduced cell death in endothelial cells with increased p-Akt and decreased p53. In conclusion, DR reduces neurovascular damage after HI in the neonatal brain through an IRS-1/Akt-mediated p53 downregulation, suggesting that IRS-1 signaling is a therapeutic target for hypoxic brain injury in neonates.
24798859	Regulation of p53-targeting microRNAs by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons: Implications in the etiology of multiple myeloma.	Gordon MW, Yan F, Zhong X, Mazumder PB, Xu-Monette ZY, Zou D, Young KH, Ramos KS, Li Y.	Multiple myeloma (MM) is a common and deadly cancer of blood plasma cells. A unique feature of MM is the extremely low somatic mutation rate of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, in sharp contrast with about half of all human cancers where this gene is frequently mutated. Eleven miRNAs have been reported to repress p53 through direct interaction with the 3' untranslated region. The expression of nine of them is higher in MM plasma cells than in healthy donor counterparts, suggesting that miRNA overexpression is responsible for p53 inactivation in MM. Here, we report that the environmental carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) upregulated the expression of seven p53-targeting miRNAs (miR-25, miR-15a, miR-16, miR-92, miR-125b, miR-141, and miR-200a), while 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-ρ-dioxin (TCDD) upregulated two of them (miR-25 and miR-92) in MM cells. The miR-25 promoter was activated by both BaP and TCDD, and this response was mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). We screened 727 compounds that inhibit MM cell survival and down-regulate the expression of p53-targeting miRNAs. We found that (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a constituent of green tea and a major component of the botanical drug Polyphenon® E, reduced the expression of four p53-targeting miRNAs, including miR-25, miR-92, miR-141, and miR-200a. Collectively, these data implicate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and AhR in the regulation of p53-targeting miRNAs in MM and identify a potential therapeutic and preventive agent to combat this deadly disease. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
24862407	Loss of Sparc in p53-null Astrocytes Promotes Macrophage Activation and Phagocytosis Resulting in Decreased Tumor Size and Tumor Cell Survival.	Thomas SL, Schultz CR, Mouzon E, Golembieski WA, El Naili R, Radakrishnan A, Lemke N, Poisson LM, Gutiérrez JA, Cottingham S, Rempel SA.	Both the induction of SPARC expression and the loss of the p53 tumor suppressor gene are changes that occur early in glioma development. Both SPARC and p53 regulate glioma cell survival by inverse effects on apoptotic signaling. Therefore, during glioma formation, the upregulation of SPARC may cooperate with the loss of p53 to enhance cell survival. This study determined whether the loss of Sparc in astrocytes that are null for p53 would result in reduced cell survival and tumor formation and increased tumor immunogenicity in an in vivo xenograft brain tumor model. In vitro, the loss of Sparc in p53-null astrocytes resulted in an increase in cell proliferation, but a loss of tumorigenicity. At 7 days after intracranial implantation, Sparc-null tumors had decreased tumor cell survival, proliferation and reduced tumor size. The loss of Sparc promoted microglia/macrophage activation and phagocytosis of tumor cells. Our results indicate that the loss of p53 by deletion/mutation in the early stages of glioma formation may cooperate with the induction of SPARC to potentiate cancer cell survival and escape from immune surveillance.
26044651	Growth inhibitory effect of adenovirus-mediated tissue-targeted expression of ribosomal protein L23 on human colorectal carcinoma cells.	Fang H, Kang J, Du R, Zhao X, Zhang X, Ren D, Zhang Y, Lu Z, Wu S, Zheng W, Wen J.	A large body of evidence has established murine double minute 2 (MDM2) as a crucial negative regulator of p53 and the major suppressor of p53 function in tumors with wild-type (wt)-p53. Therefore, by inhibiting MDM2 one may reactivate p53 in tumor cells, leading to their demise. Previous studies revealed that ribosomal protein L23 (RPL23) inhibited MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination through direct binding to MDM2, and subsequently induced the p53 level as well as its activity, suggesting that it may be a candidate for use in tumor gene therapy. In the present study, we developed a recombinant adenoviral vector expressing the RPL23 gene under control of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) promoter (rAd/CEA-RPL23), and using an in vitro system with cultured human colorectal carcinoma LoVo cells harboring the wt-p53 gene, we proved that rAd/CEA-RPL23 infection could induce the accumulation of endogenous wt-p53 protein and thus lead to the inhibition of tumor cell growth via inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In vivo treatment of rAd/CEA-RPL23 also exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on tumor growth in nude mice bearing LoVo xenografts. Furthermore, we showed that rAd/CEA-RPL23 synergized with classic chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and enhanced its activity against LoVo cells in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, the data presented here suggest that CEA promoter-targeted exogenous RPL23 expression could be of therapeutic value against human colorectal carcinoma that retains wt-p53.

25351378	Biological characteristics of Taxol‑resistant ovarian cancer cells and reversal of Taxol resistance by adenovirus expressing p53.	Liu Q, Sui R, Li R, Miao J, Liu J.	The development of acquired drug resistance is the primary cause of chemotherapy failure in the treatment of ovarian cancer. To examine the mechanism underlying Taxol (TAX) resistance in ovarian cancer and attempt to reverse it, the present study induced a TAX‑resistant ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3/TAX using a gradient concentration increment method. The properties of the resistant cell line were initially investigated by proliferation, colony formation, adhesion and cell cycle analysis compared with control SKOV3 cells. To examine the mechanism, the expression of p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) was compared between SKOV3/TAX and SKOV3 cells by western blot analysis. An adenovirus expressing p53 (Ad‑p53), alone or in combination with TAX, was used to treat the drug‑resistant ovarian cancer cells SKOV3/TAX. The effects of Ad‑p53 on pro‑apoptosis and the reversal of drug resistance were evaluated using flow cytometric analysis, cleaved‑poly ADP‑ribose polymerase detection, microscopic observation and MTT measurement. Compared with the control cells, the TAX‑resistant ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3/TAX was characterized by reduced sensitivity to TAX treatment, a significantly slower proliferation rate, higher colony‑forming efficiency and higher adhesion ability. However, no significant difference in cell cycle distribution was identified. PUMA, a potent pro‑apoptotic protein, was markedly suppressed in the SKOV3/TAX cells. Ad‑p53 infection stimulated the upregulation of PUMA and re‑sensitized the resistant ovarian cancer cells to TAX by an apoptotic mechanism. Therefore, Ad‑p53 infection is an effective gene therapy method to re‑sensitize the resistant ovarian cancer cells to TAX by restoring the expression of PUMA.
25617504	Disruption of a regulatory loop between DUSP1 and p53 contributes to hepatocellular carcinoma development and progression.	Hao PP, Li H, Lee MJ, Wang YP, Kim JH, Yu GR, Lee SY, Leem SH, Jang KY, Kim DG.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Altered expression of dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) is common in tumors including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and is predictive of tumor progression and poor prognosis. However, the tumor suppressive role of DUSP1 has yet to be clearly elucidated. METHODS: The molecular mechanisms of tumor suppression that were investigated were induction of apoptosis, cell cycle inhibition, and regulation of p53. Additionally, the antitumor effect of DUSP1 was assessed using a mouse model. Associated signaling pathways in HCC cells and tissues were examined. RESULTS: Downregulation of DUSP1 expression was significantly correlated with poor differentiation (p<0.001) and advanced HCC stage (p=0.023). DUSP1 expression resulted in HCC suppression and longer survival (p=0.0002) in a xenoplant mice model. DUSP1 inhibited p38 MAPK phosphorylation and subsequently suppressed HSP27 activation, resulting in enhanced p53 phosphorylation at sites S15, S20, and S46 in HCC cells. Enhanced p53 activation induced the expression of target genes p21 and p27, which are linked to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Thus, DUSP1 was potentially linked to p53 activation via the p38 MAPK/HSP27 pathway. Wild-type but not mutant p53 transcriptionally upregulated DUSP1 via its DNA-binding domain. DUSP1 and p53 might collaborate to suppress tumors in hepatocarcinogenesis via a positive regulatory loop. CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed that disruption of a positive regulatory loop between DUSP1 and p53 promoted HCC development and progression, providing a rationale for a therapeutic agent that restores DUSP1 in HCC.
24898479	Expression of p53, Ki67, EcPV2- and EcPV3 DNA, and viral genes in relation to metastasis and outcome in equine penile and preputial squamous cell carcinoma.	van den Top JG, Harkema L, Lange C, Ensink JM, van de Lest CH, Barneveld A, van Weeren PR, Gröne A, Martens A.	REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Equine penile and preputial squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a potentially lethal disease of which little is known regarding the relationship between tumour characteristics and prognosis. OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between tumour differentiation grade (tumour subtype), presence of papillomaviruses, expression of viral genes (E2, E6, L1), nuclear proteins p53 and Ki67 and metastasis in equine penile and preputial SCC and to assess the relationship of tumour subtype, presence of papillomavirus type 2, p53 and Ki67 with survival. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study using archived material. METHODS: Samples (n = 103) from 87 horses with penile and/or preputial intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), papilloma or SCC and corresponding case files were evaluated. Tumours were graded microscopically and p53 and Ki67 expression evaluated immunohistochemically. Equine papillomavirus (EcPV) types 2 and 3 DNA was detected by conventional PCR. Real-time PCR was used for quantification of E2, E6 and L1 mRNA. RESULTS: Equine papillomavirus type 2 DNA was detected in 89.4% and EcPV3 in 1.5% of horses. No differences in quantitative expression of E2, E6 and L1 oncogenes between subtypes were found. Expression of p53 and occurrence of metastasis were positively correlated to a less differentiated subtype (r = 0.429, P<0.001 and r = 0.769, P = 0.001, respectively). Differences in survival between subtypes were significant (log Rank P<0.001); horses with less differentiated tumours were more likely to die of the disease (papilloma 8.3%; G1 26.1%; G2 26.3%; G3 63.3%). CONCLUSIONS: In equine penile and preputial SCC, tumour grading is an important prognosticator for survival and a predictor for presence of metastases. Expression of p53 and Ki67 and presence or expression of EcPV2 and EcPV3 do not appear to be important prognosticators.
26250624	The tumor suppressor p53 guides GluA1 homeostasis through Nedd4-2 during chronic elevation of neuronal activity.	Jewett KA, Zhu J, Tsai NP.	Chronic activity perturbation in neurons can trigger homeostatic mechanisms to restore the baseline function. Although the importance and dysregulation of neuronal activity homeostasis has been implicated in neurological disorders such as epilepsy, the complete signaling by which chronic changes in neuronal activity initiate the homeostatic mechanisms is unclear. We report here that the tumor suppressor p53 and its signaling are involved in neuronal activity homeostasis. Upon chronic elevation of neuronal activity in primary cortical neuron cultures, the ubiquitin E3 ligase, murine double minute- 2 (Mdm2), is phosphorylated by the kinase Akt. Phosphorylated Mdm2 triggers the degradation of p53 and subsequent induction of a p53 target gene, neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated gene 4-like (Nedd4-2). Nedd4-2 encodes another ubiquitin E3 ligase. We identified glutamate receptor subunit 1 (GluA1), subunit of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors as a novel substrate of Nedd4-2. The regulation of GluA1 level is known to be crucial for neuronal activity homeostasis. We confirmed that, by pharmacologically inhibiting Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation or genetically reducing Nedd4-2 in a mouse model, the GluA1 ubiquitination and down-regulation induced by chronically elevated neuronal activity are both attenuated. Our findings demonstrate the first direct function of p53 in neuronal homeostasis and elucidate a new mechanism by which cortical neurons respond to chronic activity perturbation. Chronic neuronal activity perturbation triggers homeostatic mechanisms at the synapses. We reported that the tumor suppressor p53 and its modulator Mdm2 guide the ubiquitination and down-regulation of the GluA1 subunit of AMPA receptor during activity stimulation. Nedd4-2, a direct target of p53, is identified as a new ubiquitin E3 ligase for GluA1, providing a novel mechanism to fine-tune post-synaptic homeostasis.
26320182	Characterization of the metastatic phenotype of a panel of established osteosarcoma cells.	Ren L, Mendoza A, Zhu J, Briggs JW, Halsey C, Hong ES, Burkett SS, Morrow J, Lizardo MM, Osborne T, Li SQ, Luu HH, Meltzer P, Khanna C.	Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) has been shown to promote breast cancer growth via different mechanisms. In addition to binding to ERα, the DHT membrane receptor exists on integrin αvβ3. Resveratrol induces p53-dependent apoptosis via plasma membrane integrin αvβ3. Resveratrol and DHT signals are both transduced by activated ERK1/2; however, DHT promotes cell proliferation in cancer cells, whereas resveratrol is pro-apoptotic. In this study, we examined the mechanism by which DHT inhibits resveratrol-induced apoptosis in human ERα positive (MCF-7) and negative (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells. DHT inhibited resveratrol-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser-15 of p53 in a concentration-dependent manner. These effects of DHT on resveratrol action were blocked by an ERα antagonist, ICI 182,780, in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. DHT inhibited resveratrol-induced nuclear complex of p53-COX-2 formation which is required p53-dependent apoptosis. ChIP studies of COX-2/p53 binding to DNA and expression of p53-responsive genes indicated that DHT inhibited resveratrol-induced p53-directed transcriptional activity. In addition, DHT did inhibit resveratrol-induced COX-2/p53-dependent gene expression. These results suggest that DHT inhibits p53-dependent apoptosis in breast cancer cells by interfering with nuclear COX-2 accumulation which is essential for stimulation of apoptotic pathways. Thus, the surface receptor sites for resveratrol and DHT are discrete and activate ERK1/2-dependent downstream effects on apoptosis that are distinctive. These studies provide new insights into the antagonizing effects of resveratrol versus DHT, an important step toward better understanding and eventually treating breast cancer. It also indicates the complex pathways by which apoptosis is induced by resveratrol in DHT-depleted and -repleted environments.
26476535	Interaction between p53 codon 72 and MDM2 309T>G polymorphisms and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.	Qiu M, Liu Y, Yu X, Qin L, Bei C, Zeng X, Qiu X, Tang B, He S, Yu H.	The p53 tumor suppressor and its negative regulator, murine double minute 2 (MDM2), play critical roles in carcinogenesis. P53 codon 72 and MDM2 309T>G polymorphisms could influence p53 and MDM2 function, respectively, and might affect cancer susceptibility. We therefore investigated the association between these two SNPs, alone or in combination, and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Chinese. In this case-control study, we genotyped p53 codon 72 and MDM2 309T>G polymorphisms in 985 HCC cases and 992 cancer-free age- and sex-matched controls and evaluated their associations with the risk of HCC. Although no significant main effects were found for these two SNPs in the single-locus analysis and stratified analysis by age, sex, smoking, drinking, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, we found that individuals carrying at least one G allele of the MDM2 309T>G polymorphism had statistically significant increased risk of HCC among those with the p53 Pro/Pro genotype (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.23, 95 % confidence interval (95%CI) = 1.20-4.14 for TG genotype; adjusted OR = 2.67, 95%CI = 1.32-5.42 for GG genotype), and the interaction between p53 codon 72 and MDM2 309T>G was significant (P interaction = 0.017). Our findings suggest that the interaction of p53 codon 72 and MDM2 309T>G may play an important role in the etiology of HCC. More studies with well-designed and large sample sizes are required to validate these observations.
26431163	Mdm2 inhibition confers protection of p53-proficient cells from the cytotoxic effects of Wee1 inhibitors.	Li Y, Saini P, Sriraman A, Dobbelstein M.	Pharmacological inhibition of the cell cycle regulatory kinase Wee1 represents a promising strategy to eliminate cancer cells. Wee1 inhibitors cooperate with chemotherapeutics, e. g. nucleoside analogues, pushing malignant cells from S phase towards premature mitosis and death. However, considerable toxicities are observed in preclinical and clinical trials. A high proportion of tumor cells can be distinguished from all other cells of a patient's body by inactivating mutations in the tumor suppressor p53. Here we set out to develop an approach for the selective protection of p53-proficient cells against the cytotoxic effects of Wee1 inhibitors. We pretreated such cells with Nutlin-3a, a prototype inhibitor of the p53-antagonist Mdm2. The resulting transient cell cycle arrest effectively increased the survival of cells that were subsequently treated with combinations of the Wee1 inhibitor MK-1775 and/or the nucleoside analogue gemcitabine. In this constellation, Nutlin-3a reduced caspase activation and diminished the phosphorylation of Histone 2AX, an indicator of the DNA damage response. Both effects were strictly dependent on the presence of p53. Moreover, Nutlin pre-treatment reduced the fraction of cells that were undergoing premature mitosis in response to Wee1 inhibition. We conclude that the pre-activation of p53 through Mdm2 antagonists serves as a viable option to selectively protect p53-proficient cells against the cytotoxic effects of Wee1 inhibitors, especially when combined with a nucleoside analogue. Thus, Mdm2 antagonists might prove useful to avoid unwanted side effects of Wee1 inhibitors. On the other hand, when a tumor contains wild type p53, care should be taken not to induce its activity before applying Wee1 inhibitors.
26232255	A new genotoxicity assay based on p53 target gene induction.	Zerdoumi Y, Kasper E, Soubigou F, Adriouch S, Bougeard G, Frebourg T, Flaman JM.	The p53 tumor suppressor protein has emerged as a universal sensor of genotoxic stress that regulates the transcription of numerous genes required for appropriate cellular response to DNA damage. Therefore, transcriptional induction of p53 target genes can be considered as a global and early indicator of genotoxic stress. By performing expression microarrays and RNA-Seq analysis on wild-type and mutant TP53 human lymphocytes respectively derived from controls and Li-Fraumeni patients and exposed to different classes of genotoxic agents, we first determined a common p53-dependent transcriptional signature of DNA damage. We then derived a simple and fast assay based on the exposure of wild-type TP53 lymphocytes to physical or chemical agents and on the quantitative measurement of selected p53 target gene transcriptional induction. The specificity of the p53 genotoxicity assay can easily be demonstrated by performing the same experiment in control lymphocytes with heterozygous TP53 mutations, which compromise responses to DNA damage. This assay allowed us to show that most of the drugs commonly used in cancer treatment, except the microtubule poisons, are highly genotoxic. The p53 genotoxicity assay should facilitate the measurement of the genotoxic effects of chemical and physical agents and the identification of drugs that are not genotoxic and do not expose patients to the risk of secondary malignancies, especially those with a constitutional defect in response to DNA damage, such as patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome.
26521214	Reciprocal regulation of p53 and NF-κB by diacylglycerol kinase ζ.	Tanaka T, Tsuchiya R, Hozumi Y, Nakano T, Okada M, Goto K.	Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) participates in lipid mediated-signal transduction. It phosphorylates diacylglycerol (DG) to phosphatidic acid (PA), thereby regulating the balanced control of these second messenger actions. Previous reports have described that one DGK family, DGKζ, is closely involved in stress responses under various conditions. Cellular stress response, a physiological process enabling cells to cope with an altered environment, is finely tuned through various signaling cascades and their molecular crosstalk. The major components of stress response are p53 and NF-κB. p53 generally serves as a proapoptotic transcriptional factor, whereas NF-κB promotes resistance to programmed cell death under most circumstances. Recent studies have suggested that DGKζ facilitates p53 degradation in cytoplasm through ubiquitin proteasome system and that DGKζ deletion upregulates p53 protein levels under basal and DNA-damage conditions. Counter-intuitively, however, DGKζ deletion suppresses p53 transcriptional activity despite increased p53 levels. In contrast, DGKζ knockdown engenders enhancement of NF-κB pathway in response to cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β. In response to these cytokines, DGKζ downregulation accelerates phosphorylation of the p65 subunit and its nuclear translocation, thereby enhancing NF-κB transcriptional activity. Furthermore, DGKζ deficiency is shown to promote increased association of p65 subunit with the transcriptional cofactor CBP. It is particularly interesting that this association is observed even under basal conditions in the absence of stimulation. These findings suggest that DGKζ plays a role in sequestration of the limiting pool of CBP/p300 between the NF-κB p65 subunit and p53, and that DGKζ downregulation shifts CBP/p300 toward the NF-κB subunit to regulate reciprocally antagonistic phenotypes of these transcription factors.
25412846	High p53 protein expression in therapy-related myeloid neoplasms is associated with adverse karyotype and poor outcome.	Cleven AH, Nardi V, Ok CY, Goswami M, Dal Cin P, Zheng Z, Iafrate AJ, Abdul Hamid MA, Wang SA, Hasserjian RP.	Identification of p53-positive cells by immunohistochemistry in bone marrow from primary myelodysplastic syndrome patients correlates with the presence of TP53 mutations and poor prognosis. Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 are more frequent in therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome than in de novo disease, but the role of p53 immunohistochemistry in the therapy-related setting has not been specifically investigated. We studied p53 protein immunoreactivity in bone marrow biopsies of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms and correlated protein expression with TP53 mutation status, clinicopathologic features and outcome. We first studied 32 patients with therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and 63 patients with therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome/chronic myelomonocytic leukemia from one institution and then validated our results in a separate group of 32 patients with therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and 56 patients with therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome from a different institution. Strong p53 immunostaining in ≥1% of bone marrow cells was highly predictive of a TP53 gene mutation (P<0.0001) and was strongly associated with a high-risk karyotype (P<0.0001). The presence of ≥1% p53 strongly positive cells was associated with poorer overall and disease-specific survival, particularly in the subset of patients treated with stem-cell transplantation. In a multivariable Cox regression model, the presence of ≥1% p53 strongly expressing cells was an independent prognostic marker for overall survival in both cohorts, with hazard ratios of 3.434 (CI: 1.751-6.735, P<0.0001) and 3.156 (CI: 1.502-6.628, P=0.002). Our data indicate that p53 protein expression, evaluated in bone marrow biopsies by a widely available immunohistochemical method, prognostically stratifies patients with therapy-related myeloid neoplasms independent of other risk factors. p53 immunostaining thus represents an easily applicable method to assess risk in therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome patients.
25713207	Induction of human UDP-Glucuronosyltransferase 2B7 gene expression by cytotoxic anticancer drugs in liver cancer HepG2 cells.	Hu DG, Mackenzie PI, Lu L, Meech R, McKinnon RA.	We recently reported induction of UGT2B7 by its substrate epirubicin, a cytotoxic anthracycline anticancer drug, via activation of p53 and subsequent recruitment of p53 to the UGT2B7 promoter in hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. Using the same HepG2 model cell line, the present study assessed the possibility of a similar induction of UGT2B7 by several other cytotoxic drugs. We first demonstrated by reverse transcriptase quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction that, as observed with epirubicin, nine cytotoxic drugs including three anthracyclines (doxorubicin, daunorubicin, and idarubicin) and six nonanthracyclines (mitomycin C, 5-fluorouracil, camptothecin, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin, topotecan, and etoposide) significantly increased UGT2B7 mRNA levels. To investigate a potential involvement of p53 in this induction, we conducted further experiments with four of the nine drugs (doxorubicin, daunorubicin, idarubicin, and mitomycin C). The cytotoxic drugs studied increased p53 and UGT2B7 protein levels. Knockdown of p53 expression by small interfering RNA reduced cytotoxic drug-induced UGT2B7 expression. Luciferase reporter assays showed activation of the UGT2B7 promoter by cytotoxic drugs via a previously reported p53 site. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated p53 recruitment to the UGT2B7 p53 site upon exposure to mitomycin C, the most potent UGT2B7 inducer among the nine tested drugs. Taken together, these results provide further evidence supporting UGT2B7 as a p53 target gene. The cytotoxic drug-induced UGT2B7 activity in target liver cancer cells or possibly in normal liver cells may affect the therapeutic efficacy of co-administered cytotoxic drugs (e.g., epirubicin) and noncytotoxic drugs (e.g., morphine), which are UGT2B7 substrates.
26216949	The isolation of an RNA aptamer targeting to p53 protein with single amino acid mutation.	Chen L, Rashid F, Shah A, Awan HM, Wu M, Liu A, Wang J, Zhu T, Luo Z, Shan G.	p53, known as a tumor suppressor, is a DNA binding protein that regulates cell cycle, activates DNA repair proteins, and triggers apoptosis in multicellular animals. More than 50% of human cancers contain a mutation or deletion of the p53 gene, and p53R175 is one of the hot spots of p53 mutation. Nucleic acid aptamers are short single-stranded oligonucleotides that are able to bind various targets, and they are typically isolated from an experimental procedure called systematic evolution of ligand exponential enrichment (SELEX). Using a previously unidentified strategy of contrast screening with SELEX, we have isolated an RNA aptamer targeting p53R175H. This RNA aptamer (p53R175H-APT) has a significantly stronger affinity to p53R175H than to the wild-type p53 in both in vitro and in vivo assays. p53R175H-APT decreased the growth rate, weakened the migration capability, and triggered apoptosis in human lung cancer cells harboring p53R175H. Further analysis actually indicated that p53R175H-APT might partially rescue or correct the p53R175H to function more like the wild-type p53. In situ injections of p53R175H-APT to the tumor xenografts confirmed the effects of this RNA aptamer on p53R175H mutation in mice.
26103464	Np9, a cellular protein of retroviral ancestry restricted to human, chimpanzee and gorilla, binds and regulates ubiquitin ligase MDM2.	Heyne K, Kölsch K, Bruand M, Kremmer E, Grässer FA, Mayer J, Roemer K.	Humans and primates are long-lived animals with long reproductive phases. One factor that appears to contribute to longevity and fertility in humans, as well as to cancer-free survival, is the transcription factor and tumor suppressor p53, controlled by its main negative regulator MDM2. However, p53 and MDM2 homologs are found throughout the metazoan kingdom from Trichoplacidae to Hominidae. Therefore the question arises, if p53/MDM2 contributes to the shaping of primate features, then through which mechanisms. Previous findings have indicated that the appearances of novel p53-regulated genes and wild-type p53 variants during primate evolution are important in this context. Here, we report on another mechanism of potential relevance. Human endogenous retrovirus K subgroup HML-2 (HERV-K(HML-2)) type 1 proviral sequences were formed in the genomes of the predecessors of contemporary Hominoidea and can be identified in the genomes of Nomascus leucogenys (gibbon) up to Homo sapiens. We previously reported on an alternative splicing event in HERV-K(HML-2) type 1 proviruses that can give rise to nuclear protein of 9 kDa (Np9). We document here the evolution of Np9-coding capacity in human, chimpanzee and gorilla, and show that the C-terminal half of Np9 binds directly to MDM2, through a domain of MDM2 that is known to be contacted by various cellular proteins in response to stress. Np9 can inhibit the MDM2 ubiquitin ligase activity toward p53 in the cell nucleus, and can support the transactivation of genes by p53. Our findings point to the possibility that endogenous retrovirus protein Np9 contributes to the regulation of the p53-MDM2 pathway specifically in humans, chimpanzees and gorillas.
25939381	Tip110 Regulates the Cross Talk between p53 and Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1α under Hypoxia and Promotes Survival of Cancer Cells.	Timani KA, Liu Y, Fan Y, Mohammad KS, He JJ.	Hypoxia often occurs under various physiological and pathophysiological conditions, including solid tumors; it is linked to malignant transformation, metastatic progression, and treatment failure or resistance. Tip110 protein plays important roles in several known physiological and pathophysiological processes, including cancers. Thus, in the present study we investigated the regulation of Tip110 expression under hypoxia. Hypoxia led to Tip110 protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Under hypoxia, Tip110 stabilized p53, which in return destabilized Tip110. In addition, Tip110 regulated hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), likely through enhancement of its protein stability. Furthermore, Tip110 upregulated p300, a known coactivator for both p53 and HIF-1α. Expression of a p53(22/23) mutant deficient in p300 binding accelerated Tip110 degradation under hypoxia. Tip110 knockdown resulted in the inhibition of cell proliferation and cell death in the presence of p53. Finally, significantly less Tip110, p53, and HIF-1α was detected in the hypoxic region of bone metastasis tumors in a mouse model of human melanoma cells. Taken together, these results suggest Tip110 is an important mediator in the cross talk between p53 and HIF-1α in response to hypoxic stress.
25637791	Heat shock protein gp96 decreases p53 stability by regulating Mdm2 E3 ligase activity in liver cancer.	Wu B, Chu X, Feng C, Hou J, Fan H, Liu N, Li C, Kong X, Ye X, Meng S.	The resistance to apoptosis displayed by liver cancer plays a key role in hepatocarcinogenesis, tumor progression, and resistance to chemo- or radio-therapy. In this study, we uncovered the potential role and mechanism of heat shock protein gp96 in regulating liver tumor cell growth and apoptosis. P53 protein was identified as a gp96 client protein by profiling apoptosis-related proteins in gp96-knockdown liver cancer cells. Overexpression and knockdown studies both demonstrated that gp96 decreases p53 protein levels, and gp96 regulated cell apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. We further provide evidence that gp96 interacts with both p53 and Mdm2 to enhance Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation. Moreover, targeting gp96 with siRNA induced cell apoptosis and led to the suppression of liver tumor growth in vivo. In conclusion, we elucidated an underlying mechanism by which gp96 promotes p53 degradation via increasing Mdm2 E3 ligase activity and provided a new therapeutic strategy to target the gp96-mediated anti-apoptotic characteristic of hepatocellular carcinoma.
25355039	Prognostic value of COX-2, P53, and EZH-2 evaluated by quantitative image analysis in premalignant and malignant breast lesions.	Nicolopoulou-Stamati P, Tsipis A, Chelidonis G, Patsouris E, Athanassiadou P, Gonidi M, Athanassiadou AM.	BACKGROUND: Cytological differential diagnosis of atypical hyperplasia and well differentiated breast carcinoma may be challenging, because sometimes there is an overlap between the cytomorphological features of these lesions. The aim of the study was to investigate COX-2, EZH-2, p53 expression in carcinomas and the gray zone of breast cytology categories of atypical hyperplastic lesions with regard to biological behavior of the tumor. METHODS: FNA speciments from 100 patients with breast hyperplastic lesions and cancer were investigated by immunocytochemistry and a quantitative analysis for COX-2, p53, and EZH-2. RESULTS: Extent of staining for COX-2 correlated with percentage of positive for EZH-2 (P < 0.0001) and p53 nuclei (P < 0.001). The intensity of COX-2 was lower in the carcinoma group (118.57 ± 12.43) than in the hyperplastic (127.16 ± 11.71) group (P = 0.006). On the contrary the mean value of staining extent was greater in the adenocarcinoma cases (15.96 ± 13.03) than in hyperplastic (4.04 ± 1.94) cases (P < 0.0001). The percentage of EZH-2 and p53 positive cells correlated with the histological type of the lesions (P = 0.001 and P = 0.011, respectively). There was also a statistically significant relation between tumor size and expression of COX-2 (P = 0.007) and EZH-2 (P = 0.010). CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the expression of COX-2, EZH-2, and p53 as determined by immunocytochemistry at quantitative level may be a predictor for distinguishing cytologically atypical hyperplastic from malignant breast lesions and may be regarded as potential prognostic factor in breast cancer patients.
25864751	The expression of p53, mgmt and egfr in brain glioma and clinical significance.	Lin T, Wang M, Liang HS, Liu EZ.	In order to discuss the expression of P53, MGMT (O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) and EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) in brain glioma and their clinical significance, this paper collected clinical features of 40 patients. We observed the expression of P53, MGMT and EGFR in samples using immuohisto-chemistry assay and analyzed their interaction, as well as their relationship to brain glioma. It was found that among 40 cases of brain glioma samples, cases with positive P53 expression accounted for 47.5%, and its expression in high-grade brain glioma was higher than in low-grade brain glioma (P less than 0.05); cases with positive MGMT expression accounted for 37.5%;, and its expression in high-grade glioma and low-grade brain glioma had no statistical significance (P>0.05); cases with positive EGFR expression accounted for 55%, and its expression in high-grade brain glioma was higher than in low-grade brain glioma (P less than 0.05); the expression of P53, MGMT and EGFT were not correlated to age, gender or size of tumor; P53 expression was negatively correlated to MGMT expression (P < 0.05) but positively correlated to EGFR expression (P < 0.05) demonstration that P53, EGFR and MGMT play important roles in the occurrence and development of brain glioma.
25544297	Does smoking affect the Ki67 and p53 expressions in asymptomatic fully impacted lower third molar follicles?	Toptaş O, Baykul T, Başak K.	PURPOSE: Ki67 and p53 protein expressions are the most widely used markers to show the pathologic proliferation and early-stage tumoral alterations in vital tissues. The aim of this study was to compare Ki67 and p53 protein expressions in smokers' and nonsmokers' pericoronal follicles of asymptomatic impacted lower third molars (ILTMs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was planned. The study sample was derived from a population of patients who presented for evaluation and operative treatment of asymptomatic ILTMs. The predictor variable was smoking status, defined as smoker or nonsmoker. Outcome variables were Ki67 and p53 protein expressions in ILTM follicles. Other study variables were age, gender, tooth position, cigarette pack-year, epithelial layer staining, and inflammation. Independent-samples t test analyses were conducted with SPSS 10.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL), with statistical significance set at a P value equal to .05. RESULTS: The study sample was composed of 70 patients (35 in the smoker group) who contributed 60 follicles. There were statistical differences between the 2 groups for variables Ki67 and p53. Mean expression levels of Ki67 were 3.93 ± 2.17 and 2.48 ± 2.09, respectively, for smokers and nonsmokers (P = .011). Mean expression levels of p53 were 5.32 ± 1.98 and 3.06 ± 2.34, respectively, for smokers and nonsmokers (P = .000). CONCLUSION: The present study showed that dental follicles of smokers have higher Ki67 and p53 protein expressions than nonsmokers' follicles.
24635132	Developmental regulation of p53-dependent radiation-induced thymocyte apoptosis in mice.	Gentil Dit Maurin A, Lemercier C, Collin-Faure V, Marche PN, Jouvin-Marche E, Candéias SM.	The production of T cell receptor αβ(+) (TCRαβ(+) ) T lymphocytes in the thymus is a tightly regulated process that can be monitored by the regulated expression of several surface molecules, including CD4, CD8, cKit, CD25 and the TCR itself, after TCR genes have been assembled from discrete V, D (for TCR-β) and J gene segments by a site-directed genetic recombination. Thymocyte differentiation is the result of a delicate balance between cell death and survival: developing thymocytes die unless they receive a positive signal to proceed to the next stage. This equilibrium is altered in response to various physiological or physical stresses such as ionizing radiation, which induces a massive p53-dependent apoptosis of CD4(+) CD8(+) double-positive (DP) thymocytes. Interestingly, these cells are actively rearranging their TCR-α chain genes. To unravel an eventual link between V(D)J recombination activity and thymocyte radio-sensitivity, we analysed the dynamics of thymocyte apoptosis and regeneration following exposure of wild-type and p53-deficient mice to different doses of γ-radiation. p53-dependent radio-sensitivity was already found to be high in immature CD4(-) CD8(-) (double-negative, DN) cKit(+) CD25(+) thymocytes, where TCR-β gene rearrangement is initiated. However, TCR-αβ(-) CD8(+) immature single-positive thymocytes, an actively cycling intermediate population between the DN and DP stages, are the most radio-sensitive cells in the thymus, even though their apoptosis is only partially p53-dependent. Within the DP population, TCR-αβ(+) thymocytes that completed TCR-α gene recombination are more radio-resistant than their TCR-αβ(-) progenitors. Finally, we found no correlation between p53 activation and thymocyte sensitivity to radiation-induced apoptosis.
24858040	The uric acid transporter SLC2A9 is a direct target gene of the tumor suppressor p53 contributing to antioxidant defense.	Itahana Y, Han R, Barbier S, Lei Z, Rozen S, Itahana K.	Only humans and higher primates have high uric acid blood levels. Although high uric acid causes gout, it has been linked with human longevity because of its hypothetical antioxidant function. Recent studies reveal that p53 has significant roles in cellular metabolism. One example of this is an antioxidant function that potentially contributes to tumor suppression. Here, we reported a first beneficial link between p53 and uric acid. We identified the uric acid transporter SLC2A9 (also known as GLUT9) as a direct p53 target gene and a key downstream effector in the reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through transporting uric acid as a source of antioxidant. Oxidative stress induced SLC2A9 expression in a p53-dependent manner, and inhibition of SLC2A9 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) or anti-gout drugs such as probenecid significantly increased ROS levels in an uric acid-dependent manner and greatly sensitized cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. Conversely, expression of SLC2A9 reduced ROS and protected against DNA damage and cell death, suggesting its antioxidant function. The increased production of ROS because of p53 loss was rescued by SLC2A9 expression. Furthermore, decreased SLC2A9 expression was observed in several cancer types and was associated with a poorer prognosis. Our findings suggest that the p53-SLC2A9 pathway is a novel antioxidant mechanism that uses uric acid to maintain ROS homeostasis and prevent accumulation of ROS-associated damage that potentially contributes to cancer development.
25510663	MicroRNA-17 promotes normal ovarian cancer cells to cancer stem cells development via suppression of the LKB1-p53-p21/WAF1 pathway.	Liu T, Qin W, Hou L, Huang Y.	The mechanism underlying the development of human ovarian cancer is poorly understood. The liver kinase protein, LKB1, is hypothesized to play a pivotal role in tumor cell proliferation and invasion capacity through regulation of p53 and p21/WAF1 expression. Previous studies suggest LKB1 may, in turn, be regulated by microRNA-17. Here, we examined the role of miR-17 in the expression of LKB1 and the downstream effects on proliferation and invasion capacity of normal ovarian cancer cells (OCCs) and ovarian stem cells. In this study, both the mRNA and protein expression levels of LKB1, p53, and p21 decreased in OCCs following transfection with a miR-17 expression plasmid. MiR-17 expression affected cell cycle regulation and stimulated the proliferation and invasion capacity of OCCs in vitro. ChIP assays indicated that the binding efficiency of p53 to the p21/WAF1 gene promoter was much lower in miR-17 transfected OCCs than in OCCs transfected with a mutated miR-17. Co-immunoprecipitation and western blotting showed significantly lower levels of p53 and p53 Ser15-pho in the miR-17 transfected OCCs as compared to the mutant miR-17 transfected OCCs. Xenograft experiments confirmed that suppression of tumor growth in vivo occurred in the absence of functional miR-17. These findings suggest that mature miR-17 expression may have an important role in the pathogenesis of human ovarian tumors through its interference with the LKB1-p53-p21/WAF1 pathway expression by epigenetic modification. These findings are of potential importance in the identification of novel therapeutic targets in human ovarian cancer.
25750340	Role of p53 Codon72 SNP in breast cancer risk and anthracycline resistance.	Arfaoui A, Douik H, Kablouti G, Chaaben AB, Handiri N, Zid Z, Ouni N, Zouiouch F, Ayari F, Mamoughli T, Bouassida J, Abazza H, Harzallaha L, Guemira F.	BACKGROUND/AIM: We undertook a case-control and a case-case study to examine the possible association of p53 codon72 polymorphism with the breast cancer risk and resistance to anthracycline-based chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Case-control study: This study enrolled 175 patients with breast cancer treated at the Salah Aziez Institute and 159 healthy Tunisian women (matched for age, ethnicity and origin), used as a control, with no clinical evidence of any neoplastic disorder. Case-Case study: 400 breast cancer patients, with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) treated with anthracycline based-chemotherapy. Genomic DNA was isolated from whole-blood leucocytes using the phenol-chloroform method. Anthracycline response was scored according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. P53 codon72 polymorphism was genotyped using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with the TaqMan method. Data were statistically analyzed using the Chi-square test. RESULTS: Clinical data revealed that among the 400 patients, one quarter was resistant to chemotherapy treatment. Genetic data revealed that the p53 Arg72Pro genotype was found to be greatly associated with breast cancer risk (p<0.001), as well as tumor site (p=0.046). However, resistance to anthracycline-based chemotherapy does not seem to be correlated with p53 codon72 polymorphism in our population. Also, the distribution of tumor size, lymph node involvement and tumor grade was not significantly different among the polymorphic variants. CONCLUSION: We conclude that p53 codon72 polymorphism is involved in susceptibility to developing breast cancer. It may be a factor of progression when breast sites are taken into account. However, there is no evidence indicating that Arg72Pro SNP may influence response to anthracycline-based chemotherapy.
25584637	Oxidation of p53 through DNA charge transport involves a network of disulfides within the DNA-binding domain.	Schaefer KN, Geil WM, Sweredoski MJ, Moradian A, Hess S, Barton JK.	Transcription factor p53 plays a critical role in the cellular response to stress stimuli. We have seen that p53 dissociates selectively from various promoter sites as a result of oxidation at long-range through DNA-mediated charge transport (CT). Here, we examine this chemical oxidation and determine the residues in p53 that are essential for oxidative dissociation, focusing on the network of cysteine residues adjacent to the DNA-binding site. Of the eight mutants studied, only the C275S mutation shows decreased affinity for the Gadd45 promoter site. However, both mutations C275S and C277S result in substantial attenuation of oxidative dissociation, with C275S causing the most severe attenuation. Differential thiol labeling was used to determine the oxidation states of cysteine residues within p53 after DNA-mediated oxidation. Reduced cysteines were iodoacetamide-labeled, whereas oxidized cysteines participating in disulfide bonds were (13)C2D2-iodoacetamide-labeled. Intensities of respective iodoacetamide-modified peptide fragments were analyzed by mass spectrometry. A distinct shift in peptide labeling toward (13)C2D2-iodoacetamide-labeled cysteines is observed in oxidized samples, confirming that chemical oxidation of p53 occurs at long range. All observable cysteine residues trend toward the heavy label under conditions of DNA CT, indicating the formation of multiple disulfide bonds among the cysteine network. On the basis of these data, it is proposed that disulfide formation involving C275 is critical for inducing oxidative dissociation of p53 from DNA.
25810340	Loss of tumour suppressor PTEN expression in renal injury initiates SMAD3- and p53-dependent fibrotic responses.	Samarakoon R, Helo S, Dobberfuhl AD, Khakoo NS, Falke L, Overstreet JM, Goldschmeding R, Higgins PJ.	Deregulation of the tumour suppressor PTEN occurs in lung and skin fibrosis and diabetic and ischaemic renal injury. However, the potential role of PTEN and associated mechanisms in the progression of kidney fibrosis is unknown. Tubular and interstitial PTEN expression was dramatically decreased in several models of renal injury, including aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN), streptozotocin (STZ)-mediated injury and ureteral unilateral obstruction (UUO), correlating with Akt, p53 and SMAD3 activation and fibrosis. Stable silencing of PTEN in HK-2 human tubular epithelial cells induced dedifferentiation and CTGF, PAI-1, vimentin, α-SMA and fibronectin expression, compared to HK-2 cells expressing control shRNA. Furthermore, PTEN knockdown stimulated Akt, SMAD3 and p53(Ser15) phosphorylation, with an accompanying decrease in population density and an increase in epithelial G1 cell cycle arrest. SMAD3 or p53 gene silencing or pharmacological blockade partially suppressed fibrotic gene expression and relieved growth inhibition orchestrated by deficiency or inhibition of PTEN. Similarly, shRNA suppression of PAI-1 rescued the PTEN loss-associated epithelial proliferative arrest. Moreover, TGFβ1-initiated fibrotic gene expression is further enhanced by PTEN depletion. Combined TGFβ1 treatment and PTEN silencing potentiated epithelial cell death via p53-dependent pathways. Thus, PTEN loss initiates tubular dysfunction via SMAD3- and p53-mediated fibrotic gene induction, with accompanying PAI-1-dependent proliferative arrest, and cooperates with TGFβ1 to induce the expression of profibrotic genes and tubular apoptosis.
26359458	Targeting the MDM2/MDM4 Interaction Interface as a Promising Approach for p53 Reactivation Therapy.	Pellegrino M, Mancini F, Lucà R, Coletti A, Giacchè N, Manni I, Arisi I, Florenzano F, Teveroni E, Buttarelli M, Fici L, Brandi R, Bruno T, Fanciulli M, D'Onofrio M, Piaggio G, Pellicciari R, Pontecorvi A, Marine JC, Macchiarulo A, Moretti F.	Restoration of wild-type p53 tumor suppressor function has emerged as an attractive anticancer strategy. Therapeutics targeting the two p53-negative regulators, MDM2 and MDM4, have been developed, but most agents selectively target the ability of only one of these molecules to interact with p53, leaving the other free to operate. Therefore, we developed a method that targets the activity of MDM2 and MDM4 simultaneously based on recent studies indicating that formation of MDM2/MDM4 heterodimer complexes are required for efficient inactivation of p53 function. Using computational and mutagenesis analyses of the heterodimer binding interface, we identified a peptide that mimics the MDM4 C-terminus, competes with endogenous MDM4 for MDM2 binding, and activates p53 function. This peptide induces p53-dependent apoptosis in vitro and reduces tumor growth in vivo. Interestingly, interfering with the MDM2/MDM4 heterodimer specifically activates a p53-dependent oxidative stress response. Consistently, distinct subcellular pools of MDM2/MDM4 complexes were differentially sensitive to the peptide; nuclear MDM2/MDM4 complexes were particularly highly susceptible to the peptide-displacement activity. Taken together, these data identify the MDM2/MDM4 interaction interface as a valuable molecular target for therapeutic reactivation of p53 oncosuppressive function.

25656653	E2F1 and E2F2 prevent replicative stress and subsequent p53-dependent organ involution.	Iglesias-Ara A, Zenarruzabeitia O, Buelta L, Merino J, Zubiaga AM.	Tissue homeostasis requires tight regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. E2F1 and E2F2 transcription factors share a critical role in tissue homeostasis, since their combined inactivation results in overall organ involution, specially affecting the pancreatic gland, which subsequently triggers diabetes. We have examined the mechanism by which these E2Fs regulate tissue homeostasis. We show that pancreas atrophy in E2F1/E2F2 double-knockout (DKO) mice is associated with mitochondrial apoptosis and activation of the p53 pathway in young animals, before the development of diabetes. A deregulated expression of E2F target genes was detected in pancreatic cells of young DKO animals, along with unscheduled DNA replication and activation of a DNA damage response. Importantly, suppression of DNA replication in vivo with aphidicolin led to a significant inhibition of the p53 pathway in DKO pancreas, implying a causal link between DNA replication stress and p53 activation in this model. We further show that activation of the p53 pathway has a key role in the aberrant phenotype of DKO mice, since targeted inactivation of p53 gene abrogated cellular apoptosis and prevented organ involution and insulin-dependent diabetes in mice lacking E2F1/E2F2. Unexpectedly, p53 inactivation unmasked oncogenic features of E2F1/E2F2-depleted cells, as evidenced by an accelerated tumor development in triple-knockout mice compared with p53(-/-) mice. Collectively, our data reveal a role for E2F1 and E2F2 as suppressors of replicative stress in differentiating cells, and uncover the existence of a robust E2F-p53 regulatory axis to enable tissue homeostasis and prevent tumorigenesis. These findings have implications in the design of approaches targeting E2F for cancer therapy.
26456774	Mechanisms of dihydrotestosterone action on resveratrol-induced anti-proliferation in breast cancer cells with different ERα status.	Chin YT, Yang SH, Chang TC, Changou CA, Lai HY, Fu E, HuangFu WC, Davis PJ, Lin HY, Liu LF.	Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) has been shown to promote breast cancer growth via different mechanisms. In addition to binding to ERα, the DHT membrane receptor exists on integrin αvβ3. Resveratrol induces p53-dependent apoptosis via plasma membrane integrin αvβ3. Resveratrol and DHT signals are both transduced by activated ERK1/2; however, DHT promotes cell proliferation in cancer cells, whereas resveratrol is pro-apoptotic. In this study, we examined the mechanism by which DHT inhibits resveratrol-induced apoptosis in human ERα positive (MCF-7) and negative (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells. DHT inhibited resveratrol-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser-15 of p53 in a concentration-dependent manner. These effects of DHT on resveratrol action were blocked by an ERα antagonist, ICI 182,780, in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. DHT inhibited resveratrol-induced nuclear complex of p53-COX-2 formation which is required p53-dependent apoptosis. ChIP studies of COX-2/p53 binding to DNA and expression of p53-responsive genes indicated that DHT inhibited resveratrol-induced p53-directed transcriptional activity. In addition, DHT did inhibit resveratrol-induced COX-2/p53-dependent gene expression. These results suggest that DHT inhibits p53-dependent apoptosis in breast cancer cells by interfering with nuclear COX-2 accumulation which is essential for stimulation of apoptotic pathways. Thus, the surface receptor sites for resveratrol and DHT are discrete and activate ERK1/2-dependent downstream effects on apoptosis that are distinctive. These studies provide new insights into the antagonizing effects of resveratrol versus DHT, an important step toward better understanding and eventually treating breast cancer. It also indicates the complex pathways by which apoptosis is induced by resveratrol in DHT-depleted and -repleted environments.
26598982	Calibration and Optimization of p53, WT1, and Napsin A Immunohistochemistry Ancillary Tests for Histotyping of Ovarian Carcinoma: Canadian Immunohistochemistry Quality Control (CIQC) Experience.	Lee S, Piskorz AM, Le Page C, Mes Masson AM, Provencher D, Huntsman D, Chen W, Swanson PE, Gilks CB, Köbel M.	The Canadian Immunohistochemistry Quality Control provides proficiency testing for immunohistochemistry in Canadian laboratories. Canadian Immunohistochemistry Quality Control Run 42 assessed WT1, Napsin A, and p53; commonly used markers for histotyping ovarian carcinomas. A 42-core tissue microarray, which included the 5 major histotypes of ovarian carcinomas with a subset having known TP53 mutational status, was used for this Canadian Immunohistochemistry Quality Control challenge. Participants included 43 laboratories for p53, 29 for WT1, and 26 for Napsin A. p53 was scored as aberrant if the staining was strong and diffuse or absent. Napsin A and WT1 were scored positive if any tumor cells stained. The reference p53 expression pattern was inferred by TP53 mutation type when available. For WT1, Napsin A, and cases lacking mutational data, the reference staining pattern was based on the majority staining result. The error rate for p53 was 8.8%. Most errors (84%) were due to weak staining. The sensitivity and specificity of aberrant p53 expression for an underlying TP53 mutation was 91.6% and 87.9%, respectively. The error rate for WT1 was 0.76% with all errors occurring in laboratories using the 6F-h2 clone. The average errors for laboratories using 6F-h2 were 2.4 compared with 0 for WT-49. The error rate for Napsin A was 4%. The average errors for laboratories using polyclonal Napsin A were 3 compared with 1.1 for monoclonal Napsin A. Weak p53 staining increases interpretative errors, primarily due to absence of staining in tumors with wild-type TP53. p53 immunohistochemistry correlates strongly with TP53 mutational status. Polyclonal Napsin A and 6F-h2 may lack specificity in comparison to monoclonal Napsin A and WT-49.
26222594	Co-delivery of proapoptotic peptide and p53 DNA by reduction-sensitive polypeptides for cancer therapy.	Chen S, Rong L, Jia HZ, Qin SY, Zeng X, Zhuo RX, Zhang XZ.	In order to produce a more efficient cancer cell death, a dual-functional polypeptide, xPolyR8-KLA(TPP), was synthesized by disulfide cross-linking CR8C and C-KLA(TPP). The obtained xPolyR8-KLA(TPP) could not only initiate tumor cell apoptosis by C-KLA(TPP) with improved cell penetrating ability, but was also capable of loading and delivering the tumor cell suppressing p53 gene. It was found that, after internalization by cancer cells, the xPolyR8-KLA(TPP)/p53 complex released the C-KLA(TPP) moiety and the p53 gene in the cytoplasm due to its reducible disulfide bonds. By regulating both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways, the xPolyR8-KLA(TPP)/p53 complex performed as a synergetic system and lead to a more efficient cancer cell death.
25789029	A preliminary study of the effect of curcumin on the expression of p53 protein in a human multiple myeloma cell line.	Li W, Wang Y, Song Y, Xu L, Zhao J, Fang B.	Curcumin is an inexpensive, natural plant ingredient with protease inhibitor effects. The present study aimed to analyze the inhibitory effects of curcumin on the multiple myeloma (MM) RPMI 8226 cell line, and examine the underlying mechanism that promotes the apoptosis of RPMI 8226 cells. A growth curve was constructed in order to observe the relative growth velocity, and MTT was used to analyze the effect of different concentrations of curcumin on inhibiting the proliferation of the RPMI 8226 cells. The mRNA expression of the p53, Bax and MDM2 genes was detected using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The expression of p53 protein in the MM RPMI 8226 cells following treatment with curcumin was detected by western blotting and ELISA. Curcumin inhibited the proliferation of the MM RPMI 8226 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In the MM RPMI 8226 cells treated with curcumin, the expression of the p53 and Bax genes was upregulated, while the expression of the MDM2 gene was downregulated. p53 protein expression was higher in the curcumin experimental group compared with the control group. Subsequent to treatment with curcumin, the growth of the MM RPMI 8226 cell line was inhibited in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. In the MM RPMI 8226 cells treated with curcumin, p53 protein levels were upregulated, which suggested that curcumin may promote the apoptosis of MM cells by upregulating p53 protein expression.
25808617	Computational analysis of spiro-oxindole inhibitors of the MDM2-p53 interaction: insights and selection of novel inhibitors.	Huang W, Cai L, Chen C, Xie X, Zhao Q, Zhao X, Zhou HY, Han B, Peng C.	Since MDM2 is an inhibitor of the p53 tumor suppressor, disrupting the MDM2-p53 interaction is a promising approach for cancer therapy. Here we used molecular dynamics simulations followed by free energy decomposition analysis to study conformational changes in MDM2 induced by three known spiro-oxindole inhibitors. Analysis of individual energy terms suggests that van der Waals and electrostatic interactions explain much of the binding affinities of these inhibitors. Binding free energies calculated for the three inhibitors using the Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) model were consistent with experimental data, suggesting the validity of this approach. Based on this structure-function analysis, several novel spiro-oxindole derivatives were selected and evaluated for their ability to block the MDM2-p53 interaction in vitro. These results suggest that combining in silico and experimental techniques can provide insights into the structure-function relationships of MDM2 inhibitors and guide the rational design of anticancer drugs targeting the MDM2-p53 interaction.
25868367	[The immunohistochemical features of ovarian serous adenocarcinoma cells, which determine a disease course and survival rates in patients].	Pozharisskiĭ KM, Raskin GA, Vinokurov VL, Iurkova LE, Mukhina MS.	OBJECTIVE: To study a relationship of survival rates to the expression of major genes (p53, PTEN, COX2, pRb and others) involved in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The trial enrolled 23 patients with Stages III-IV ovarian serous adenocarcinoma. Of them, 11 patients showed a long overall survival (median 50 ± 2.5 months), 12 did a short one (14.5 ± 0.7 months). Ovarian adenocarcinomas were high- and low-grade in 20 (87%) and 3 (13%) cases, respectively. RESULTS: Estimating the relationship of the expression of the examined markers and the prognosis of the disease showed that the expression of p53 and Rb was more common in the patients with a short overall survival (median 14.5 versus 50 months; p = 0.03; p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: The expression of mutant p53 protein and that of retinoblastoma (Rb) gene protein are poor prognostic factors for ovarian serous adenocarcinoma.
26032560	The p53 family and the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs): determinants of cancer progression.	Amelio I, Melino G.	HIFs have long been associated with resistance to therapy, metastasis, and poor survival rates in cancer patients. In parallel, although the tumor-suppressor p53 acts as the first barrier against tumor transformation, its inactivation also appears to be crucial for enabling cancer progression at advanced stages. p53 has been proposed to antagonize HIF, and emerging evidence suggests that the p53 siblings p63 and p73 also participate in this interplay. Crosstalk between HIFs and the p53 family acts as a determinant of cancer progression through regulating angiogenesis, the tumor microenvironment, dormancy, metastasis, and recurrence. We discuss the possible mechanisms underlying this regulation and the controversies in this field in an attempt to provide a unified view of current knowledge.
25388787	Searching for Dual Inhibitors of the MDM2-p53 and MDMX-p53 Protein-Protein Interaction by a Scaffold-Hopping Approach.	Zaytsev A, Dodd B, Magnani M, Ghiron C, Golding BT, Griffin RJ, Liu J, Lu X, Micco I, Newell DR, Padova A, Robertson G, Lunec J, Hardcastle IR.	Two libraries of substituted benzimidazoles were designed using a 'scaffold-hopping' approach based on reported MDM2-p53 inhibitors. Substituents were chosen following library enumeration and docking into an MDM2 X-ray structure. Benzimidazole libraries were prepared using an efficient solution-phase approach and screened for inhibition of the MDM2-p53 and MDMX-p53 protein-protein interactions. Key examples showed inhibitory activity against both targets.
25611347	Quinofuracins A-E, produced by the fungus Staphylotrichum boninense PF1444, show p53-dependent growth suppression.	Tatsuda D, Momose I, Someno T, Sawa R, Kubota Y, Iijima M, Kunisada T, Watanabe T, Shibasaki M, Nomoto A.	Quinofuracins A-E, novel anthraquinone derivatives containing β-D-galactofuranose that were isolated from the fungus Staphylotrichum boninense PF1444, induced p53-dependent cell death in human tumor cells. The structures of quinofuracins A-E, including absolute configurations, were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis and chemical transformation studies. Quinofuracins were classified into three groups according to the aglycone moieties. 5'-Oxoaverantin was present in quinofuracins A-C, whereas averantin and versicolorin B were identified in quinofuracins D and E, respectively. These quinofuracins induced p53-dependent growth suppression in human glioblastoma LNZTA3 cells.
25644651	Chalcoplatin, a dual-targeting and p53 activator-containing anticancer platinum(IV) prodrug with unique mode of action.	Ma L, Ma R, Wang Y, Zhu X, Zhang J, Chan HC, Chen X, Zhang W, Chiu SK, Zhu G.	Complexation of cisplatin with a p53 activator as a single anticancer agent resulted in synergistically improved cytotoxicity in p53 wild-type but not p53 null human cancer cells. Mechanistic investigation was carried out on this dual-targeting Pt(IV) prodrug, chalcoplatin. The prodrug effectively entered cancer cells and arrested the cell cycle at the S and G2/M phases, distinctive of that from cisplatin. Chalcoplatin significantly induced p53 activation as well as the subsequent apoptosis pathways. This unique mode of action renders chalcoplatin remarkably cytotoxic and makes this compound among the first examples of a Pt(IV) prodrug that directly interacts with the downstream pathway after the formation of Pt-DNA lesions.
26388570	Role of JNK and Contribution of p53 to the Realization of the Growth Potential of Mesenchymal Precursor Cells under the Effect of Fibroblast Growth Factor.	Zyuz'kov GN, Zhdanov VV, Udut EV, Miroshnichenko LA, Khrichkova TY, Danilets MG, Simanina EV, Chaikovskii AV, Agafonov VI, Sherstoboev EY, Minakova MY, Burmina YV, Udut VV, Dygai AM.	The role of JNK-mediated signal pathway and participation of p53 transcription factor in stimulation of mesenchymal precursor cell function by the fibroblast growth factor was studied. The levels of fibroblast colony- and cluster formation and proliferative activity of mesenchymal precursors increased in response to JNK and p53 specific inhibitors. JNK and p53 blockers did not change the rate of fibroblast growth factor-induced progenitor element differentiation.
26423086	Non-viral Delivery Systems for the Application in p53 Cancer Gene Therapy.	Wang K, Huang Q, Qiu F, Sui M.	A key barrier to the development of gene therapy remains the lack of safe, efficient and easily controllable vehicles for gene delivery. The fundamental problems associated with the viral vehicles, e.g. lack of specificity and immunogenic potential, have driven the development of non-viral systems of gene delivery. In the last decade, studies on p53 gene replacement therapy have dominated the literature. Although clinical trials of p53 gene therapy have achieved limited success, it remains the only tumor suppressor gene to be evaluated formally in clinical trials for cancer treatment, with increasing focus on delivery using non-viral systems. In this article, we particularly review current investigations on p53 gene delivery using non-viral methods, including both physical and chemical approaches, with an emphasis on the latter. The existing opportunities and challenges for successful p53 cancer gene therapy are also discussed.
26170095	Modelling the molecular mechanism of protein-protein interactions and their inhibition: CypD-p53 case study.	Fayaz SM, Rajanikant GK.	Cyclophilin D (CypD) is an important regulatory protein involved in mitochondrial membrane permeability transition and cell death. Further, the mitochondrial CypD-p53 axis is an important contributor to necroptosis, a form of programmed necrosis, involved in various cardiovascular and neurological disorders. The CypD ligand, Cyclosporin A (CsA), was identified as an inhibitor of this interaction. In this study, using computational methods, we have attempted to model the CypD-p53 interaction in order to delineate their mode of binding and also to disclose the molecular mechanism, by means of which CsA interferes with this interaction. It was observed that p53 binds at the CsA-binding site of CypD. The knowledge obtained from this modelling was employed to identify novel CypD inhibitors through structure-based methods. Further, the identified compounds were tested by a similar strategy, adopted during the modelling process. This strategy could be applied to study the mechanism of protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibition and to identify novel PPI inhibitors.
26230405	microRNA-21 Regulates Cell Proliferation and Migration and Cross Talk with PTEN and p53 in Bladder Cancer.	Lei M, Xie W, Sun E, Sun Y, Tian D, Liu C, Han R, Li N, Liu M, Han R, Liu L.	This study aimed to determine the molecular mechanism by which the oncogenic micoRNA-21 (miR-21) functions in bladder cancer. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that the expression of miR-21 considerably increased in primary cancer tissue compared with that in the paired adjacent noncancerous tissue and that in normal bladder mucosa. Knockdown of miR-21 by using antisense oligonucleotide significantly suppressed the proliferation and migration of bladder cancer cells (J82 and RT112). Mechanism studies showed that downregulation of miR-21 resulted in cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase and upregulation of the tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue) and p53 phosphorylation at Ser46. The p53 phosphorylation at Ser15 and the whole level of p53 acetylation remained unchanged in response to miR-21 knockdown. MicroRNA-21 regulates proliferation and migration of bladder cancer cells and cross talk with PTEN and p53 in bladder cancer.
26278643	Dynamics of P53 in response to DNA damage: Mathematical modeling and perspective.	Sun T, Cui J.	Cells are constantly challenged by intrinsic and extrinsic signals. DNA damage denotes a serious threat to cellular survival due to its extensive destroy to genomic integrity. Appropriate dynamic responses to changing signals are essential for homeostasis. The tumor suppressor p53 can respond to DNA damage and elicit diverse dynamical patterns. How signals and information are encoded and decoded in p53 network under DNA damaging stimuli are not fully understood. From theoretical perspective, we focus on the dynamical patterns of p53 and how such complex dynamics relate to cell fate leading to a better knowledge about its regulation and function.
26431790	Neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia increases neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus through the HIF-1α and p53 pathways.	Yin R, Yuan L, Ping L, Hu L.	Neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) might lead to an increased risk for brain injury. The present study aims to investigate the effects of neonatal BPD on neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus and cognitive function and to explore the underlying mechanisms. The results revealed that BPD model rat pups exhibited more apoptotic cells in the hippocampus and longer escape latencies in the Morris maze test. Both the caspase-dependent and caspase-nondependent signal pathways were activated. Further examinations showed an elevated p53 level by BPD via HIF-1α induction, while the caspase-3 in the hippocampus was suppressed by both HIF-1α and p53 inhibitor. These findings suggested that neonatal BPD caused impaired cognitive function and neuron apoptosis in hippocampus via p53 and HIF-1α. Although the precise mechanism requires further investigation, this study provided new evidence for and an explanation of the impaired CNS developmental outcomes of BPD.
26299837	Multi-scale modeling of cell survival and death mediated by the p53 network: a systems pharmacology framework.	Wang Y, Guo Z, Chen X, Zhang W, Lu A, Wang Y.	The determination of cell fate is a key regulatory process for the development of complex organisms that are controlled by distinct genes in mammalian cells. To interpret the decision process in a rigorous, analytical framework, we performed a multi-scale simulation of cell fate decision mediated by the p53 regulatory network in a systems pharmacology framework. The model treats fate determination as a gradual response to stress that delays the initiation of apoptosis to give the cell an opportunity to survive. The newly proposed two-factor model: DNA-p53 coupling explains the phenomenon of the existing biological responses to stress damage for the p53 regulatory network. In addition, the model also reveals that the cell survival rate can be improved by lowering the p53 level in a feedback network to increase its robustness for external stimuli. The present work not only deepens our understanding of cell fate determination, but also provides a theoretical basis for rational drug discovery and development.
26477309	Sp100A is a tumor suppressor that activates p53-dependent transcription and counteracts E1A/E1B-55K-mediated transformation.	Berscheminski J, Brun J, Speiseder T, Wimmer P, Ip WH, Terzic M, Dobner T, Schreiner S.	Human adenoviruses (HAdV) are used as a model system to investigate tumorigenic processes in mammalian cells where the viral oncoproteins E1A and E1B-55K are absolutely required for oncogenic transformation, because they simultaneously accelerate cell cycle progression and inhibit tumor suppressor proteins such as p53, although the underlying mechanism is still not understood in detail. In our present study, we provide evidence that E1B-55K binding to the PML-NB component Sp100A apparently has an essential role in regulating adenovirus-mediated transformation processes. Specifically, when this E1B-55K/Sp100A complex recruits p53, Sp100A-induced activation of p53 transcriptional activity is effectively abolished. Hence, Sp100A exhibits tumor-suppressive activity, not only by stabilizing p53 transactivation but also by depressing E1A/E1B-55K-mediated transformation. E1B-55K counteracts this suppressive activity, inducing Sp100A SUMOylation and sequestering the modified cellular factor into the insoluble matrix of the nucleus or into cytoplasmic inclusions. These observations provide novel insights into how E1B-55K modulates cellular determinants to maintain growth-promoting activity during oncogenic processes and lytic infection.Oncogene advance online publication, 19 October 2015; doi:10.1038/onc.2015.378.
26505381	Gli1 expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and its clinical significance.	Abula Y, Yi C, Wang XY, Wang M, Qin RY, Guo YQ, Lin H, Li HJ.	The aim of this study was to explore the correlation between the expression levels of Gli1 and p53 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and its pathological significance. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was employed to measure the expression level of Gli1 and p53 in 85 sets of paraffin-embedded PDAC and corresponding para-carcinoma tissue specimens. The relationship between these results and the respective patients' clinicopathologic parameters was analyzed. IHC staining revealed that the expression levels of Gli1 and p53 in cancer tissues were evidently higher than that of para-carcinoma tissues (P < 0.05); while Gli1 expression levels correlated with the corresponding TNM stage and tumor infiltration depth, p53 expression level correlated with the respective TNM stage (P < 0.05). Taken together, this study demonstrates increased expression of Gli1 and p53 in PDAC, and proves that Gli1 could be apotential biomarker for prognostic judgment.
26141769	Discovery of dihydroisoquinolinone derivatives as novel inhibitors of the p53-MDM2 interaction with a distinct binding mode.	Gessier F, Kallen J, Jacoby E, Chène P, Stachyra-Valat T, Ruetz S, Jeay S, Holzer P, Masuya K, Furet P.	Blocking the interaction between the p53 tumor suppressor and its regulatory protein MDM2 is a promising therapeutic concept under current investigation in oncology drug research. We report here the discovery of the first representatives of a new class of small molecule inhibitors of this protein-protein interaction: the dihydroisoquinolinones. Starting from an initial hit identified by virtual screening, a derivatization program has resulted in compound 11, a low nanomolar inhibitor of the p53-MDM2 interaction showing significant cellular activity. Initially based on a binding mode hypothesis, this effort was then guided by a X-ray co-crystal structure of MDM2 in complex with one of the synthesized analogs. The X-ray structure revealed an unprecedented binding mode for p53-MDM2 inhibitors.
24986024	ROS and p53 in regulation of UVB-induced HDM2 alternative splicing.	Tong L, Wu S.	Alternative splicing plays an important role in proteasome diversity and gene expression regulation in eukaryotic cells. Hdm2, the human homolog of mdm2 (murine double minute oncogene 2), is known to be an oncogene as its role in suppression of p53. Hdm2 alternative splicing, occurs in both tumor and normal tissues, is believed to be a response of cells for cellular stress, and thus modulate p53 activity. Therefore, understanding the regulation of hdm2 splicing is critical in elucidating the mechanisms of tumor development and progression. In this study, we determined the effect of ultraviolet B light (UVB) on alternative splicing of hdm2. Our data indicated that UVB (50 mJ cm(-2)) alone is not a good inducer of alternative splicing of hdm2. The less effectiveness could be due to the induction of ROS and p53 by UVB because removing ROS by L-NAC (10 mm) in p53 null cells could lead to alternative splicing of hdm2 upon UVB irradiation.
26522723	The homeoprotein DLX3 and tumor suppressor p53 co-regulate cell cycle progression and squamous tumor growth.	Palazzo E, Kellett M, Cataisson C, Gormley A, Bible PW, Pietroni V, Radoja N, Hwang J, Blumenberg M, Yuspa SH, Morasso MI.	Epidermal homeostasis depends on the coordinated control of keratinocyte cell cycle. Differentiation and the alteration of this balance can result in neoplastic development. Here we report on a novel DLX3-dependent network that constrains epidermal hyperplasia and squamous tumorigenesis. By integrating genetic and transcriptomic approaches, we demonstrate that DLX3 operates through a p53-regulated network. DLX3 and p53 physically interact on the p21 promoter to enhance p21 expression. Elevating DLX3 in keratinocytes produces a G1-S blockade associated with p53 signature transcriptional profiles. In contrast, DLX3 loss promotes a mitogenic phenotype associated with constitutive activation of ERK. DLX3 expression is lost in human skin cancers and is extinguished during progression of experimentally induced mouse squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Reinstatement of DLX3 function is sufficient to attenuate the migration of SCC cells, leading to decreased wound closure. Our data establish the DLX3-p53 interplay as a major regulatory axis in epidermal differentiation and suggest that DLX3 is a modulator of skin carcinogenesis.Oncogene advance online publication, 2 November 2015; doi:10.1038/onc.2015.380.
26548915	Modulation of p53 during bacterial infections.	Siegl C, Rudel T.	In recent years, numerous bacterial pathogens have been shown to inactivate the major tumour suppressor p53 during infection. This inactivation impedes the protective response of the host cell to the genotoxicity that often results from bacterial infection. Moreover, a new aspect of the antibacterial activity of p53 that has recently come to light - downregulation of host cell metabolism to interfere with intracellular bacterial replication - has further highlighted the crucial role of p53 in host-pathogen interactions, as host cell metabolism is relevant for all intracellular bacteria, as well as other pathogens that replicate inside host cells and use host metabolites. In this Progress article, we summarize recent work that has advanced our knowledge of the interaction between pathogenic bacteria and p53, and we discuss the known and expected outcomes of this interaction for pathogenesis.
26567881	Targeting MDM4 as a Novel Therapeutic Approach for Hematologic Malignancies.	Cao L, Fan L, Xu W, Li JY.	Mouse double minute 4 (MDM4) as a member of MDM family, is an oncogene emerging as an imperative negative regulator of p53. Tumor suppressor protein p53 plays a crucial role in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and homeostasis. It has been reported that frequent inactivation of p53 was observed in numerous human cancers including hematologic malignancies. MDM4, the newly discovered modulator of p53 protein, is frequently amplified in various solid tumors such as cutaneous melanoma, retinoblastoma and hematological malignances such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma. Multiple evidences implicate that over-expression of MDM4 is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis which can be reversed by knockdown of MDM4 expression or restoration of p53 function, and support the rationale for the design of future MDM4-specific therapeutics. This article discusses and focuses on using MDM4 as a novel biomarker as well as a therapeutic target for hematologic malignancies.
26571802	[Dynamics of changes of p53-positive cells morphofunctional condition in the cerebral cortex of the temporal lobe in rats affected by carotid ischemia-reperfusion].	Kmet TI, Tkachuk SS.	The influence of bilateral 20-minute carotid ischemia with reperfusion of various duration upon the activity of apoptotic processes in the neurons and glia cells of the cerebral cortex in the temporal lobe of rats has been studied. Bilateral carotid ischemia with one-hour reperjusion has been indicated to increase the location density of p53+-neurocytes in this region of the cerebral cortex, increases percentage and density of p53+-nerve cells and reduces the percentage and density of p53+-glia cells on the 12th day of the post-ischemic period. Ischemic-reperfusion lesion of the brain increases the concentration of p53 protein in glia cells of the cerebral cortex in the temporal region in the early ischemic-reperfusion period and reduces it in nerve and glia cells in the late one.
26595307	The prognostic value of p53 expression for patients with cervical cancer: a meta analysis.	Zhou R, Wei C, Liu J, Luo Y, Tang W.	A number of studies have evaluated the association of p53 expression with the cervical cancer clinical outcome, but the results were inconsistent.Electronic search of PubMed was conducted to select studies. Studies which quantitatively evaluated the relationship between p53 expression and survival of the patients with cervical cancer were chosen, and hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to assess the association.The final meta-analysis contained 11 published studies including 1105 patients. Combined HRs suggested that p53 overexpression has an unfavorable impact on overall survival(OS) [HR=1.672, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.144-2.444, P=0.008], and Caucasian cervical cancer patients OS[HR=1.942, 95% CI: 1.162-3.245, P=0.011].p53 expression indicates a poor prognosis for Caucasian people with cervical cancer.
25825738	Autoinhibition of MDMX by intramolecular p53 mimicry.	Chen L, Borcherds W, Wu S, Becker A, Schonbrunn E, Daughdrill GW, Chen J.	The p53 inhibitor MDMX is controlled by multiple stress signaling pathways. Using a proteolytic fragment release (PFR) assay, we detected an intramolecular interaction in MDMX that mechanistically mimics the interaction with p53, resulting in autoinhibition of MDMX. This mimicry is mediated by a hydrophobic peptide located in a long disordered central segment of MDMX that has sequence similarity to the p53 transactivation domain. NMR spectroscopy was used to show this hydrophobic peptide interacts with the N-terminal domain of MDMX in a structurally analogous manner to p53. Mutation of two critical tryptophan residues in the hydrophobic peptide disrupted the intramolecular interaction and increased p53 binding, providing further evidence for mechanistic mimicry. The PFR assay also revealed a second intramolecular interaction between the RING domain and central region that regulates MDMX nuclear import. These results establish the importance of intramolecular interactions in MDMX regulation, and validate a new assay for the study of intramolecular interactions in multidomain proteins with intrinsically disordered regions.
26384650	Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) phosphorylates p53 and induces p21(WAF1/CIP1) expression.	Ho DH, Kim H, Kim J, Sim H, Ahn H, Kim J, Seo H, Chung KC, Park BJ, Son I, Seol W.	Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a gene in which a mutation causes Parkinson's disease (PD), and p53 is a prototype tumor suppressor. In addition, activation of p53 in patient with PD has been reported by several studies. Because phosphorylation of p53 is critical for regulating its activity and LRRK2 is a kinase, we tested whether p53 is phosphorylated by LRRK2.LRRK2 phosphorylates threonine (Thr) at TXR sites in an in vitro kinase assay, and the T304 and T377 were identified as putative phosphorylated residues. An increase of phospho-Thr in the p53 TXR motif was confirmed in the cells overexpressing G2019S, and human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells of a G2019S carrier. Interactions between LRRK2 and p53 were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of lysates of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. LRRK2 mediated p53 phosphorylation translocalizes p53 predominantly to nucleus and increases p21(WAF1/CIP1) expression in SH-SY5Y cells based on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot assay results. The luciferase assay using the p21(WAF1/CIP1) promoter-reporter also confirmed that LRRK2 kinase activity increases p21 expression. Exogenous expression of G2019S and the phosphomimetic p53 T304/377D mutants increased expression of p21(WAF1/CIP1) and cleaved PARP, and cytotoxicity in the same cells. We also observed increase of p21 expression in rat primary neuron cells after transient expression of p53 T304/377D mutants and the mid-brain lysates of the G2019S transgenic mice.p53 is a LRRK2 kinase substrate. Phosphorylation of p53 by LRRK2 induces p21(WAF1/CIP1) expression and apoptosis in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells and rat primary neurons.
25755833	Low miR-34a and miR-192 are associated with unfavorable prognosis in patients suffering from osteosarcoma.	Wang Y, Jia LS, Yuan W, Wu Z, Wang HB, Xu T, Sun JC, Cheng KF, Shi JG.	BACKGROUND: p53 is a well-known tumor suppressor gene involved in malignancy. Many microRNAs (miRNAs) have recently been identified as key components of p53 signaling networks, owing to the central role of p53 in many processes, these p53-regulated miRNAs may possess important role in osteosarcoma. METHODS: The expression of six p53-related miRNAs (miR-34 family [including miR-34a, 34b and 34c], miR-31, miR-192, and miR-215) in 80 pairs of osteosarcoma and corresponding noncancerous bone tissues were estimated by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and the associations of miRNAs expression with clinicopathological factors, p53 status, and survival of patients were analyzed. RESULTS: We found that among all six miRNAs, miR-34 family, -192, and -215 had decreased levels, whereas the level of miR-31 was increased (p<0.05) in tumor compared with corresponding noncancerous bone tissues, and miR-192/215 in patients with p53 positive expression was lower than those with negative p53. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that osteosarcoma patients with low miR-34a (P=0.000) and miR-192 (P=0.022) expression had poorer disease-free survival (DFS). Moreover, disease-free survival (DFS) was shorter for patients with low miR-34a and miR-192 expression (P=0.007) and the combination of low miR-192 with p53 positive expression (P=0.000). Furthermore, the multivariate analysis identified that low miR-34a expression, the combination of low miR-34a and miR-192 expression levels and the combination of low miR-192 with p53 positive were independent biomarkers of shorter DFS. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results suggest that p53-associated miR-34a and miR-192 expression could be novel prognosis biomarkers for surgically treated osteosarcoma.
26070072	Significant Differences in the Development of Acquired Resistance to the MDM2 Inhibitor SAR405838 between In Vitro and In Vivo Drug Treatment.	Hoffman-Luca CG, Yang CY, Lu J, Ziazadeh D, McEachern D, Debussche L, Wang S.	SAR405838 is a potent and specific MDM2 inhibitor currently being evaluated in Phase I clinical trials for the treatment of human cancer. Using the SJSA-1 osteosarcoma cell line which harbors an amplified MDM2 gene and wild-type p53, we have investigated the acquired resistance mechanisms both in vitro and in vivo to SAR405838. Treatment of SJSA-1 cells with SAR405838 in vitro leads to dose-dependent cell growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest and robust apoptosis. However, prolonged treatment of SJSA-1 cells in vitro with SAR405838 results in profound acquired resistance to the drug. Analysis of in vitro-derived resistant cell lines showed that p53 is mutated in the DNA binding domain and can no longer be activated by SAR405838. Treatment of the parental SJSA-1 xenograft tumors with SAR405838 in mice yields rapid tumor regression but the tumors eventually regrow. Culturing the regrown tumors established a number of sublines, which showed only modest (3-5 times) loss of sensitivity to SAR405838 in vitro. Sequencing of the p53 showed that it retains its wild-type status in these in vivo sublines, with the exception of one subline, which harbors a single heterozygous C176F p53 mutation. Using xenograft models of two in vivo derived sublines, which has either wild-type p53 or p53 containing a single heterozygous C176F mutation, we showed that while SAR405838 effectively achieves partial tumor regression in these models, it no longer induces complete tumor regression and tumors resume growth once the treatment is stopped. Harvesting and culturing tumors obtained from a prolonged treatment with SAR405838 in mice established additional in vivo sublines, which all contain a single heterozygous C176F mutation with no additional p53 mutation detected. Interestingly, SAR405838 can still effectively activate p53 in all sublines containing a single heterozygous C176F mutation, with a moderately reduced potency as compared to that in the parental cell line. Consistently, SAR405838 is 3-5 times less effective in all the in vivo derived sublines containing a single heterozygous C176F p53 mutation than in the SJSA-1 parental cell line in assays of cell growth and apoptosis. Computational modeling suggested that a p53 tetramer containing two wild-type p53 molecules and two C176F mutated molecules can maintain the structural stability and interactions with DNA by formation of additional hydrophobic and cation-π interactions which compensate for the loss of sulphur-zinc coordination. Our data thus show that SJSA-1 tumor cells acquire very different levels of resistance in vitro and in vivo to the MDM2 inhibitor SAR405838. Our present study may have a significant implication for the investigation of resistant mechanisms for other classes of anticancer drugs.
25534115	ASPP2 enhances oxaliplatin (L-OHP)-induced colorectal cancer cell apoptosis in a p53-independent manner by inhibiting cell autophagy.	Shi Y, Han Y, Xie F, Wang A, Feng X, Li N, Guo H, Chen D.	Inactivation of p53-mediated cell death pathways is a central component of cancer progression. ASPP2 (apoptosis stimulated protein of p53-2) is a p53 binding protein that specially stimulates pro-apoptosis function of p53. Down-regulation of ASPP2 is observed in many human cancers and is associated with poor prognosis and metastasis. In this study, ASPP2 was found to enhance L-OHP-induced apoptosis in HCT116 p53(-/-) cells in a p53-independent manner. Such apoptosis-promoting effect of ASPP2 was achieved by inhibiting autophagy. Further experiments with ASPP2 RNA interference and autophagy inhibitor (3-methyladenine, 3-MA) confirmed that ASPP2 enhanced HCT116 p53(-/-) cell apoptosis via inhibiting the autophagy. The association of cell death and autophagy was also found in ASPP2(+/-) mice, where colon tissue with reduced ASPP2 expression displayed more autophagy and less cell death. Finally, colorectal tumours and their adjacent normal tissues from 20 colorectal cancer patients were used to examine ASPP2 expression, p53 expression and p53 mutation, to understand their relationships with the patients' outcome. Three site mutations were found in p53 transcripts from 16 of 20 patients. ASPP2 mRNA expressions were higher, and autophagy level was lower in the adjacent normal tissues, compared with the tumour tissues, which was independent of both p53 mutation and expression level. Taken together, ASPP2 increased tumour sensitivity to chemotherapy via inhibiting autophagy in a p53-independent manner, which was associated with the tumour formation, suggesting that both p53 inactivation and ASPP2 expression level were involved in the sensitivity of colorectal cancer to chemotherapy.
26024390	TP53: an oncogene in disguise.	Soussi T, Wiman KG.	The standard classification used to define the various cancer genes confines tumor protein p53 (TP53) to the role of a tumor suppressor gene. However, it is now an indisputable fact that many p53 mutants act as oncogenic proteins. This statement is based on multiple arguments including the mutation signature of the TP53 gene in human cancer, the various gains-of-function (GOFs) of the different p53 mutants and the heterogeneous phenotypes developed by knock-in mouse strains modeling several human TP53 mutations. In this review, we will shatter the classical and traditional image of tumor protein p53 (TP53) as a tumor suppressor gene by emphasizing its multiple oncogenic properties that make it a potential therapeutic target that should not be underestimated. Analysis of the data generated by the various cancer genome projects highlights the high frequency of TP53 mutations and reveals that several p53 hotspot mutants are the most common oncoprotein variants expressed in several types of tumors. The use of Muller's classical definition of mutations based on quantitative and qualitative consequences on the protein product, such as 'amorph', 'hypomorph', 'hypermorph' 'neomorph' or 'antimorph', allows a more meaningful assessment of the consequences of cancer gene modifications, their potential clinical significance, and clearly demonstrates that the TP53 gene is an atypical cancer gene.
25668429	Evolution of p53 transactivation specificity through the lens of a yeast-based functional assay.	Lion M, Raimondi I, Donati S, Jousson O, Ciribilli Y, Inga A.	Co-evolution of transcription factors (TFs) with their respective cis-regulatory network enhances functional diversity in the course of evolution. We present a new approach to investigate transactivation capacity of sequence-specific TFs in evolutionary studies. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used as an in vivo test tube and p53 proteins derived from human and five commonly used animal models were chosen as proof of concept. p53 is a highly conserved master regulator of environmental stress responses. Previous reports indicated conserved p53 DNA binding specificity in vitro, even for evolutionary distant species. We used isogenic yeast strains where p53-dependent transactivation was measured towards chromosomally integrated p53 response elements (REs). Ten REs were chosen to sample a wide range of DNA binding affinity and transactivation capacity for human p53 and proteins were expressed at two levels using an inducible expression system. We showed that the assay is amenable to study thermo-sensitivity of frog p53, and that chimeric constructs containing an ectopic transactivation domain could be rapidly developed to enhance the activity of proteins, such as fruit fly p53, that are poorly effective in engaging the yeast transcriptional machinery. Changes in the profile of relative transactivation towards the ten REs were measured for each p53 protein and compared to the profile obtained with human p53. These results, which are largely independent from relative p53 protein levels, revealed widespread evolutionary divergence of p53 transactivation specificity, even between human and mouse p53. Fruit fly and human p53 exhibited the largest discrimination among REs while zebrafish p53 was the least selective.
26077467	Programmed cell death 5 mediates HDAC3 decay to promote genotoxic stress response.	Choi HK, Choi Y, Park ES, Park SY, Lee SH, Seo J, Jeong MH, Jeong JW, Jeong JH, Lee PC, Choi KC, Yoon HG.	The inhibition of p53 activity by histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) has been reported, but the precise molecular mechanism is unknown. Here we show that programmed cell death 5 (PDCD5) selectively mediates HDAC3 dissociation from p53, which induces HDAC3 cleavage and ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. Casein kinase 2 alpha phosphorylates PDCD5 at Ser-119 to enhance its stability and importin 13-mediated nuclear translocation of PDCD5. Genetic deletion of PDCD5 abrogates etoposide (ET)-induced p53 stabilization and HDAC3 cleavage, indicating an essential role of PDCD5 in p53 activation. Restoration of PDCD5(WT) in PDCD5(-/-) MEFs restores ET-induced HDAC3 cleavage. Reduction of both PDCD5 and p53, but not reduction of either protein alone, significantly enhances in vivo tumorigenicity of AGS gastric cancer cells and correlates with poor prognosis in gastric cancer patients. Our results define a mechanism for p53 activation via PDCD5-dependent HDAC3 decay under genotoxic stress conditions.
25582697	PRMT5 is required for lymphomagenesis triggered by multiple oncogenic drivers.	Li Y, Chitnis N, Nakagawa H, Kita Y, Natsugoe S, Yang Y, Li Z, Wasik M, Klein-Szanto AJ, Rustgi AK, Diehl JA.	Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) has been implicated as a key modulator of lymphomagenesis. Whether PRMT5 has overt oncogenic function in the context of leukemia/lymphoma and whether it represents a therapeutic target remains to be established. We demonstrate that inactivation of PRMT5 inhibits colony-forming activity by multiple oncogenic drivers, including cyclin D1, c-MYC, NOTCH1, and MLL-AF9. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PRMT5 overexpression specifically cooperates with cyclin D1 to drive lymphomagenesis in a mouse model, revealing inherent neoplastic activity. Molecular analysis of lymphomas revealed that arginine methylation of p53 selectively suppresses expression of crucial proapoptotic and antiproliferative target genes, thereby sustaining tumor cell self-renewal and proliferation and bypassing the need for the acquisition of inactivating p53 mutations. Critically, analysis of human tumor specimens reveals a strong correlation between cyclin D1 overexpression and p53 methylation, supporting the biomedical relevance of this pathway.We have identified and functionally validated a crucial role for PRMT5 for the inhibition of p53-dependent tumor suppression in response to oncogenic insults. The requisite role for PRMT5 in the context of multiple lymphoma/leukemia oncogenic drivers suggests a molecular rationale for therapeutic development.
26112108	Role of JNK and Contribution of p53 into Growth Potential of Mesenchymal Progenitor Cells In Vitro.	Zyuz'kov GN, Zhdanov VV, Udut EV, Miroshnichenko LA, Danilets MG, Simanina EV, Trofimova ES, Chaikovskii AV, Agafonov VI, Sherstoboev EY, Minakova MY, Burmina YV, Udut VV, Dygai AM.	Specific JNK and p53 inhibitors stimulated the formation of fibroblast colonies (CFU-F) and clusters (ClFU-F) and increased proliferative activity of mesenchymal progenitor cells. No effects of inhibitors of JNK and p53 on differentiation of progenitor elements were revealed.
25921402	Small-molecule MDM2-p53 inhibitors: recent advances.	Zhang B, Golding BT, Hardcastle IR.	Potent and selective small-molecule inhibitors of the p53-MDM2 interaction intended for the treatment of p53 wild-type tumors have been designed and optimized in a number of chemical series. This review details recent disclosures of compounds in advanced optimization and features key series that have given rise to clinical trial candidates. The structure-activity relationships for inhibitor classes are discussed with reference to x-ray structures, and common structural features are identified.
25226874	A fluorescent probe for imaging p53-MDM2 protein-protein interaction.	Liu Z, Miao Z, Li J, Fang K, Zhuang C, Du L, Sheng C, Li M.	In this article, we describe a no-wash small-molecule fluorescent probe for detecting and imaging p53-MDM2 protein-protein interaction based on an environment-sensitive fluorescent turn-on mechanism. After extensive biological examination, this probe L1 exhibited practical activity and selectivity in vitro and in cellulo.
25016051	Relationship of p53 accumulation in peripheral tissues of high-fat diet-induced obese rats with decrease in metabolic and oncogenic signaling of insulin.	Homayounfar R, Jeddi-Tehrani M, Cheraghpour M, Ghorbani A, Zand H.	This paper aimed to explore the role of p53 in adipose and some other peripheral tissues of a diet-induced obese model and targeted it using pharmacological approach to ameliorate diet-induced insulin resistance. Five week old male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups and fed on low-fat diet (13% control lean group), high-fat diet (41% obese group), or high-fat diet plus a single dose of pifithrin-α in the end of experiments (PFT group). Insulin, glucose, and other serum parameters were analyzed by standard colorimetric kits. Protein levels were evaluated by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence methods. After 12weeks, both body weight and insulin resistance were significantly higher in obese rats than in the control ones. P53 and PTEN protein levels were markedly elevated in peripheral tissues in addition to adipose tissues. AKT activation was decreased in the peripheral tissues of obese rats and was in correlation with the increase of p53 and PTEN level. Systemic pifithrin-α administration considerably diminished p53 levels and ameliorated AKT phosphorylation in all peripheral tissues including adipose tissues. Interestingly, the systemic inhibition of p53 was in correlation with improving insulin glucose at serum level. The present results clearly showed that p53 activation in peripheral tissues was in correlation with decreased insulin action. These results indicated p53 activation in the peripheral tissues of obese subjects as a protective mechanism against chronic insulin elevation, suggested that p53 could be a new target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
26464702	Immunohistochemistry of p53 and Ki-67 and p53 mutation analysis in renal epithelioid angiomyolipoma.	Li W, Guo L, Bi X, Ma J, Zheng S.	Backgound: Renal epithelioid angiomyolipoma (EAML) is a rare variant of AML (angiomyolipoma) and is often associated with aggressive behaviors. The pathogenesis of EAML has been poorly understood. We analyzed the expression of p53 and Ki-67 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and investigated p53 mutation analysis in 11 cases of EAML in comparison to classical AML.P53 and Ki-67 expression status were determined by IHC staining. P53 mutation analysis was performed using bi-directional sequencing.Renal EAML tumors were significantly associated with more severe to moderate nuclear atypia (100% vs. 36.4%, P = 0.004) and mitotic activity (90.9% vs. 27.3%, P = 0.008) compared with AML tumors. Out of 11 cases of EAML, 8 were positive for p53. There was only 1 case with positive p53 expression in AML cases and expression of p53 protein showed significant difference between EAML and AML tumors (72.7% vs. 9.1%, P = 0.008). In addition, there were 7 AML and 6 EAML cases harbored P72R mutation (SNP) in exon 4 of p53. Compared with AML cases, 2 out of 11 cases of EMAL showed more than 10% positivity for ki-67. The finding of stronger p53 expression in renal EAML might have contributed to their malignant behavior. However, the abnormal p53 expression cannot be entirely explained by p53 mutations in the exons examined.Thus, the combination of immunohistochemical assessment of tumor antigens might improve our ability to predict the malignant outcome in EAML.
25990896	Increased gene dosage of Ink4/Arf and p53 delays age-associated central nervous system functional decline.	Carrasco-Garcia E, Arrizabalaga O, Serrano M, Lovell-Badge R, Matheu A.	The impairment of the activity of the brain is a major feature of aging, which coincides with a decrease in the function of neural stem cells. We have previously shown that an extra copy of regulated Ink4/Arf and p53 activity, in s-Ink4/Arf/p53 mice, elongates lifespan and delays aging. In this work, we examined the physiology of the s-Ink4/Arf/p53 brain with aging, focusing on the neural stem cell (NSC) population. We show that cells derived from old s-Ink4/Arf/p53 mice display enhanced neurosphere formation and self-renewal activity compared with wt controls. This correlates with augmented expression of Sox2, Sox9, Glast, Ascl1, and Ars2 NSC markers in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus (DG) niches. Furthermore, aged s-Ink4/Arf/p53 mice express higher levels of Doublecortin and PSA-NCAM (neuroblasts) and NeuN (neurons) in the olfactory bulbs (OB) and DG, indicating increased neurogenesis in vivo. Finally, aged s-Ink4/Arf/p53 mice present enhanced behavioral and neuromuscular coordination activity. Together, these findings demonstrate that increased but regulated Ink4/Arf and p53 activity ameliorates age-related deterioration of the central nervous system activity required to maintain the stem cell pool, providing a mechanism not only for the extended lifespan but also for the health span of these mice.
25131770	SIRT1 regulates oncogenesis via a mutant p53-dependent pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma.	Zhang ZY, Hong D, Nam SH, Kim JM, Paik YH, Joh JW, Kwon CH, Park JB, Choi GS, Jang KY, Park CK, Kim SJ.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: SIRT1 is a class III histone deacetylase that plays diverse roles in various cancers. However, the clinical significance of SIRT1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. METHODS: We analysed p53 mutations and the activation of SIRT1 in 252 hepatitis B virus-positive HCC cases. None of the patients had been subjected to pre-operative treatment. RESULTS: We examined 57 p53 mutations from 248 HCC tissues. Activated SIRT1 (phosphorylated form of Ser47), in the context of mutant p53, predicted a longer relapse-free survival (RFS) but not a longer overall survival (OS) (RFS: p = 0.007, OS: p = 0.280) in HCC tissues harbouring mutant p53. In multivariate analysis, activated SIRT1 remained a significant predictor of longer RFS (OR = 0.307, CI: 0.143-0.660, p=0.002). Analysis of 248 paired specimens revealed a significant correlation between activated SIRT1 (Ser47) and activated AMPK (Thr172) in HCC tissues harbouring mutant p53 (p = 0.003, n = 57). The combination of these 2 parameters was a powerful predictor for a good prognosis in these patients. In vitro, SIRT1 inactivation stimulated the growth of HCC cells, bearing mutated p53, by suppressing AMPK activity and subsequently enhancing mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity, resulting in induction of p70S6K1 activation in HCC cells. Metformin, an AMPK activator, more strongly suppressed cell growth in p53-mutant cell lines with inactive SIRT1 than in p53-mutant cell lines with active SIRT1. CONCLUSIONS: SIRT1 exerted anti-carcinogenic effects via the AMPK-mTOR pathway in HCC in the context of mutant p53. Metformin could be a therapeutic drug for HCC in patients with mutated p53, inactivated SIRT1, and AMPK expression.
24413081	Regulation of Mdm2 protein stability and the p53 response by NEDD4-1 E3 ligase.	Xu C, Fan CD, Wang X.	Mdm2 is a critical negative regulator of the tumor suppressor protein p53. Mdm2 is an E3 ligase whose overexpression leads to functional inactivation of p53. Mdm2 protein stability is regulated by several mechanisms including RING (Really Interesting New Gene) domain-mediated autoubiquitination. Here we report biochemical identification of NEDD4-1 as an E3 ligase for Mdm2 that contributes to the regulation of Mdm2 protein stability in cells. NEDD4-1 was identified from Jurkat cytosolic fractions using an enzyme-dead Mdm2 mutant protein as a substrate for in vitro E3 ligase assays. We show that lysates from Nedd4-1 knockout (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) have significantly diminished E3 ligase activity toward Mdm2 compared with lysates from wild-type (WT) MEFs. Recombinant NEDD4-1 promotes Mdm2 ubiquitination in vitro in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. In cells, NEDD4-1 physically interacts with Mdm2 via the RING domain of Mdm2. Overexpression of NEDD4-1, but not an enzyme-dead NEDD4-1CS mutant, increases ubiquitination of Mdm2. NEDD4-1 catalyzes the formation of K63-type polyubiquitin chains on Mdm2 that are distinct from K48-type polyubiquitination chains mediated by the Mdm2/MdmX complex. Importantly, K63-type polyubiquitination by NEDD4-1 competes with K48-type polyubiquitination on Mdm2 in cells. As a result, NEDD4-1-mediated ubiquitination stabilizes Mdm2. NEDD4-1 knockdown reduces the t1/2 (half-life) of endogenous Mdm2 from 20 to 12 min in U2OS cells. Nedd4-1 KO MEFs manifest increased p53 levels and activity, a more robust DNA damage response and increased G1 arrest compared with WT MEFs. Similarly, NEDD4-1 knockdown in WT-p53-bearing cells increases basal p53 levels and activity in an Mdm2-dependent manner, causes stronger p53 responses to DNA damage and results in p53-dependent growth inhibition compared with corresponding NEDD4-1-proficient control cells. This study identifies NEDD4-1 as a novel component of the p53/Mdm2 regulatory feedback loop that controls p53 activity during stress responses.
25499080	Mutations of p53 and KRAS activate NF-κB to promote chemoresistance and tumorigenesis via dysregulation of cell cycle and suppression of apoptosis in lung cancer cells.	Yang L, Zhou Y, Li Y, Zhou J, Wu Y, Cui Y, Yang G, Hong Y.	Although mutations of p53 and KRAS and activation of NF-κB signaling have been highly associated with chemoresistance and tumorigenesis of lung cancer, the interactive mechanisms between two of p53, KRAS, and NF-κB are elusive. In the present study, we first observed that blocking of NF-κB function in KRAS mutant A549 cell line with an IκBα mutant (IκBαM) inhibited cell cycle progression, anti-apoptosis, chemoresistance, and tumorigenesis. Silencing of p53 or KRAS in A549 or H358 cells either enhanced or attenuated the resistance of cells to cisplatin and taxol through promotion or suppression of the NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation. Introduction of a wild type p53 into p53 null lung cancer cell lines H1299 and H358 inhibited NF-κB activity, leading to the enhanced response to chemotherapeutic drugs. Delivery of a mutant p53 or KRAS-V12 into A549/IκBαM or H1299/p53Wt cells increased cell cycle progression, anti-apoptosis, chemoresistance, and tumorigenesis due to the accumulated nuclear localization of NF-κB p65, while treatment of H1299/p53Wt/KRAS-V12 with NF-κB inhibitor PS1145 diminished these effects. Thus, we conclude that p53 deficiency and KRAS mutation activate the NF-κB signaling to control chemoresistance and tumorigenesis, and that the status of p53 and KRAS may be considered for the targeted therapy against NF-κB in lung cancer patients.
26469958	p53 regulates the mevalonate pathway in human glioblastoma multiforme.	Laezza C, D'Alessandro A, Di Croce L, Picardi P, Ciaglia E, Pisanti S, Malfitano AM, Comegna M, Faraonio R, Gazzerro P, Bifulco M.	The mevalonate (MVA) pathway is an important metabolic pathway implicated in multiple aspects of tumorigenesis. In this study, we provided evidence that p53 induces the expression of a group of enzymes of the MVA pathway including 3'-hydroxy-3'-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, MVA kinase, farnesyl diphosphate synthase and farnesyl diphosphate farnesyl transferase 1, in the human glioblastoma multiforme cell line, U343 cells, and in normal human astrocytes, NHAs. Genetic and pharmacologic perturbation of p53 directly influences the expression of these genes. Furthermore, p53 is recruited to the gene promoters in designated p53-responsive elements, thereby increasing their transcription. Such effect was abolished by site-directed mutagenesis in the p53-responsive element of promoter of the genes. These findings highlight another aspect of p53 functions unrelated to tumor suppression and suggest p53 as a novel regulator of the MVA pathway providing insight into the role of this pathway in cancer progression.
26059686	Cytotoxic effects of replication-competent adenoviruses on human esophageal carcinoma are enhanced by forced p53 expression.	Yang S, Kawamura K, Okamoto S, Yamauchi S, Shingyoji M, Sekine I, Kobayashi H, Tada Y, Tatsumi K, Hiroshima K, Shimada H, Tagawa M.	BACKGROUND: Improvement of transduction and augmentation of cytotoxicity are crucial for adenoviruses (Ad)-mediated gene therapy for cancer. Down-regulated expression of type 5 Ad (Ad5) receptors on human tumors hampered Ad-mediated transduction. Furthermore, a role of the p53 pathways in cytotoxicity mediated by replication-competent Ad remained uncharacterized. METHODS: We constructed replication-competent Ad5 of which the E1 region genes were activated by a transcriptional regulatory region of the midkine or the survivin gene, which is expressed preferentially in human tumors. We also prepared replication-competent Ad5 which were regulated by the same region but had a fiber-knob region derived from serotype 35 (AdF35). We examined the cytotoxicity of these Ad and a possible combinatory use of the replication-competent AdF35 and Ad5 expressing the wild-type p53 gene (Ad5/p53) in esophageal carcinoma cells. Expression levels of molecules involved in cell death, anti-tumor effects in vivo and production of viral progenies were also investigated. RESULTS: Replication-competent AdF35 in general achieved greater cytotoxic effects to esophageal carcinoma cells than the corresponding replication-competent Ad5. Infection with the AdF35 induced cleavages of caspases and increased sub-G1 fractions, but did not activate the autophagy pathway. Transduction with Ad5/p53 in combination with the replication-competent AdF35 further enhanced the cytotoxicity in a synergistic manner. We also demonstrated the combinatory effects in an animal model. Transduction with Ad5/p53 however suppressed production of replication-competent AdF35 progenies, but the combination augmented Ad5/p53-mediated p53 expression levels and the downstream pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Combination of replication-competent AdF35 and Ad5/p53 achieved synergistic cytotoxicity due to enhanced p53-mediated apoptotic pathways.
26481508	XingNaoJing, prescription of traditional Chinese medicine, prevents autophagy in experimental stroke by repressing p53-DRAM pathway.	Wei G, Huang Y, Li F, Zeng F, Li Y, Deng R, Lai Y, Zhou J, Huang G, Chen D.	Xingnaojing (XNJ), a well known prescription in traditional Chinese medicine, has been used for treatment of stroke in China. However, the effects and mechanisms of XNJ on autophagy are not clear. Here, we used the cell models of autophagy induced by serum-free condition and ischemia stroke in rats to further investigate whether the p53-DRAM pathway is involved in the effects of XNJ on autophagy.We used the cell model of autophagy induced by serum-free condition and the rat model of ischemia caused by a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The effects of XNJ on p53 transcriptional activity of PC12 cells were evaluated by the luciferase activity assay. The mRNA levels and the expression of p53 and its target autophagy gene DRAM (damage-regulated autophagy modulator) were analyzed respectively by Quantitative-RTPCR and Western blot assay. The activation of autophagy was detected by the levels of autophagy markers, microtubule associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) and p62 by Immunofluorescence and Western blot. p53 inhibitor was used to determine whether p53 is responsible for the effects of XNJ on preventing autophagy.The assay for luciferase activity of p53 promoter indicated that XNJ inhibited p53 transcriptional activity. XNJ reduced the expression of p53 and its target autophagy gene DRAM (damage-regulated autophagy modulator) in serum-free condition PC12 cells and the cortex in MCAO rats. XNJ reduced autophagy of PC12 cells induced by serum-free condition and the cortex in MCAO rats. Furthermore, suppression of p53 by p53 inhibitor significantly reduced the effects of XNJ on the autophagy of PC12 cells in serum-free condition.XNJ prevents autophagy in experimental stroke by repressing p53/DRAM pathway. Our findings are therefore of considerable therapeutic significance and provide the novel and potential application of XNJ for the treatment of brain diseases.
26098630	A Novel Protein Interaction between Nucleotide Binding Domain of Hsp70 and p53 Motif.	Elengoe A, Naser MA, Hamdan S.	Currently, protein interaction of Homo sapiens nucleotide binding domain (NBD) of heat shock 70 kDa protein (PDB: 1HJO) with p53 motif remains to be elucidated. The NBD-p53 motif complex enhances the p53 stabilization, thereby increasing the tumor suppression activity in cancer treatment. Therefore, we identified the interaction between NBD and p53 using STRING version 9.1 program. Then, we modeled the three-dimensional structure of p53 motif through homology modeling and determined the binding affinity and stability of NBD-p53 motif complex structure via molecular docking and dynamics (MD) simulation. Human DNA binding domain of p53 motif (SCMGGMNR) retrieved from UniProt (UniProtKB: P04637) was docked with the NBD protein, using the Autodock version 4.2 program. The binding energy and intermolecular energy for the NBD-p53 motif complex were -0.44 Kcal/mol and -9.90 Kcal/mol, respectively. Moreover, RMSD, RMSF, hydrogen bonds, salt bridge, and secondary structure analyses revealed that the NBD protein had a strong bond with p53 motif and the protein-ligand complex was stable. Thus, the current data would be highly encouraging for designing Hsp70 structure based drug in cancer therapy.
25333414	TP53/p53 alterations and Aurora A expression in progressor and non-progressor colectomies from patients with longstanding ulcerative colitis.	Friis-Ottessen M, Burum-Auensen E, Schjølberg AR, Ekstrøm PO, Andersen SN, Clausen OP, De Angelis PM.	Aneuploidy is a common feature in the colonic mucosa of patients suffering from the inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis (UC) and often precedes the development of dysplasia and cancer. Aneuploidy is assumed to be caused by missegregation of chromosomes during mitosis, often due to a faulty spindle assembly checkpoint. p53 is a tumour suppressor protein known to regulate the spindle assembly checkpoint and is frequently mutated in aneuploid cells. Aurora A is a presumed oncoprotein, also involved in regulation of the spindle assembly checkpoint. In the present study, we examined the mutational frequency of TP53 and the protein levels of p53 in a set of 20 progressor and 10 non-progressor colectomies from patients suffering from longstanding UC. In addition, we re-examined previously published immunohistochemical data on Aurora A expression using the same material. Levels of Aurora A were re-examined with regard to DNA ploidy status and dysplasia within the progressors, as well as in relation to p53 accumulation and TP53 mutational status. We detected p53 accumulation only within the progressor colectomies, where it could be followed back 14 years prior to the colectomies, in pre-colectomy biopsies. TP53 mutations were detected in both progressors and non-progressors. Expression levels of Aurora A were similar in the progressors and non-progressors. Within the group of progressors however, low levels of Aurora A were associated with areas of DNA aneuploidy, as well as with increasing degrees of dysplasia. Our results indicate that alterations in p53 may be an early biomarker of a progressor colon, and that p53 is accumulated early in UC-related carcinogenesis. Furthermore, a decreased Aurora A expression is associated with the development of DNA aneuploidy, as well as with dysplasia in UC progressors.
25301067	Caspase-2 impacts lung tumorigenesis and chemotherapy response in vivo.	Terry MR, Arya R, Mukhopadhyay A, Berrett KC, Clair PM, Witt B, Salama ME, Bhutkar A, Oliver TG.	Caspase-2 is an atypical caspase that regulates apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and genome maintenance, although the mechanisms are not well understood. Caspase-2 has also been implicated in chemotherapy response in lung cancer, but this function has not been addressed in vivo. Here we show that Caspase-2 functions as a tumor suppressor in Kras-driven lung cancer in vivo. Loss of Caspase-2 leads to enhanced tumor proliferation and progression. Despite being more histologically advanced, Caspase-2-deficient tumors are sensitive to chemotherapy and exhibit a significant reduction in tumor volume following repeated treatment. However, Caspase-2-deficient tumors rapidly rebound from chemotherapy with enhanced proliferation, ultimately hindering long-term therapeutic benefit. In response to DNA damage, Caspase-2 cleaves and inhibits Mdm2 and thereby promotes the stability of the tumor-suppressor p53. Caspase-2 expression levels are significantly reduced in human lung tumors with wild-type p53, in agreement with the model whereby Caspase-2 functions through Mdm2/p53 regulation. Consistently, p53 target genes including p21, cyclin G1 and Msh2 are reduced in Caspase-2-deficient tumors. Finally, we show that phosphorylation of p53-induced protein with a death domain 1 leads to Caspase-2-mediated cleavage of Mdm2, directly impacting p53 levels, activity and chemotherapy response. Together, these studies elucidate a Caspase-2-p53 signaling network that impacts lung tumorigenesis and chemotherapy response in vivo.
26244575	Structure and Function of p53-DNA Complexes with Inactivation and Rescue Mutations: A Molecular Dynamics Simulation Study.	Kamaraj B, Bogaerts A.	The tumor suppressor protein p53 can lose its function upon DNA-contact mutations (R273C and R273H) in the core DNA-binding domain. The activity can be restored by second-site suppressor or rescue mutations (R273C_T284R, R273H_T284R, and R273H_S240R). In this paper, we elucidate the structural and functional consequence of p53 proteins upon DNA-contact mutations and rescue mutations and the underlying mechanisms at the atomic level by means of molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, we also apply the docking approach to investigate the binding phenomena between the p53 protein and DNA upon DNA-contact mutations and rescue mutations. This study clearly illustrates that, due to DNA-contact mutants, the p53 structure loses its stability and becomes more rigid than the native protein. This structural loss might affect the p53-DNA interaction and leads to inhibition of the cancer suppression. Rescue mutants (R273C_T284R, R273H_T284R and R273H_S240R) can restore the functional activity of the p53 protein upon DNA-contact mutations and show a good interaction between the p53 protein and a DNA molecule, which may lead to reactivate the cancer suppression function. Understanding the effects of p53 cancer and rescue mutations at the molecular level will be helpful for designing drugs for p53 associated cancer diseases. These drugs should be designed so that they can help to inhibit the abnormal function of the p53 protein and to reactivate the p53 function (cell apoptosis) to treat human cancer.
25080447	Bacterial CagA protein induces degradation of p53 protein in a p14ARF-dependent manner.	Wei J, Noto JM, Zaika E, Romero-Gallo J, Piazuelo MB, Schneider B, El-Rifai W, Correa P, Peek RM, Zaika AI.	OBJECTIVE: Infection with Helicobacter pylori is the strongest known risk factor for adenocarcinoma of the stomach. Tumorigenic transformation of gastric epithelium induced by H. pylori is a highly complex process driven by an active interplay between bacterial virulence and host factors, many aspects of which remain obscure. In this work, we investigated the degradation of p53 tumour suppressor induced by H. pylori. DESIGN: Expression of p53 protein in gastric biopsies was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Gastric cells were co-cultured with H. pylori strains isolated from high-gastric risk and low-gastric risk areas and assessed for expression of p53, p14ARF and cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) by immunoblotting. siRNA was used to inhibit activities of ARF-BP1 and Human Double Minute 2 (HDM2) proteins. RESULTS: Our analysis demonstrated that H. pylori strains expressing high levels of CagA virulence factor and associated with a higher gastric cancer risk more strongly suppress p53 compared with low-risk strains in vivo and in vitro. We found that degradation of p53 induced by bacterial CagA protein is mediated by host HDM2 and ARF-BP1 E3 ubiquitin ligases, while the p14ARF protein counteracts H. pylori-induced signalling. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide novel evidence that tumorigenicity associated with H. pylori infection is linked to inhibition of p53 protein by CagA. We propose a model in which CagA-induced degradation of p53 protein is determined by a relative level of p14ARF. In cells in which p14ARF levels were decreased due to hypermethylation or deletion of the p14ARF gene, H. pylori efficiently degraded p53, whereas p53 is protected in cells expressing high levels of p14ARF.
26119234	Aspp1 Preserves Hematopoietic Stem Cell Pool Integrity and Prevents Malignant Transformation.	Yamashita M, Nitta E, Suda T.	Quiescent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are prone to mutagenesis, and accumulation of mutations can result in hematological malignancies. The mechanisms through which HSCs prevent such detrimental accumulation, however, are unclear. Here, we show that Aspp1 coordinates with p53 to maintain the genomic integrity of the HSC pool. Aspp1 is preferentially expressed in HSCs and restricts HSC pool size by attenuating self-renewal under steady-state conditions. After genotoxic stress, Aspp1 promotes HSC cycling and induces p53-dependent apoptosis in cells with persistent DNA damage foci. Beyond these p53-dependent functions, Aspp1 attenuates HSC self-renewal and accumulation of DNA damage in p53 null HSCs. Consequently, concomitant loss of Aspp1 and p53 leads to the development of hematological malignancies, especially T cell leukemia and lymphoma. Together, these data highlight coordination between Aspp1 and p53 in regulating HSC self-renewal and DNA damage tolerance and suggest that HSCs possess specific mechanisms that prevent accumulation of mutations and malignant transformation.
26200835	Rational Manual and Automated Scoring Thresholds for the Immunohistochemical Detection of TP53 Missense Mutations in Human Breast Carcinomas.	Taylor NJ, Nikolaishvili-Feinberg N, Midkiff BR, Conway K, Millikan RC, Geradts J.	Missense mutations in TP53 are common in human breast cancer, have been associated with worse prognosis, and may predict therapy effect. TP53 missense mutations are associated with aberrant accumulation of p53 protein in tumor cell nuclei. Previous studies have used relatively arbitrary cutoffs to characterize breast tumors as positive for p53 staining by immunohistochemical assays. This study aimed to objectively determine optimal thresholds for p53 positivity by manual and automated scoring methods using whole tissue sections from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study. p53-immunostained slides were available for 564 breast tumors previously assayed for TP53 mutations. Average nuclear p53 staining intensity was manually scored as negative, borderline, weak, moderate, or strong and percentage of positive tumor cells was estimated. Automated p53 signal intensity was measured using the Aperio nuclear v9 algorithm combined with the Genie histology pattern recognition tool and tuned to achieve optimal nuclear segmentation. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to determine optimal cutoffs for average staining intensity and percent cells positive to distinguish between tumors with and without a missense mutation. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated a threshold of moderate average nuclear staining intensity as a good surrogate for TP53 missense mutations in both manual (area under the curve=0.87) and automated (area under the curve=0.84) scoring systems. Both manual and automated immunohistochemical scoring methods predicted missense mutations in breast carcinomas with high accuracy. Validation of the automated intensity scoring threshold suggests a role for such algorithms in detecting TP53 missense mutations in high throughput studies.
26259780	Increased ID4 expression, accompanied by mutant p53 accumulation and loss of BRCA1/2 proteins in triple negative breast cancer adversely affects survival.	Thike AA, Puay Hoon T, Ikeda M, Iqbal J.	INTRODUCTION: BRCA1 expression is down-regulated in a significant proportion of nonhereditary breast cancers, in absence of any mutation. This phenomenon is more pronounced in ER-negative tumors. Recent studies have suggested that inhibitor of DNA binding (ID)-4 as well as p53 participate in the transcriptional regulation of BRCA1. METHODS: Immunohistochemical expression of ID4, BRCA1, BRCA2 and p53 in 699 women with triple negative breast cancer was investigated using tissue microarrays. Prognostic role of these biomarkers were also evaluated. Survival outcomes were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between groups with log-rank statistics. RESULTS: loss of BRCA1 and BRCA2 expression and overexpression of ID4 and p53 was observed in 75%, 90.0%, 95% and 66% of tumors respectively. ID4 expression was increased in higher tumor grade (p<0.001) and was significantly associated with basal-like subtype (p<0.001), BRCA2 downregulation (p=0.037) and p53 accumulation (p<0.001). Patients with strong ID4 expression displayed worse disease-free survival in both triple negative breast cancers (p=0.041) and basal-like triple negative breast cancers (p=0.026). CONCLUSION: There is frequent ID4 expression and concomitant loss of BRCA proteins in triple negative breast cancer. We hypothesize that strong ID4 expression could be useful as a prognostic marker in triple negative breast cancer, predicting early tumor recurrence. This article is protected by copyright.

26375870	Dynamics of p53 and Wnt cross talk.	Zubbair Malik M, Ali S, Jahoor Alam M, Ishrat R, Brojen Singh RK.	We present the mechanism of interaction of Wnt network module, which is responsible for periodic somitogenesis, with p53 regulatory network, which is one of the main regulators of various cellular functions, and switching of various oscillating states by investigating p53-Wnt model. The variation in Nutlin concentration in p53 regulating network drives the Wnt network module to different states, stabilized, damped and sustain oscillation states, and even to cycle arrest. Similarly, the change in Axin2 concentration in Wnt could able to modulate the p53 dynamics at these states. We then solve the set of coupled ordinary differential equations of the model using quasi steady state approximation. We, further, demonstrate the change of p53 and GSK3 interaction rate, due to hypothetical catalytic reaction or external stimuli, can able to regulate the dynamics of the two network modules, and even can control their dynamics to protect the system from cycle arrest (apoptosis).
24831244	Expression of HPV-16 E6 protein and p53 inactivation increases the uterine cervical cancer invasion.	Yang X, Lu L.	INTRODUCTION: Human papillomavirus infection (HPV-16) and expression of HPV E6 protein are the major risk factors of cervical cancer. Studies reported that expression of E6 protein adversely affect the function of p53 and thus involved in tumor progression. In the present study, we made an attempt to analyze the prevalence of HPV-16 association, E6 and p53 expression in cervical cancer tissues. METHODS: Uterine cervical cancer (n=10) and corresponding normal epithelium tissues (n=10) were collected at the time of surgery. The HPV-16 integration and E6 expression were analyzed by PCR and immunohistostaining. Further, p53 and Ki67 expression were analyzed by immunohistostaining. Telomerase was detected using a modified TRAP (telomerase repeat amplification protocol) assay. RESULTS: We have found that almost 90% of the collected cervical cancer DNA samples showed positivity to HPV-16 and more than 60% of DNA samples were E6 positive. Further, these tissues were highly positive to p53 and Ki67 protein which contribute to apoptosis resistance and increased cell proliferation. We also found elevated level of telomerase expression in cancer tissues compared to control. CONCLUSIONS: The association of HPV infection and E6 expression increases the risk of cervical cancer. Further, E6 expression is the cause for inactivation of p53 in tumor tissues and deregulated cell proliferation and thus favors for tumor invasion.
25040820	Revisiting TP53 Mutations and Immunohistochemistry--A Comparative Study in 157 Diffuse Gliomas.	Takami H, Yoshida A, Fukushima S, Arita H, Matsushita Y, Nakamura T, Ohno M, Miyakita Y, Shibui S, Narita Y, Ichimura K.	The association between p53 immunohistochemistry and TP53 mutation status has been controversial. The present study aims to re-evaluate the efficacy of p53 immunohistochemistry to predict the mutational status of TP53. A total of 157 diffuse gliomas (World Health Organization grades II-IV) were assessed by exon-by-exon DNA sequencing from exon 4 through 10 of TP53 using frozen tissue samples. Immunohistochemistry with a p53 antibody (DO-7) on paired formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded materials was assessed for the extent and intensity of reactivity in all cases. A total of 72 mutations were detected in 66 samples. They included 60 missense mutations, five nonsense mutations, four deletions and three alterations in the splicing sites. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that strong p53 immunoreactivity in more than 10% of cells provided the most accurate prediction of mutation. Using this cutoff value, 52 of 55 immunopositive cases harbored a mutation, whereas only 14 of 102 immunonegative cases showed mutations, sensitivity and specificity being 78.8% and 96.7%. Tumors with frameshift mutations frequently showed negative immunostaining. Staining interpretation by an independent observer yielded comparable accuracy. We thus propose p53 immunohistochemistry as a moderately sensitive and highly specific marker to predict TP53 mutation.
25794615	The p53 C terminus controls site-specific DNA binding and promotes structural changes within the central DNA binding domain.	Laptenko O, Shiff I, Freed-Pastor W, Zupnick A, Mattia M, Freulich E, Shamir I, Kadouri N, Kahan T, Manfredi J, Simon I, Prives C.	DNA binding by numerous transcription factors including the p53 tumor suppressor protein constitutes a vital early step in transcriptional activation. While the role of the central core DNA binding domain (DBD) of p53 in site-specific DNA binding has been established, the contribution of the sequence-independent C-terminal domain (CTD) is still not well understood. We investigated the DNA-binding properties of a series of p53 CTD variants using a combination of in vitro biochemical analyses and in vivo binding experiments. Our results provide several unanticipated and interconnected findings. First, the CTD enables DNA binding in a sequence-dependent manner that is drastically altered by either its modification or deletion. Second, dependence on the CTD correlates with the extent to which the p53 binding site deviates from the canonical consensus sequence. Third, the CTD enables stable formation of p53-DNA complexes to divergent binding sites via DNA-induced conformational changes within the DBD itself.
25896587	The p53/miR-34a/SIRT1 Positive Feedback Loop in Quercetin-Induced Apoptosis.	Lou G, Liu Y, Wu S, Xue J, Yang F, Fu H, Zheng M, Chen Z.	BACKGROUND: The anti-tumor effects of quercetin have been reported, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. The aim of present study was to explore the role of miRNA in the anticancer effects of quercetin. METHODS: The differential miRNAs expression between the HepG2 and Huh7 cells treated by quercetin were detected by microarray. The xCELLigence, Flow cytometry, RT-PCR and Western blot were used to analyze the cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, anti-tumor genes, and protein expression. RESULTS: miR-34a was up-regulated in HepG2 cells treated by quercetin exhibiting wild-type p53. When inhibiting the miR-34a, the sensitivity of the cells to quercetin decreased and the expression of the SIRT1 was up-regulated, but the acetylation of p53 and the expression of some genes related to p53 down-regulated. CONCLUSION: miR-34a plays an important role in the anti-tumor effects of querctin in HCC, miR-34a may be a tiemolecule between the p53 and SIRT1 and is composed of a p53/miR-34a/SIRT1 signal feedback loop, which could enhance apoptosis signal and significantly promote cell apoptosis.
25950388	Immunohistochemical profiles of IDH1, MGMT and P53: practical significance for prognostication of patients with diffuse gliomas.	Ogura R, Tsukamoto Y, Natsumeda M, Isogawa M, Aoki H, Kobayashi T, Yoshida S, Okamoto K, Takahashi H, Fujii Y, Kakita A.	Genetic and epigenetic status, including mutations of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and TP53 and methylation of O(6) -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), are associated with the development of various types of glioma and are useful for prognostication. Here, using routinely available histology sections from 312 patients with diffuse gliomas, we performed immunohistochemistry using antibodies specific for IDH1 mutation, MGMT methylation status, and aberrant p53 expression to evaluate the possible prognostic significance of these features. With regard to overall survival (OS), univariate analysis indicated that an IDH1-positive profile in patients with glioblastoma (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), anaplastic oligoastrocytoma and oligodendroglioma, or a MGMT-negative profile in patients with GBM and AA were significantly associated with a favorable outcome. Multivariate analysis revealed that both profiles were independent factors influencing prognosis. The OS of patients with IDH1-positive/MGMT-negative profiles was significantly longer than that of patients with negative/negative and negative/positive profiles. A p53 profile was not an independent prognostic factor. However, for GBM/AA patients with IDH1-negative/MGMT-negative profiles, p53 overexpression was significantly associated with an unfavorable outcome. Thus, the immunohistochemical profiles of IDH1 and MGMT are of considerable significance in gliomas, and a combination of IDH1, MGMT and p53 profiles may be useful for prognostication of GBM/AA.
26028067	Hesa-A Improves Clinical Outcome of Oral Carcinoma by Affecting p53 Gene Expression in vivo.	Abbasi MM, Helli S, Monfaredan A, Jahanban-Esfahlan R.	BACKGROUND: Oral carcinoma (OC) remains as one of the most difficult malignancies to cure. Hesa-A is an Iranian herbal-marine compound that has shown promising anti-tumor properties on various human cancer cells, although the mechanisms of action remain to be addressed. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of two doses of Hesa-A on mRNA expression of p53 as a main prognosticator of OC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 60 rats were randomly divided into 5 groups of 12 animals each. Rats in carcinoma groups received 0, 250 and 500 mg/kg body weight of Hesa-A three times a day. The two other groups considered as treated and untreated healthy groups. At the end of experiment, animals were sacrificed and tongue tissues subjected to H and E staining and real time PCR. RESULTS: Our results indicated that compared to healthy group, p53 over expressed ~ 40% in untreated carcinoma group. After treatment with 250 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg body weights of Hesa-A , p53 level dropped by 53.4% and 13.6 %, respectively, compared to untreated carcinoma group (p<0.05, p<0.0001). Moreover, there was a significant relation between p53 mRNA content and observed pathological changes in studied groups (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data provide insights into the mechanism(s) by which Hesa-A improves clinical outcome of oral carcinoma by modulation of p53 expression.
25398693	Knockdown of PSF1 expression inhibits cell proliferation in lung cancer cells in vitro.	Zhang J, Wu Q, Wang Z, Zhang Y, Zhang G, Fu J, Liu C.	Partner of sld five 1 (PSF1) is a member of the heterotetrameric complex termed GINS. Previous studies have shown that PSF1 is unregulated in several cancer and associated with tumor malignant characters. However, the effects of PSF1 in lung cancer are still unclear. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of PSF1 on the proliferation capacities of lung cancer. To start with, expression of PSF1 in 22 human lung cancer samples and adjacent non-tumor samples were detected by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting. Our results showed that PSF1 was overexpressed in lung cancer samples compared to adjacent non-tumor samples. To achieve better insights of PSF1 functions in lung cancer cells, we used PSF1-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) successfully inhibit the expression of PSF1 in messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. In addition, we used lung cancer cell lines with different p53 gene background (p53 null and p53 wild-type). The results showed that knockdown of PSF1 inhibited cell proliferation and caused cell cycle arrest of lung cancer cells in a p53-independent manner. Our data indicated that PSF1 is functionally involved in lung cancer cell proliferation and is a potential target for lung cancer therapy.
25434397	Deoxycholic acid inhibits the growth of BGC-823 gastric carcinoma cells via a p53‑mediated pathway.	Yang HB, Song W, Cheng MD, Fan HF, Gu X, Qiao Y, Lu X, Yu RH, Chen LY.	The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of deoxycholic acid (DCA) on BGC‑823 human gastric carcinoma cells and to explore the possible mechanisms underlying any such effects. Cell proliferation was detected using a 3‑(4,5‑Dimethylthiazol‑2‑yl)‑2,5‑diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay, cell morphology was observed by inverted microscopy, and cell cycle progression and the mitochondrial membrane potential were analyzed using flow cytometry. The expression of Bcl‑2, Bax, p53, Cyclin D1 and cyclin‑dependent kinase (CDK)2 proteins in BGC‑823 cells was analyzed with western blotting. The results demonstrated that DCA significantly inhibited cell growth, and that the cell cycle was arrested at the G1 phase. DCA was also shown to induce BGC‑823 cell apoptosis, which was associated with the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential. The mitochondria‑dependent pathway was activated via an increase in the ratio of Bax:Bcl‑2 in BGC‑823 cells. In addition, the expression of p53, cyclin D1 and CDK2 was altered following DCA treatment. These results suggest that DCA induces apoptosis in gastric carcinoma cells through activation of an intrinsic mitochondrial‑dependent pathway, in which p53 is involved.
25501595	p53 suppresses muscle differentiation at the myogenin step in response to genotoxic stress.	Yang ZJ, Broz DK, Noderer WL, Ferreira JP, Overton KW, Spencer SL, Meyer T, Tapscott SJ, Attardi LD, Wang CL.	Acute muscle injury and physiological stress from chronic muscle diseases and aging lead to impairment of skeletal muscle function. This raises the question of whether p53, a cellular stress sensor, regulates muscle tissue repair under stress conditions. By investigating muscle differentiation in the presence of genotoxic stress, we discovered that p53 binds directly to the myogenin promoter and represses transcription of myogenin, a member of the MyoD family of transcription factors that plays a critical role in driving terminal muscle differentiation. This reduction of myogenin protein is observed in G1-arrested cells and leads to decreased expression of late but not early differentiation markers. In response to acute genotoxic stress, p53-mediated repression of myogenin reduces post-mitotic nuclear abnormalities in terminally differentiated cells. This study reveals a mechanistic link previously unknown between p53 and muscle differentiation, and suggests new avenues for managing p53-mediated stress responses in chronic muscle diseases or during muscle aging.
25603347	Activation of p53 with ilimaquinone and ethylsmenoquinone, marine sponge metabolites, induces apoptosis and autophagy in colon cancer cells.	Lee HY, Chung KJ, Hwang IH, Gwak J, Park S, Ju BG, Yun E, Kim DE, Chung YH, Na M, Song GY, Oh S.	The tumor suppressor, p53, plays an essential role in the cellular response to stress through regulating the expression of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and autophagy. Here, we used a cell-based reporter system for the detection of p53 response transcription to identify the marine sponge metabolites, ilimaquinone and ethylsmenoquinone, as activators of the p53 pathway. We demonstrated that ilimaquinone and ethylsmenoquinone efficiently stabilize the p53 protein through promotion of p53 phosphorylation at Ser15 in both HCT116 and RKO colon cancer cells. Moreover, both compounds upregulate the expression of p21WAF1/CIP1, a p53-dependent gene, and suppress proliferation of colon cancer cells. In addition, ilimaquinone and ethylsmenoquinone induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and increased caspase-3 cleavage and the population of cells that positively stained with Annexin V-FITC, both of which are typical biochemical markers of apoptosis. Furthermore, autophagy was elicited by both compounds, as indicated by microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) puncta formations and LC3-II turnover in HCT116 cells. Our findings suggest that ilimaquinone and ethylsmenoquinone exert their anti-cancer activity by activation of the p53 pathway and may have significant potential as chemo-preventive and therapeutic agents for human colon cancer.
25732822	Perturbation of ribosome biogenesis drives cells into senescence through 5S RNP-mediated p53 activation.	Nishimura K, Kumazawa T, Kuroda T, Katagiri N, Tsuchiya M, Goto N, Furumai R, Murayama A, Yanagisawa J, Kimura K.	The 5S ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP) complex, consisting of RPL11, RPL5, and 5S rRNA, is implicated in p53 regulation under ribotoxic stress. Here, we show that the 5S RNP contributes to p53 activation and promotes cellular senescence in response to oncogenic or replicative stress. Oncogenic stress accelerates rRNA transcription and replicative stress delays rRNA processing, resulting in RPL11 and RPL5 accumulation in the ribosome-free fraction, where they bind MDM2. Experimental upregulation of rRNA transcription or downregulation of rRNA processing, mimicking the nucleolus under oncogenic or replicative stress, respectively, also induces RPL11-mediated p53 activation and cellular senescence. We demonstrate that exogenous expression of certain rRNA-processing factors rescues the processing defect, attenuates p53 accumulation, and increases replicative lifespan. To summarize, the nucleolar-5S RNP-p53 pathway functions as a senescence inducer in response to oncogenic and replicative stresses.
25773801	P53 polymorphism at codon 72 is associated with keratocystic odontogenic tumors in the Thai population.	Yanatatsaneejit P, Boonsrang A, Mutirangura A, Patel V, Kitkumthorn N.	OBJECTIVE: To clarify the association between the p53 polymorphism at codon 72 and susceptibility to the sporadic keratocystic odontogenic tumor (KCOT). DESIGN: One hundred KCOTs and 160 match-group healthy controls were genotyped to ascertain the frequency of the p53 codon 72 polymorphism using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), confirmed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: The frequencies of the Pro/Pro, Arg/Pro, and Arg/Arg genotypes were 23.8%, 49.4%, and 26.9%, respectively, in the controls, while the KCOT cohort demonstrated 43.0%, 39.0%, and 18.0%, respectively. Further analysis suggested that p53 Pro could be a KCOT-susceptible allele (OR (95%CI)=1.77 (1.22 to 2.59), p=0.0024), with a sex-adjusted OR (95%CI) of 1.71 (1.17-2.50), p=0.0046. Moreover, the results indicated that p53 codon 72 Pro homozygous was associated with a two-fold risk of developing KCOT (adjusted OR (95%CI) =2.17(1.23-3.84), p=0.0062). CONCLUSIONS: The C/C genotype of P53 gene codon 72 increases the risk of developing sporadic KCOT and may be a useful tool for screening and diagnostic purposes.
26400731	Formaldehyde-induced paxillin-tyrosine phosphorylation and paxillin and P53 downexpression in Hela cells.	Zhao Y, Wei C, Wu Y, Ma P, Ding S, Yuan J, Shen D, Yang X.	Formaldehyde (FA) is an environmental pollutant and an endogenous product believed to be involved in tumorigenesis. However, the underlying mechanism of observed FA effects has not been clearly defined. Paxillin is a focal adhesion protein that may play an important role in several signaling pathways. Many paxillin-interacting proteins are involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization, which is necessary for cell motility events associated with diverse biological responses, such as embryonic development, wound repair and tumor metastasis. P53 is important in multicellular organisms, where it regulates the cell cycle and thus functions as a tumor suppressor that is involved in preventing cancer. In this study, we investigated the effects of FA on paxillin-tyrosine phosphorylation and P53 expression in Hela cells by Western blot and immunofluorescence. Western blot analysis revealed that nonlethal concentrations of FA (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mM, with the exposure time for 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 h, respectively) had downregulated paxillin and wild-type p53 genes expression while upregulated paxillin-tyrosine phosphorylation significantly. At the same time, phosphotyrosine at the focal adhesion sites detected by immunofluorescence assay obviously increased in Hela cells incubated with 2.0 mM FA for 2 h. The results suggested that paxillin and p53 genes expression may be involved in FA-related adverse effects and the mechanism may be involved in paxillin-tyrosine phosphorylation.
25586269	SIAH1-induced p34SEI-1 polyubiquitination/degradation mediates p53 preferential vitamin C cytotoxicity.	Lee S, Kim J, Jung S, Li C, Yang Y, Kim KI, Lim JS, Kim Y, Cheon CI, Lee MS.	Vitamin C is considered as an important anticancer therapeutic agent although this view is debatable. In this study, we introduce a physiological mechanism demonstrating how vitamin C exerts anticancer activity that induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Our previous and current data reveal that p53 tumor suppressor is the prerequisite factor for stronger anticancer effects of vitamin C. In addition, vitamin C-mediated cancer cell cytotoxicity appears to be achieved at least partly through the downregulation of the p34SEI-1 oncoprotein. Our previous study showed that p34SEI-1 increases the survival of various types of cancer cells by inhibiting their apoptosis. Present data suggest that vitamin C treatment decreases the p34SEI-1 expression at the protein level and therefore alleviates its anti-apoptotic activity. Of note, SIAH1, E3 ubiquitin ligase, appears to be responsible for the p34SEI-1 polyubiquitination and its subsequent degradation, which is dependent on p53. In summary, vitamin C increases cancer cell death by inducing SIAH1-mediated polyubiquitination/degradation of the p34SEI-1 oncoprotein in a p53-dependent manner.
26374530	P63 in health and cancer.	Gonfloni S, Caputo V, Iannizzotto V.	TP63 is the most ancient member of the p53 gene family. The p53 family comprises three transcription factors (p53/p63/p73). They share a high degree of homology and similar domain structure. Yet, they can exist as truncated isoforms. Alternative promoters and splicing sites lead to the generation of several molecules. P53/p63/p73 are important to maintain cell homeostasis. P63 and p73 regulate many p53 target genes. This is due to their common structural features. Both proteins may compensate the loss of p53. This is a common event occurring in more than 50% of malignancies. Yet, p63 (or p73) has its own role. Studies from p63-null mice have shown the key role of p63 in embryo development. Several reports have supported the p63 role in epidermal development and in skin homeostasis. P63 involvement in heart development is currently being researched. Recent studies have found p63 to be "the guardian of human reproduction". In addition, p63 has an important, even controversial, role in cancer. Here, we provide a general overview of p63 regulation and activity. We discuss emerging concepts about its role in germ line protection, metabolism and cancer.
26446458	Decreased expression of p27 is associated with malignant transformation and extrathyroidal extension in papillary thyroid carcinoma.	Do SI, Kim DH, Yang JH, Pyo JS, Kim K, Lee H, Do IG, Kim DH, Chae SW, Sohn JH.	Cell cycle regulatory proteins including p16, p27, and p53 are well studied in various cancers. However, their single or concurrent roles related with the clinicopathological parameters are not clearly recognized. We analyzed the expression of p16, p27, and p53 cell cycle regulatory proteins in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). To determine the prognostic significance of cell cycle regulatory proteins, 107 PTCs were examined. We analyzed the individual expression of p16, p27, and p53 and their concurrent expressions, with the relationship to various clinicopathological parameters including differentiation from benign lesions. High expression of p16 and p53 and low expression of p27 were related with the distinguishing of PTC from benign lesions. In addition, normal thyroidal tissue showed higher p27 expression than nodular hyperplasia. In relation to extrathyroidal extension (ETE), the low expression of p27 was related with the presence of ETE. The low expression of p27 and high expression of p16 and p53 may affect the development of PTC. In addition, low p27 expression is related with the existence of ETE.
25777161	Influenza virus aggravates the ox-LDL-induced apoptosis of human endothelial cells via promoting p53 signaling.	Suo J, Zhao L, Wang J, Zhu Z, Zhang H, Gao R.	Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) is well recognized to play a key role in the development of atherosclerosis. And influenza virus infection has been also recognized to promote the atherosclerosis onset and progressing. However, little is known about the mechanism into it. In present study, we investigated the infection of A/Porto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) (PR8) influenza virus in human endothelial Eahy926 cells, and determined the induction of apoptosis by the virus infection in the cell. Then we investigated the apoptosis induced by ox-LDL in Eahy926 cells, determined the influence of influenza virus infection on the ox-LDL-induced apoptosis in Eahy926 cells. Results demonstrated that PR8 virus infected human endothelial Eahy926 cells, forming plaques and replicated efficiently in the cell. And the virus infection promoted apoptosis in the cell, upregulated cytchrome c release, activated caspase 3. And what's more, we found that combined PR8 virus infection and ox-LDL treatment promoted higher level of apoptosis and higher level of the activation of apoptosis-associated molecules. Further examination indicated that the p53 signaling was more significantly promoted by both treatments. Therefore, present study confirmed that influenza virus aggravated the ox-LDL-induced apoptosis of human endothelial Eahy926 cells via promoting p53 signaling.
26099444	Association between p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and recurrent pregnancy loss: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis.	Chen H, Yang X, Wang Z.	The p53 tumour suppressor gene plays an important role in angiogenesis and apoptosis. The association between Arg72Pro polymorphism and recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) has been studied but with inconsistent results. A meta-analysis was conducted to examine whether p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism is a risk factor for RPL. Electronic searches of PubMed, Embase and Web of Knowledge were conducted to identify relevant studies. The final meta-analysis included six published articles with 730 RPL cases and 613 controls. The pooled results suggested that the variant genotype was associated with the RPL risk in additive model (Pro versus Arg; odds ratio [OR] = 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06 to 1.54) and recessive model (Pro/Pro versus Arg/Pro + Arg/Arg; OR = 1.82; 95% CI: 1.21 to 2.73). In the stratified analysis by ethnicity, for white people the results were consistent. The Egger's regression asymmetry test suggested a lack of publication bias. Results of this meta-analysis suggest that p53 codon 72 polymorphism is associated with RPL, especially in white people. Identification of p53 codon 72 mutation would have some implication for primary prevention of RPL and screening of high-risk individuals. Large well-designed studies are needed to fully describe the association between this polymorphism and RPL.
26034977	Matrine-induced autophagy regulated by p53 through AMP-activated protein kinase in human hepatoma cells.	Xie SB, He XX, Yao SK.	Matrine, one of the main extract components of Sophora flavescens, has been shown to exhibit inhibitory effects on some tumors through autophagy. However, the mechanism underlying the effect of matrine remains unclear. The cultured human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 and SMMC‑7721 were treated with matrine. Signal transduction and gene expression profile were determined. Matrine stimulated autophagy in SMMC‑7721 cells in a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent manner, but in an mTOR-independent manner in HepG2 cells. Next, in HepG2 cells, autophagy induced by matrine was regulated by p53 inactivation through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling transduction, then AMPK suppression switched autophagy to apoptosis. Furthermore, the interferon (IFN)-inducible genes, including interferon α-inducible protein 27 (IFI27) and interferon induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1), which are downstream effector of p53, might be modulated by matrine-induced autophagy. In addition, we found that the p53 protein isoforms, p53β, p53γ, ∆133p53, and ∆133p53γ, due to alternative splicing of intron 9, might be regulated by the p53-mediated autophagy. These results show that matrine induces autophagy in human hepatoma cells through a novel mechanism, which is p53/AMPK signaling pathway involvement in matrine-promoted autophagy.
24801268	Loss of heterozygosity in mammary serine protease inhibitor (maspin) and p53 at chromosome 17 and 18 in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma.	Choi KY, Choi HJ, Chung EJ, Lee DJ, Kim JH, Rho YS.	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in chromosomes 17p13 (p53 gene) and in 18q21 (mammary serine protease inhibitor [maspin] gene), and the expression of both genes in tissues, in patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). METHODS: Thirty patients with oral cavity SCC have been evaluated for the presence of LOH in chromosomes 17p13 and 18q21, and the expression of p53 and maspin in tissues. Clinicopathological features and survival in these patients were also analyzed. RESULTS: LOH in 17p13 was more frequently identified in patients with lymph node metastasis and/or high TNM classification. LOH in 18q21 was more frequently identified in high primary T classification patients. Increased expression rate of p53 and/or decreased maspin expression rate were significantly higher in oral cavity SCC than normal tissues. CONCLUSION: LOH on chromosome 17, 18, the expression of p53, and maspin are related to the carcinogenesis of oral cavity SCC. Relationships with clinicopathological factors in oral cavity SCC were also revealed. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 37: 1239-1245, 2015.
26202812	Effect of Folic Acid Supplementation on Renal Phenotype and Epigenotype in Early Weanling Intrauterine Growth Retarded Rats.	He X, Xie Z, Dong Q, Li J, Li W, Chen P.	The objective of this study was to examine the responses of p53 promoter methylation involved in kidney structure and function of early weaning intrauterine growth retarded (IUGR) rats to dietary folic acid supplementation.Sprague-Dawley rats were fed isocaloric diets containing either 21% protein diet (normal feed) or 10% protein diet throughout pregnancy and normal feed during lactation. After weaning, Offspring were then fed onto normal feed and normal feed supplemented with 5 mg folic acid / kg feed for a month, this produced 4 dietary groups (maternal diet/ weanling diet): Con, Folic, IUGR and IUGR+Folic. Renal function, renal structure, p53 promoter methylation and protein expression of offspring rats were measured at postnatal 2 months and 3 months.Glomerular volume, blood urea nitrogen, 24 hours urine protein were significantly elevated in IUGR rats compared with Con rats but were decreased by dietary folic acid supplementation. p53 protein expression in IUGR rats were significantly higher than that in Con rats, and p53 promoter methylation status in IUGR rats was reduced significantly compared with Con rats. However, the changes in p53 gene expression and DNA methylation status of IUGR rats were reversed by dietary folic acid supplementation.Our study showed for the first time that folic acid supplementation during early period of life could reverse the abnormality in renal p53 methylation status and protein expression, glomerular volume and renal function of IUGR rats offspring.
26431874	KDM3A interacted with p53K372me1 and regulated p53 binding to PUMA in gastric cancer.	Li W, Lin S, Li W, Wang W, Li X, Xu D.	Chemoresistance remains a major problem in the treatment of gastric cancer patients, leading to the serious limitation of efficacy of chemotherapeutic regime. However, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. In our present study, we for the first time found that knock down of KDM3A can promote apoptosis induced by chemoreagent Cisplatin and Paclitaxel through p53. Mechanistically, through promoting p53 binding to the promoter of PUMA. However, knock down of KDM3A as such doesn't affect p53 level. In addition, KDM3A can interact with p53K372me1 in protein-protein interaction fashion, leading to the inactivation of p53, may eventually leading to chemoresistance of gastric cancer.
26514455	Molecular Screening for P53 Mutations among Tobacco Smokers in a Surveyof Awareness of Links between Tobacco, Alcohol Use and Cancer in Saudi Arabia.	Alshammari FD.	Roles of tobacco and alcohol use in etiology of cancer are well established. Alterationin in P53 have essential roles neoplastic change by preventing genome mutation; the aim of this study was to assess the association between P53 mutation and tobacco and alcohol consumption, as well as to assess the epidemiology of tobacco and alcohol use as risk factors for cancer in the adult population of northern Saudi civilians.A cross-sectional survey from October 2014 to January 2015, covering 3,398 adults, was performed. P53 mutation molecular detection was performed for 100 tobacco and alcohol users, usingDNA extracted from buccal cells.Of the 3,398 participants 3,253/3398(95.7%) responded, with a male female ratio of 1.10: 1.00. Out of these, 24.8% had smoked tobacco in their lifetime and 2.7% were consumers of alcoholic beverages. None was identified with any P53 mutation.The prevalence of tobacco smoking among the northern Saudi civilians was relatively high. Females' attitudes in tobacco and alcohol related issues were found to be affected by social stigma. Tobacco and alcohol use has no link to P53 gene mutations.
26113041	HIPK2 restricts SIRT1 activity upon severe DNA damage by a phosphorylation-controlled mechanism.	Conrad E, Polonio-Vallon T, Meister M, Matt S, Bitomsky N, Herbel C, Liebl M, Greiner V, Kriznik B, Schumacher S, Krieghoff-Henning E, Hofmann TG.	Upon severe DNA damage a cellular signalling network initiates a cell death response through activating tumour suppressor p53 in association with promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) nuclear bodies. The deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) suppresses cell death after DNA damage by antagonizing p53 acetylation. To facilitate efficient p53 acetylation, SIRT1 function needs to be restricted. How SIRT1 activity is regulated under these conditions remains largely unclear. Here we provide evidence that SIRT1 activity is limited upon severe DNA damage through phosphorylation by the DNA damage-responsive kinase HIPK2. We found that DNA damage provokes interaction of SIRT1 and HIPK2, which phosphorylates SIRT1 at Serine 682 upon lethal damage. Furthermore, upon DNA damage SIRT1 and HIPK2 colocalize at PML nuclear bodies, and PML depletion abrogates DNA damage-induced SIRT1 Ser682 phosphorylation. We show that Ser682 phosphorylation inhibits SIRT1 activity and impacts on p53 acetylation, apoptotic p53 target gene expression and cell death. Mechanistically, we found that DNA damage-induced SIRT1 Ser682 phosphorylation provokes disruption of the complex between SIRT1 and its activator AROS. Our findings indicate that phosphorylation-dependent restriction of SIRT1 activity by HIPK2 shapes the p53 response.Cell Death and Differentiation advance online publication, 26 June 2015; doi:10.1038/cdd.2015.75.
26270146	Label-free detection of missense mutations and methylation differences in the p53 gene using optically diffracting hydrogels.	MacConaghy KI, Chadly DM, Stoykovich MP, Kaar JL.	We have developed a novel approach for DNA detection as well as genetic screening of mutations by uniquely combining DNA-responsive and optically diffracting materials. This approach entails the polymerization of a photonic crystal within a hydrogel network that alters the diffraction of light in response to a target DNA strand. The utility of this approach, which permits label-free sensing, was demonstrated via the detection of a target sequence from the DNA binding domain of the major tumor suppressor protein p53. Using a complementary capture probe strand, we were able to detect down to picomole concentrations of the target p53 sequence. Moreover, we demonstrated that this approach could readily detect a single base pair mutation in the target strand, which corresponds to the hotspot cancer mutation R175H in p53. The sensitivity of detection was increased by lowering the rate of annealing of the target strand and adjusting the solution ionic strength during optical characterization. Changes in ionic strength during characterization impact the melting temperature of the bound target DNA and the Donnan potential between the hydrogel and solution, which influence detection. We further showed that this approach is sensitive to epigenetic changes via the detection of a fully methylated form of the target p53 sequence. Ultimately, this approach represents a new paradigm for DNA detection and specifically genetic screening of p53 as well as other disease markers and nucleotide modifications that alter the properties of DNA (e.g., epigenetic alterations and adducts with chemical carcinogens).
26418990	[Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia with P53 deletion and TCR-delta rearrangement in a case].	Xu X, Yang W, Zhang X.	OBJECTIVE To study the morphology, immunology, cyto- and molecular genetics of a patient with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenström macroglobulinemia (LPL/WM), deletion of P53 gene and rearrangement of clonal T cell receptors-delta (TCR-delta) gene. METHODS The cell morphology and immunocytochemistry were analyzed by bone marrow testing and biopsy. Cellular immunology was analyzed by flow cytometry. Genetic analysis was carried out by chromosome karyotyping, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Immunoglobulin M (IgM) in serum and urine was assayed by immunofixation electrophoresis. And the effect of chlorambucil therapy was evaluated. RESULTS Bone marrow biopsy suggested that the patient was of B lymphocyte type and had abnormal increase of lymphocytoid plasma cells, which were CD38 and CD138 positive. The patient had a normal male karyotype. FISH and PCR analysis of peripheral blood samples suggested deletion of P53 gene and rearrangement of TCR-delta gene. Immunofixation electrophoresis has detected IgM-kappa in both serum and urine. The patient showed partial response to chlorambucil. CONCLUSION In addition to typical clinical features, bone marrow examination, flow cytometry, histochemistry and immunophenotyping, testing for P53 gene deletion and lymphocyte gene rearrangement can facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of LPL/WM.
25243455	Complete remission of multiple lung metastases after ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma by transarterial infusion with the p53 gene.	Sheng S, Zheng J, Cui S, Cui X, Qian Z.	We describe the case of a 68-year-old man who presented with a massive lesion in the right liver. It was confirmed by preoperative aspiration biopsy to be a case of moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma, and the patient was shown by immunohistochemistry to have a mutation in the p53 gene. The hepatic lesion showed complete necrosis after arterial embolization combined with microwave ablation. During a re-examination 3 months after ablation, the α-fetoprotein level was found to have increased markedly. Bilateral pulmonary metastases were shown by a lung computed tomography scan, with a focal diameter smaller than 1 cm. Hepatic and bronchial intra-arterial infusion with the recombinant adenovirus p53 gene (rAd-p53) was performed twice. The second time the infusion was administered, interleukin-2 was used in combination with rAd-p53. After 2 months of treatment, the bilateral pulmonary lesions had almost disappeared. After 7 months of treatment, the bilateral pulmonary metastases disappeared completely, and no further recurrence has been identified in the lungs and liver.
25876645	Synergistic anticancer activity of capsaicin and 3,3'-diindolylmethane in human colorectal cancer.	Clark R, Lee J, Lee SH.	Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. A promising area of cancer research is focused on chemoprevention by nutritional compounds. Epidemiological studies have shown a strong negative correlation between fruit, vegetable, and spice intake and rates of cancer. Although individual active compounds have demonstrated significant anticancer activity, an emerging area of research is focusing on the combination of multiple dietary compounds that act synergistically on cancer to exert greater effects. The current study evaluated the potential synergistic effects of capsaicin, an active compound from red chili peppers, in combination with 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM), from cruciferous vegetables. A synergistic induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation was observed in human colorectal cancer cells treated with the combination of capsaicin and DIM. It was also observed that these two compounds activated transcriptional activity of NF-κB and p53 synergistically. Combination treatment stabilized nuclear p53 and up- or down-regulated expression of several target genes that are downstream of NF-κB and p53. The present study suggests capsaicin and DIM work synergistically to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in colorectal cancer through modulating transcriptional activity of NF-κB, p53, and target genes associated with apoptosis.
25675527	Propagation of aggregated p53: Cross-reaction and coaggregation vs. seeding.	Wang G, Fersht AR.	Destabilized mutant p53s coaggregate with WT p53, p63, and p73 in cancer cell lines. We found that stoichiometric amounts of aggregation-prone mutants induced only small amounts of WT p53 to coaggregate, and preformed aggregates did not significantly seed the aggregation of bulk protein. Similarly, p53 mutants trapped only small amounts of p63 and p73 into their p53 aggregates. Tetrameric full-length protein aggregated at similar rates and kinetics to isolated core domains, but there was some induced aggregation of WT by mutants in hetero-tetramers. p53 aggregation thus differs from the usual formation of amyloid fibril or prion aggregates where tiny amounts of preformed aggregate rapidly seed further aggregation. The proposed aggregation mechanism of p53 of rate-determining sequential unfolding and combination of two molecules accounts for the difference. A molecule of fast-unfolding mutant preferentially reacts with another molecule of mutant and only occasionally traps a slower unfolding WT molecule. The mutant population rapidly self-aggregates before much WT protein is depleted. Subsequently, WT protein self-aggregates at its normal rate. However, the continual production of mutant p53 in a cancer cell would gradually trap more and more WT and other proteins, accounting for the observations of coaggregates in vivo. The mechanism corresponds more to trapping by cross-reaction and coaggregation rather than classical seeding and growth.
26518362	Gene expression profiling reveals the role of RIG1 like receptor signaling in p53 dependent apoptosis induced by PUVA in keratinocytes.	Chowdhari S, Saini N.	Photochemotherapy using 8-methoxypsoralen in combination with UVA radiation (PUVA) is an effective treatment for various skin dermatosis including psoriasis however its molecular mechanism is not clear. Previously we demonstrated that PUVA differentially regulates miRNA expression profile with a significant up-regulation of hsa-miR-4516. To study in detail the molecular mechanism of PUVA in keratinocytes, we investigated the genome wide transcriptomic changes using Illumina whole genome gene expression beadchip. Microarray analysis revealed 1932 differentially expressed gene and their Insilico analysis revealed Retinoic Acid Inducible Gene-I (RIG-1) signaling, apoptosis and p53 pathway to be associated with PUVA induced effects. We demonstrate that miR-4516 mediated down-regulation of UBE2N promotes p53 nuclear translocation and pro-apoptotic activity of PUVA is independent of IRF3 but is mediated by the RIG-I in a p53 and NFκB dependent manner. Additionally, PUVA inactivated the AKT/mTOR pathway in concert with inhibition of autophagy and suppressed cell migration. Taken together this study broadens our understanding about the mechanism of action of PUVA providing possible new strategy targeting proapoptotic function of RIG-1, a regulator of innate immune response or p53 for psoriasis therapy.
26387755	HDAC8 Inhibition Specifically Targets Inv(16) Acute Myeloid Leukemic Stem Cells by Restoring p53 Acetylation.	Qi J, Singh S, Hua WK, Cai Q, Chao SW, Li L, Liu H, Ho Y, McDonald T, Lin A, Marcucci G, Bhatia R, Huang WJ, Chang CI, Kuo YH.	Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is driven and sustained by leukemia stem cells (LSCs) with unlimited self-renewal capacity and resistance to chemotherapy. Mutation in the TP53 tumor suppressor is relatively rare in de novo AML; however, p53 can be regulated through post-translational mechanisms. Here, we show that p53 activity is inhibited in inv(16)(+) AML LSCs via interactions with the CBFβ-SMMHC (CM) fusion protein and histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8). HDAC8 aberrantly deacetylates p53 and promotes LSC transformation and maintenance. HDAC8 deficiency or inhibition using HDAC8-selective inhibitors (HDAC8i) effectively restores p53 acetylation and activity. Importantly, HDAC8 inhibition induces apoptosis in inv(16)(+) AML CD34(+) cells, while sparing the normal hematopoietic stem cells. Furthermore, in vivo HDAC8i administration profoundly diminishes AML propagation and abrogates leukemia-initiating capacity of both murine and patient-derived LSCs. This study elucidates an HDAC8-mediated p53-inactivating mechanism promoting LSC activity and highlights HDAC8 inhibition as a promising approach to selectively target inv(16)(+) LSCs.
25772236	PML isoforms IV and V contribute to adenovirus-mediated oncogenic transformation by functionally inhibiting the tumor-suppressor p53.	Wimmer P, Berscheminski J, Blanchette P, Groitl P, Branton PE, Hay RT, Dobner T, Schreiner S.	Although modulation of the cellular tumor-suppressor p53 is considered to have the major role in E1A/E1B-55K-mediated tumorigenesis, other promyelocytic leukemia nuclear body (PML-NB)/PML oncogenic domain (POD)-associated factors including SUMO, Mre11, Daxx, as well as the integrity of these nuclear bodies contribute to the transformation process. However, the biochemical consequences and oncogenic alterations of PML-associated E1B-55K by SUMO-dependent PML-IV and PML-V interaction have so far remained elusive. We performed mutational analysis to define a PML interaction motif within the E1B-55K polypeptide. Our results showed that E1B-55K/PML binding is not required for p53, Mre11 and Daxx interaction. We also observed that E1B-55K lacking subnuclear PML localization because of either PML-IV or PML-V-binding deficiency was no longer capable of mediating E1B-55K-dependent SUMOylation of p53, inhibition of p53-mediated transactivation or efficiently transforming primary rodent cells. These results together with the observation that E1B-55K-dependent SUMOylation of p53 is required for efficient cell transformation, provides evidence for the idea that the SUMO ligase activity of the E1B-55K viral oncoprotein is intimately linked to its growth-promoting oncogenic activities.Oncogene advance online publication, 16 March 2015; doi:10.1038/onc.2015.63.
26296760	The influence of p53 status on the cytotoxicity of fluorinated pyrimidine L-nucleosides.	Murray V, Taylor CB, Gero AM, Lutze-Mann LH.	Fluorinated nucleoside analogues are a major class of cancer chemotherapy agents, and include the drugs 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FdUrd). The aim of this study was to examine the cellular toxicity of two novel fluorinated pyrimidine L-nucleosides that are enantiomers of D-nucleosides and may be able to increase selectivity for cancer cells as a result of their unnatural L-configuration. Two fluorinated pyrimidine L-nucleosides were examined in this study, L110 ([β-L, β-D]-5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine) and L117 (β-l-deoxyuridine:β-D-5'-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine). The cytotoxicity of these L-nucleoside was determined in primary mouse fibroblasts and was compared with 5FU and FdUrd. In addition, the influence of p53 status on cytotoxicity was investigated. These cytotoxicity assays were performed on a matched set of primary mouse fibroblasts that were either wild type or null for the p53 tumour suppressor gene. It was found that cells lacking functional p53 were over 7500 times more sensitive to the drugs L110, L117 and FdUrd than cells containing wild type p53.
26321517	Correlation of survivin, p53 and Ki-67 in laryngeal cancer Hep-2 cell proliferation and invasion.	Pei SG, Wang JX, Wang XL, Zhang QJ, Zhang H.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanism of survivin, p53 and Ki-67 on Hep-2 human laryngeal cancer endothelial cell proliferation and invasion. METHODS: Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and paracancerous normal tissues were collected, total RNA was extracted from tissues, survivin, p53 and Ki-67 gene mRNA expression levels in laryngeal cancer and the adjacent tissues were detected by Real-time PCR. Human laryngeal cancer Hep-2 epithelial cells were selected, survivin gene was overexpressed, and cell proliferation was detected by MTT. p53 and Ki-67 gene expression changes in overexpressed survivin gene were detected by Western blot. Changes in Hep-2 cell invasive ability were studied when survivin was overexpressed as detected by Transwell invasion assay. RESULTS: In the adjacent tissues, survivin, p53 and Ki-67 gene relative expression levels were 1.72 ± 0.9, 13.7 ± 5.7 and 5.7 ± 1.3, respectively; while in cancer tissues, gene relative expression levels were 53.7 ± 8.3, 66.7 ± 5.2 and 61.0 ± 3.1, respectively, which was significantly increased. As detected by MTT, relative cell survival rate within 12 h of survivin overexpression were: load control group (88.5 ± 1.6)%; overexpressed group (90.3 ± 1.9)%. Transwell invasion assay results indicated that overexpressed survivin could significantly increase the relative survival rate of cells. CONCLUSIONS: Expressions of p53, Ki67 and survivin are increased in cancer; and there is a positive correlation between survivin, p53 and Ki67 expressions in laryngeal carcinoma.
26367730	The expression of PD-L1 APE1 and P53 in hepatocellular carcinoma and its relationship to clinical pathology.	Kan G, Dong W.	OBJECTIVE: To study the expression of programmed death-ligand1 (PD-L1) in hepatocellular carcinoma and its relationship with clinicopathological characteristics and, prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma and APE1, P53 protein expression levels. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 128 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were enrolled in this study. The expression of PD-L1, APE1 and P53 were detected by immunohistochemistry.Use immunohistochemical ABC staining method to detect the expression levels of PD-L1, APE1 and P53 protein in the hepatocellular carcinoma of 128 cases. RESULTS: Positive The positive expression rates levels of PD-L1, APE1, and P53 protein in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues are were 82.03%, 92.19%, and 60.94%. PD-L1 positive expression were significantly associated with clinical stage, The PD-L1 protein has a high expression in patients with I ~ II stage liver cancerHBV infection positive and nonportal vein thrombosis (p=0.041; p=0.030; p=0.014). It is inversely correlated with P53 and PD-L1 expression (correlation coefficient -0.227, p=0.010), and positively correlated with APE1 expression (correlation coefficient 0.189, p=0.032). The expression of PD-L1 is associated with the survival time of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and the median survival time of patients with high expression of PD-L1 is ten months. The median survival time of patients with low expression is five months (p=0.001). The relationship between the expression of APE1 and P53 protein and overall survival time of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma has not been found. CONCLUSIONS: The PD-L1 and APE1 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma are related to the level of the expression of P53 protein. The expression state of PD-L1 may be a prognostic factor in hepatocellular carcinoma.
26323151	[Effect of Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma combined with Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma on p53 and p21 gene expression of IEC-6 cells].	Zheng F, Jiang ZB, Zhang X, Hu JP, Li SM, Zhao J, Zeng X.	To study the effect of the combined administration of different doses of Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma and Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma on the proliferation of DFMO-treated intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6) and p53, p21 mRNA and protein expressions, in order to define the molecular basis for the effect of the combined administration of different doses of Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma and Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma on the cell proliferation. The effect of the drugs on the cell division rate and cell cycle of IEC-6 cells was detected by FCM. Quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to analyze the effect of the drugs on mRNA of p2l and p53 related to IEC-6 proliferation. Western blot was used to analyze the effect of the drugs on p2l and p53 protein expressions of IEC-6 cells. Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma could increase p53, p21 mRNA and proteins expression in DFMO-treated IEC-6 cells. The combined administration of different ratios of Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma and Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma could significantly down-regulate Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma's effect on p53, p21 mRNA and proteins expression in DFMO-treated IEC-6 cells and promote the proliferation of IEC-6 cells. The combined administration of Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma and Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma could down-regulate Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma's effect on DFMO-treated intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6).
25908108	Gelsolin, NF-κB, and p53 expression in clear cell renal cell carcinoma: Impact on outcome.	Kankaya D, Kiremitci S, Tulunay O, Baltaci S.	OBJECTIVES: To examine the prognostic significance of Gelsolin, NF-κB, and p53 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CRCC), which has an unpredictable behavior and tendency for recurrence and metastasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was performed on 100 consecutive cases of CRCC using antibodies against Gelsolin, NF-κB, and p53. Tumors were grouped by nuclear grade (NG) as low NG (NG1, 2) or high NG (NG3, 4), and by pathological stage as localized (pT1, 2) or locally invasive (pT3, 4). Clinical stage was grouped as early stage (stage I, II) or late stage (stage III, IV). Evaluation was based on cytoplasmic (NF-κB(Cyt)) and nuclear (NF-κB(Nuc)) expression for NF-κB, nuclear expression for p53, membranous and cytoplasmic expression for Gelsolin. RESULTS: Gelsolin expression correlated with high NG (p = 0.001), metastasis (p = 0.003), late stage (p = 0.008), and cancer death (p = 0.001). NF-κB(Cyt) expression correlated with high NG (p = 0.002), perirenal invasion (p = 0.010), local invasion (p = 0.020), and late stage (p= 0.003). NF-κB(Nuc) expression failed to predict the prognosis of CRCC. p53 expression correlated with high NG (p = 0.045), lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.05), metastasis (p = 0.001), late stage (p = 0.028), and cancer death (p = 0.034). However, only Gelsolin was found to correlate with disease-specific survival, (p = 0.006), and neither NF-κB nor p53 showed such relation. CONCLUSION: Expressions of Gelsolin, NF-κB(Cyt), and p53 associated with aggressive behavior of CRCC, while Gelsolin expression specifically indicated poor disease-specific survival. The results of the present study served to determine biomarkers for predicting high-risk patients with CRCC, expected to show aggressive phenotype.
26017674	Has‑miR‑125a and 125b are induced by treatment with cisplatin in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and inhibit apoptosis in a p53‑dependent manner by targeting p53 mRNA.	Chen JJ, Liu SX, Chen MZ, Zhao ZY.	MicroRNA (miRNA) is a class of non‑coding RNA, which targets mRNAs of interest and suppresses its expression by degradation or translational inhibition. miRNA (miR)‑125a and miR‑125b were previously demonstrated to translationally and transcriptionally inhibit the expression of p53. The observed downregulation of the protein level of p53 in cisplatin‑treated patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) indicates the association between cisplatin resistance, miR‑125a and miR‑125b. In the present study, through the detection of the expression levels of miR‑125a and miR‑125b, a significant upregulation of these miRs was demonstrated in cisplatin‑treated patients with NPC. As a consequence, the protein expression level of p53 decreased notably. To confirm the induction of miR‑125a and miR‑125b by treatment with cisplatin, a cisplatin‑resistant TW03 cell model (TW03/DDP) was constructed. As expected, in the TW03/DDP cells, the expression levels of miR‑125a and miR‑125b were upregulated, and this caused downregulation of p53. Ectopic expression of these miRNAs in the TW03 cell model sensitized TW03 to cisplatin by decreasing the protein expression levels of p53, whereas ectopic expression in the antisense oligos of these microRNAs demonstrated the opposite effect. In addition, the present demonstrated that the cisplatin‑induced expression of miR‑125a and miR‑125b inhibited cisplatin‑induced apoptosis in the TW03 cells by decreasing the protein expression levels of p53. Taken together, the present study revealed for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that induction of the expression of miR‑125a and miR‑125b by treatment with cisplatin resulted in resistance to the cisplatin drug in the NPC cells.
26029824	Real-time and simultaneous monitoring of the phosphorylation and enhanced interaction of p53 and XPC acidic domains with the TFIIH p62 subunit.	Okuda M, Nishimura Y.	Posttranslational modifications have critical roles in diverse biological processes through interactions. Tumor-suppressor protein p53 and nucleotide excision repair factor XPC each contain an acidic region, termed the acidic transactivation domain (TAD) and acidic fragment (AF), respectively, that binds to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of the p62 subunit of the transcription factor TFIIH. Human p53-TAD contains seven serine and two threonine residues, all of which can be phosphorylated. Similarly, XPC-AF contains six serine and two threonine residues, of which Thr117, Ser122 and Ser129 have been reported as phosphorylation sites in vivo, although their phosphorylation roles are unknown. Phosphorylation of Ser46 and Thr55 of p53-TAD increases its binding ability; however, the role of XPC-AF phosphorylation remains elusive. Here we describe a system for real-time and simultaneous monitoring of the phosphorylation and p62-PH affinity of p53-TAD and XPC-AF using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Unexpectedly, among seven reported kinases that presumably phosphorylate Ser46 and/or Thr55 of p53-TAD, only two specific and high-efficiency enzymes were identified: JNK2α2 for Ser46 and GRK5 for Thr55. During interaction with p62-PH, four different affinity complexes resulting from various phosphorylation states of p53-TAD by the kinases were identified. The kinetics of the site-specific phosphorylation reaction of p53-TAD and its affinity for p62-PH were monitored in real-time using the NMR system. Isothermic calorimetry showed that phosphorylation of Ser129 of XPC-AF increases binding to p62-PH. Although CK2 was predicted to phosphorylate Ser122, Ser129 and Ser140 from its sequence context, it specifically and efficiently phosphorylated only Ser129. Simultaneous monitoring of the phosphorylation and augmentation in p62-PH binding identified a key residue of p62-PH for contacting phosphorylated Ser129. In summary, we have established an NMR system for real-time and simultaneous monitoring of site-specific phosphorylation and enhancement of affinity between phosphorylation domains and their target. The system is also applicable to other posttranslational modifications.
25232917	Clinical impact of SNP of P53 genes pathway on the adult AML patients.	Abdel Hamid TM, El Gammal MM, Eibead GT, Saber MM, Abol Elazm OM.	INTRODUCTION: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly heterogeneous disease, with biologically and prognostically different subtypes. AIM: To study the impact of p53, p21, and mdm2 gene polymorphisms on the clinical outcome in adult AML patients treated at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) - Cairo University. METHODS: Forty-eight adult AML patients presented to the Medical Oncology Department, NCI, from April 2010 till November 2011. Clinical data and bone marrow samples were obtained. Molecular genetic analysis involving P53, MDM2, and P21 single-nucleotide gene polymorphisms was done using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism coupled analysis. RESULTS: The mean age was 35.7 years. After a median follow-up period of 12 months, 28 patients (58.4%) achieved complete remission (CR) and the overall survival (OS) was 8.7 months. Patients with homozygous Arg/arg at codon 72 of P53 had a better median OS months than Arg/Pro and Pro/Pro (13.4 vs. 8.4 vs. 1.5 months, respectively; P = 0.045). P53/p21 combination had a better median OS and disease-free survival (DFS) of 12.1 and 13.7 months for wild type cases (GG + Ser/ser) and 20.3 and 20.7 months for patients with either variant genes (GC + Ser/arg) compared with 1.1 and 1.9 months for patients with both variant genes (CC + arg/arg), (P = 0.037 and 0.004). The presence of wild genotype of either P21 or MDM2 may abolish the effect of P53 homozygous variant genotype on the OS. Neither p21nor mdm2 polymorphism alone showed an impact on OS or DFS. CR was not affected by any of the three gene polymorphisms. CONCLUSION: The p53 pathway gene polymorphisms may affect the OS of adult AML patients.
25404486	Selective ROS-dependent p53-associated anticancer effects of the hypoxoside derivative rooperol on human teratocarcinomal cancer stem-like cells.	Ali Azouaou S, Emhemmed F, Idris-Khodja N, Lobstein A, Schini-Kerth V, Muller CD, Fuhrmann G.	Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are potential targets for innovative anticancer therapies that involve natural products with potential chemopreventive effects. We therefore analyzed the antineoplastic activity of rooperol, the aglycone of the plant-derived compound hypoxoside, on a model of Oct4-expressing cancer stem-like cell, i.e. the human embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell NT2/D1. Rooperol selectively inhibited the proliferation of NT2/D1 cells in a concentration-dependent manner and had no effect on either normal embryonic fibroblasts which are more restrictive pluripotent stem cells or on NCCIT p53-mutant EC cells. Accordingly, rooperol only eliminates colon carcinoma cells expressing p53. Rooperol treatment triggered cell death on NT2/D1 cells through the alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Rooperol-induced apoptosis was associated with activation of p53 and concentration-dependent changes of the expression levels of both caspase 3 and poly ADP ribose polymerase type 1 cleaved subunits. These modifications were accompanied by a downregulation of Oct4 and its two partners involved in the maintenance of cell pluripotency and self-renewal, Nanog and Sox2.Treatment with intracellular membrane permeant O2 (-) scavengers prevented rooperol-induced apoptosis and upregulation of the expression of p53 and active caspase-3. Our findings indicate that rooperol mediates its growth inhibitory effects on CSCs via a mitochondrial redox-sensitive mechanism. We propose that abrogating the expression of the stemness regulators is a prerequisite for rooperol to fully exert its pro-apoptotic properties on wild-type p53-bearing CSCs.
25435943	p53, MDM2, eIF4E and EGFR expression in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and their correlation with clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis: A retrospective study.	Zhang P, Wu SK, Wang Y, Fan ZX, Li CR, Feng M, Xu P, Wang WD, Lang JY.	In the present study, the expression of p53, mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were investigated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), and the correlation between their expression and clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis was analyzed. The medical records of 96 NPC patients who had undergone biopsy prior to radical radiotherapy and chemotherapy between 2005 and 2009 were reviewed, retrospectively. All patients received intensity-modulated radiotherapy with concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were followed-up for three years. Streptavidin-peroxidase immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the expression of p53, MDM2, eIF4E and EGFR in NPC biopsy specimens, and the association between their expression and clinical parameters and survival was analyzed. The p53, MDM2, eIF4E and EGFR expression rates were 65.6% (63/96), 79.16% (76/96), 77.08% (74/96) and 89.5% (86/96), respectively. p53 (χ(2),20.322; P=0.001) and EGFR (χ(2),8.337; P=0.005) expression were found to correlate with T stage, whereas MDM2 (χ(2),16.361; P=0.001) expression was found to correlate with lymph node metastasis. p53 expression was found to inversely correlate with MDM2 expression (r, -3.24; P<0.05). Three-year survival rates were lower in p53-positive (76.2%) patients when compared with p53-negative (93.9%) patients. In addition, three-year survival rates were lower in EGFR-positive (75.8%) patients than in EGFR-negative patients (91.2%). The Cox proportional-hazards regression model revealed that p53 (β,-0.455; χ(2),5.491; P=0.019) and EGFR (β, 3.93; χ(2), 11.95; P=0.001) expression were independent prognostic factors. Thus, it was hypothesized that p53 and EGFR expression present potential unfavorable prognostic markers for patients with NPC.
25438952	Rapamycin protects against apoptotic neuronal death and improves neurologic function after traumatic brain injury in mice via modulation of the mTOR-p53-Bax axis.	Ding K, Wang H, Wu Y, Zhang L, Xu J, Li T, Ding Y, Zhu L, He J.	BACKGROUND: Rapamycin has proven to be a neuroprotective agent in traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, there is a lack of data regarding the effect of rapamycin on apoptotic neuronal death after TBI. Thus, the present study was designed to detect the modulatory role of rapamycin on apoptosis and explore the potential involvement of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-p53-Bax axis after TBI. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Neurologic severity score tests were performed to measure behavioral outcomes. The effect of rapamycin treatment on neuronal death was analyzed using immunofluorescence analysis of NeuN. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick 3'-end labeling was performed to detect apoptotic cells. The expression of Bax and phosphorylated protein of p53 was detected using Western blotting analyses and immunofluorescence staining. Phosphorylated protein of the mTOR in the ipsilateral cortex was detected using Western blotting analyses. RESULTS: Rapamycin administration after TBI was associated with an increased number of neurons, decreased apoptosis index, and improved neurobehavioral function, which was potentially mediated by inactivation of the mTOR-p53-Bax axis. CONCLUSIONS: Rapamycin can protect neurons from apoptotic neuronal death after TBI. This study presents a new insight into the antiapoptosis mechanisms, which are responsible for the neuroprotection of rapamycin, with the potential involvement of the mTOR-p53-Bax axis.
25526924	Lipoic acid induces p53-independent cell death in colorectal cancer cells and potentiates the cytotoxicity of 5-fluorouracil.	Dörsam B, Göder A, Seiwert N, Kaina B, Fahrer J.	Alpha-lipoic acid (LA), which plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial energy metabolism, is an endogenous dithiol compound with an array of antioxidative functions. It has been shown that LA triggers cell death in tumor cell lines, whereas non-transformed cells are hardly affected. In the present study, we analyzed the cytotoxicity of LA on colorectal cancer (CRC) cells differing in their p53 status and investigated a putative synergistic effect with the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). We show that LA induces a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability, which was independent of the p53 status as attested in isogenic p53-proficient and p53-deficient cell lines. This effect was largely attributable to cell death induction as revealed by Annexin-V/PI staining. LA-treated HCT116 cells underwent caspase-dependent and caspase-independent cell death, which was blocked by the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD and the RIP-kinase inhibitor Necrostatin-1, respectively. In CaCO-2 and HT29 cells, LA induced caspase-dependent cell demise via activation of caspase-9, caspase-3 and caspase-7 with subsequent PARP-1 cleavage as demonstrated by immunoblot analysis, activity assays and pan-caspase inhibition. Interestingly, LA treatment did neither activate p53 nor induced genotoxic effects as shown by lack of DNA strand breaks and phosphorylation of histone 2AX. Finally, we provide evidence that LA increases the cytotoxic effect induced by the anticancer drug 5-FU as revealed by significantly enhanced cell death rates in HCT116 and CaCO-2 cells. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that LA induces CRC cell death independent of their p53 status and potentiates the cytotoxicity of 5-FU without causing DNA damage on its own, which makes it a candidate for tumor therapy.
25543961	Preservation of cardiac function in left ventricle cardiac hypertrophy using an AAV vector which provides VEGF-A expression in response to p53.	Bajgelman MC, dos Santos L, Silva GJ, Nakamuta J, Sirvente RA, Chaves M, Krieger JE, Strauss BE.	Here we present the application of our adeno-associated virus (AAV2) vector where transgene expression is driven by a synthetic, p53-responsive promoter, termed PG, used to supply human vascular endothelial growth factor-A165 (VEGF-A). Thus, p53 is harnessed to promote the beneficial expression of VEGF-A encoded by the AAVPG vector, bypassing the negative effect of p53 on HIF-1α which occurs during cardiac hypertrophy. Wistar rats were submitted to pressure overload induced by thoracic aorta coarctation (TAC) with or without concomitant gene therapy (intramuscular delivery in the left ventricle). After 12 weeks, rats receiving AAVPG-VEGF gene therapy were compared to those that did not, revealing significantly improved cardiac function under hemodynamic stress, lack of fibrosis and reversal of capillary rarefaction. With these functional assays, we have demonstrated that application of the AAVPG-VEGF vector under physiologic conditions known to stimulate p53 resulted in the preservation of cardiac performance.
25637534	Quiescence does not affect p53 and stress response by irradiation in human lung fibroblasts.	Dai J, Itahana K, Baskar R.	Cells in many organs exist in both proliferating and quiescent states. Proliferating cells are more radio-sensitive, DNA damage pathways including p53 pathway are activated to undergo either G1/S or G2/M arrest to avoid entering S and M phase with DNA damage. On the other hand, quiescent cells are already arrested in G0, therefore there may be fundamental difference of irradiation response between proliferating and quiescent cells, and this difference may affect their radiosensitivity. To understand these differences, proliferating and quiescent human normal lung fibroblasts were exposed to 0.10-1 Gy of γ-radiation. The response of key proteins involved in the cell cycle, cell death, and metabolism as well as histone H2AX phosphorylation were examined. Interestingly, p53 and p53 phosphorylation (Ser-15), as well as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27, were induced similarly in both proliferating and quiescent cells after irradiation. Furthermore, the p53 protein half-life, and expression of cyclin A, cyclin E, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), Bax, or cytochrome c expression as well as histone H2AX phosphorylation were comparable after irradiation in both phases of cells. The effect of radioprotection by a glycogen synthase kinase 3β inhibitor on p53 pathway was also similar between proliferating and quiescent cells. Our results showed that quiescence does not affect irradiation response of key proteins involved in stress and DNA damage at least in normal fibroblasts, providing a better understanding of the radiation response in quiescent cells, which is crucial for tissue repair and regeneration.
25730031	Construction of the mammalian expressing vector pEGFP-N1-P53 and its expression successful in chicken fibroblast cells and blastoderm.	Song Z, Li ZH, Lei XQ, Xu TS, Zhang XH, Li YJ, Zhang GM, Xi SM, Yang YB, Wei ZG.	The enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) pEGFP-N1-P53 eukaryotic expression vector, which contains the human tumor suppressor p53, was constructed and transfected into chicken fibroblast cells and stage-X blastoderm to analyze the transfection efficiency. The complementary DNA of the human p53 gene was cloned by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from human peripheral blood and inserted into the pEGFP-N1 vector by HindIII and BamHI double digestion. The pEGFP-N1-P53 vector was transfected into chicken embryo fibroblasts by Lipofectamine 2000 liposomes, and the transfection efficiency was analyzed by fluorescence microscope after 36 h of transfection. The stage-X blastoderm was also transfected by blastoderm injection using Lipofectamine 2000 liposomes at room temperature after 12-24 h; then hatching occurred until seventh day, and the transfection efficiency was analyzed by fluorescence microscope in the dead embryo. A total of 90 hatching eggs were transfected by the pEGFP-N1-P53 vector, and 20 chicken embryos expressed the reporter gene, which indicated that recombinant pEGFP-N1-P53 could be transfected and expressed in stage-X blastoderm by liposomes. Chicken embryo fibroblasts were transfected and expressed the reporter gene. The pEGFP-N1-P53 vector was constructed successfully and could be transfected and expressed in chicken embryo fibroblasts and stage-X blastoderms efficiently.
25758227	Histone deacetylase 1 and 2 regulate Wnt and p53 pathways in the ureteric bud epithelium.	Chen S, Yao X, Li Y, Saifudeen Z, Bachvarov D, El-Dahr SS.	Histone deacetylases (HDACs) regulate a broad range of biological processes through removal of acetyl groups from histones as well as non-histone proteins. Our previous studies showed that Hdac1 and Hdac2 are bound to promoters of key renal developmental regulators and that HDAC activity is required for embryonic kidney gene expression. However, the existence of many HDAC isoforms in embryonic kidneys raises questions concerning the possible specificity or redundancy of their functions. We report here that targeted deletion of both the Hdac1 and Hdac2 genes from the ureteric bud (UB) cell lineage of mice causes bilateral renal hypodysplasia. One copy of either Hdac1 or Hdac2 is sufficient to sustain normal renal development. In addition to defective cell proliferation and survival, genome-wide transcriptional profiling revealed that the canonical Wnt signaling pathway is specifically impaired in UB(Hdac1,2-/-) kidneys. Our results also demonstrate that loss of Hdac1 and Hdac2 in the UB epithelium leads to marked hyperacetylation of the tumor suppressor protein p53 on lysine 370, 379 and 383; these post-translational modifications are known to boost p53 stability and transcriptional activity. Genetic deletion of p53 partially rescues the development of UB(Hdac1,2-/-) kidneys. Together, these data indicate that Hdac1 and Hdac2 are crucial for kidney development. They perform redundant, yet essential, cell lineage-autonomous functions via p53-dependent and -independent pathways.
25757624	P53 deficiency-induced Smad1 upregulation suppresses tumorigenesis and causes chemoresistance in colorectal cancers.	Ruan X, Zuo Q, Jia H, Chau J, Lin J, Ao J, Xia X, Liu H, Habib SL, Fu C, Li B.	The DNA damage response helps to maintain genome integrity, suppress tumorigenesis, and mediate the effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Our previous studies have shown that Smad1 is upregulated and activated by Atm in DNA damage response, which can further bind to p53 and promote p53 stabilization. Here we report another aspect of the interplay between p53 and Smad1. Comparison of rectal tumor against paired paraneoplastic specimens and analysis of >500 colorectal tumors revealed that Smad1 was upregulated in tumor samples, which was attributable to p53 defects. Using MEFs as a model, we found that knockdown of the elevated Smad1 in p53(-/-) MEFs promoted cell proliferation, E1A/Ras-induced cell transformation, and tumorigenesis. Mechanistic studies suggest that elevated Smad1 and momentary activation inhibit cell proliferation by upregulating p57Kip2 and enhancing Atm-Chk2 activation. Surprisingly, elevated Smad1 appears to have a negative effect on chemotherapy, as colorectal tumors, primary cancer cells, and cell lines with Smad1 knockdown all showed an increase in chemosensitivity, which could be attributable to elevated p57Kip2. These findings underscore the significance of Smad1-p53 interaction in tumor suppression and reveal an unexpected role for Smad1 in chemoresistance of colorectal cancers.
26417421	CHEMICAL SELECTIVITY OF NUCLEOBASE ADDUCTION RELATIVE TO IN VIVO MUTATION SITES ON EXON 7 FRAGMENT OF P53 TUMOR SUPPRESSOR GENE.	Malla S, Kadimisetty K, Fu YJ, Choudhary D, Jansson I, Schenkman JB, Rusling JF.	Damage to p53 tumor suppressor gene is found in half of all human cancers. Databases integrating studies of large numbers of tumors and cancer cell cultures show that mutation sites of specific p53 codons are correlated with specific types of cancers. If the most frequently damaged p53 codons in vivo correlate with the most frequent chemical damage sites in vitro, predictions of organ-specific cancer risks might result. Herein, we describe LC-MS/MS methodology to reveal codons with metabolite-adducted nucleobases by LC-MS/MS for oligonucleotides longer than 20 base pairs. Specifically, we used a known carcinogen, benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE) to determine the most frequently adducted nucleobases within codons. We used a known sequence of 32 base pairs (bp) representing part of p53 exon 7 with 5 possible reactive hot spots. This is the first nucleobase reactivity study of a double stranded DNA p53 fragment featuring more than 20 base pairs with multiple reactive sites. We reacted the 32 bp fragment with benzo[a]pyrene metabolite BPDE that undergoes nucleophilic substitution by DNA bases. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used for sequencing of oligonucleotide products from the reacted 32 bp fragment after fragmentation by a restriction endonuclease. Analysis of the adducted p53 fragment compared with unreacted fragment revealed guanines of codons 248 and 244 as most frequently targeted, which are also mutated with high frequency in human tumors. Codon 248 is mutated in non-small cell and small cell lung, head and neck, colorectal and skin cancer, while codon 244 is mutated in small cell lung cancer, all of which involve possible BDPE exposure. Results suggest the utility of this approach for screening of adducted p53 gene by drugs and environmental chemicals to predict risks for organ specific cancers.
26222667	p53-p66(shc)/miR-21-Sod2 signaling is critical for the inhibitory effect of betulinic acid on hepatocellular carcinoma.	Yang J, Qiu B, Li X, Zhang H, Liu W.	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancy and the third cause of cancer-related death. Betulinic acid (BA) is a pentacyclic triterpene, possessing potential pro-apoptotic activities. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of BA on tumor growth in mice and HCC cell proliferation in vitro. We found that BA dose-dependently inhibited tumor growth in mice induced by DEN plus CCl4 (D/C) and suppressed cell viability and proliferation in several HCC cell lines. In addition, BA increased mitochondrial ROS generation and mitochondrial dysfunction, activating molecular apoptotic events and leading to apoptotic cell death. p53 was increased by BA in D/C-treated mice and HCC cells and inhibition of p53 significantly suppressed the pro-apoptotic and anti-tumor effect of BA. Increase of p66(shc) was involved in the pro-apoptotic and anti-tumor effect of BA. Moreover, BA-induced increase of p66(shc) was dependent upon p53. Sod2 expression was reduced by BA treatment, and a Sod2 mimic (MnTBAP) significantly blocked the pro-apoptotic and anti-tumor effect of BA. Furthermore, miR-21 was increased by BA in D/C-treated mice and HCC cells and inhibition of miR-21 significantly suppressed the pro-apoptotic effect of BA. miR-21 inhibitor attenuated BA-induced decrease of Sod2 and p53 inhibitor blocked BA-induced increase of miR-21. These results demonstrated that p53 is responsible for the anti-tumor effect of BA through up-regulation of p66(shc) and miR-21 and down-regulation of Sod2 expression, leading to mitochondrial ROS accumulation and apoptosis. The p53-p66(shc)/miR-21-Sod2 signaling is critical for BA-inhibited tumor growth and cancer cell proliferation.
26251031	Expression of p53 synergistically augments caspases-mediated apoptosis induced by replication-competent adenoviruses in pancreatic carcinoma cells.	Takei Y, Okamoto S, Kawamura K, Jiang Y, Morinaga T, Shingyoji M, Sekine I, Kubo S, Tada Y, Tatsumi K, Shimada H, Hiroshima K, Yamaguchi N, Tagawa M.	We examined cytotoxicity of replication-competent type 5 adenoviruses (Ad5) in human pancreatic carcinoma cells with a p53-defective genotype. The replication-competent Ad5 of which E1A gene was activated by exogenous transcriptional regulatory sequences, derived from the midkine and survivin genes, achieved cytotoxicity to the pancreatic carcinoma. These cells were susceptible to replication-incompetent Ad5 expressing the wild-type p53 gene. We also produced the replication-competent Ad5 bearing the same exogenous regulatory sequences and the type 35 Ad-derived fiber-knob region, and showed that the cytotoxicity was comparable to that of the replication-competent Ad5 prototype. We then investigated possible combinatory effects of the fiber-modified replication-competent Ad and Ad5 expressing the wild-type p53 gene, both of which did not interfere respective infections. The combination produced synergistic cytotoxic effects with enhanced cleavages of caspase-3 and PARP molecules, and with increased sub-G1 fractions and annexin V-positive populations although the viral production of the replication-competent Ad was rather suppressed by expressed p53. Pancreatic cells infected with both Ad showed increase of p53 and decrease of MDM2 and p21 levels, compared with those infected with Ad expressing the p53 gene. These data collectively indicated that replication-competent Ad augmented susceptibility of pancreatic cells to apoptosis through upregulated p53 expression.
25618595	Design and synthesis of new bioisosteres of spirooxindoles (MI-63/219) as anti-breast cancer agents.	Kumar A, Gupta G, Bishnoi AK, Saxena R, Saini KS, Konwar R, Kumar S, Dwivedi A.	We report herein the design and synthesis of bioisosteres of spirooxindole (MI-63/219), a small-molecule inhibitors of the MDM2-p53 interaction as anti-breast cancer agents. Compound 5b has been exhibiting significant anti-proliferative activity in nude mice bearing MCF-7 xenograft tumor. The compound 5b was found to act via modulation of MDM2 and p53 expression in breast cancer cells expressing wild type p53. Compound 5b stimulated p53 activation, caused modulation of downstream effectors p21, pRb, and cyclin D1 which regulate cell cycle. Thus, compound triggered G1-S phase cell cycle arrest, which was evident by flow cytometric analysis of treated breast cancer cells. Thus, compound 5b restores the p53 function, which triggers molecular events consistent with cell cycle arrest at G1/S phase.
25619836	Three-dimensional microenvironment confers enhanced sensitivity to doxorubicin by reducing p53-dependent induction of autophagy.	Gomes LR, Vessoni AT, Menck CF.	Preclinical studies of anticancer drugs are typically performed using cancer cell lines maintained in two-dimensional (2D) cultures, ignoring the influences of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and three-dimensional (3D) microenvironment. In this study, we evaluated the microenvironmental control of human breast cancer cells responses to doxorubicin (DOXO) using the 3D laminin-rich ECM (3D lrECM) cell culture model. Under 3D culture conditions, MCF-7 cells displayed drastic morphological alterations, a decrease in proliferation and elevated sensitivity to DOXO. Interestingly, the chemotherapy-mediated activation of autophagy was compromised in the 3D matrix, suggesting an association between the increased cytotoxicity of DOXO and hindered autophagy induction. Indeed, while chloroquine or ATG5 knockdown potentiated DOXO-induced cell death under the 2D culture conditions, the autophagy inducer rapamycin improved the resistance of 3D-cultured cells to this drug. Moreover, in the monolayer-cultured cells, DOXO treatment led to increases in p53 and DRAM-1 expression, which is a p53-dependent activator of autophagy that functions in response to DNA damage. Conversely, p53 and DRAM-1 expression was impaired in 3D-cultured cells. The knockdown of p53 by shRNA blocked DRAM-1 activation, impaired autophagy induction and sensitized only those cells maintained under 2D conditions to DOXO. In addition, 2D-cultured MDA-MB-231 cells (a p53-mutated breast cancer cell line) not only showed increased sensitivity to DOXO compared with MCF-7 cells but also failed to induce DRAM-1 expression or autophagy. Similar to p53 silencing, DRAM-1 knockdown potentiated DOXO cytotoxicity only in 2D-cultured cells. These results suggest that the 3D tissue microenvironment controls tumor cell sensitivity to DOXO treatment by preventing p53-DRAM-autophagy axis activation.
25445786	Sirtuin 7 promotes cellular survival following genomic stress by attenuation of DNA damage, SAPK activation and p53 response.	Kiran S, Oddi V, Ramakrishna G.	Maintaining the genomic integrity is a constant challenge in proliferating cells. Amongst various proteins involved in this process, Sirtuins play a key role in DNA damage repair mechanisms in yeast as well as mammals. In the present work we report the role of one of the least explored Sirtuin viz., SIRT7, under conditions of genomic stress when treated with doxorubicin. Knockdown of SIRT7 sensitized osteosarcoma (U2OS) cells to DNA damage induced cell death by doxorubicin. SIRT7 overexpression in NIH3T3 delayed cell cycle progression by causing delay in G1 to S transition. SIRT7 overexpressing cells when treated with low dose of doxorubicin (0.25 µM) showed delayed onset of senescence, lesser accumulation of DNA damage marker γH2AX and lowered levels of growth arrest markers viz., p53 and p21 when compared to doxorubicin treated control GFP expressing cells. Resistance to DNA damage following SIRT7 overexpression was also evident by EdU incorporation studies where cellular growth arrest was significantly delayed. When treated with higher dose of doxorubicin (>1 µM), SIRT7 conferred resistance to apoptosis by attenuating stress activated kinases (SAPK viz., p38 and JNK) and p53 response thereby shifting the cellular fate towards senescence. Interestingly, relocalization of SIRT7 from nucleolus to nucleoplasm together with its co-localization with SAPK was an important feature associated with DNA damage. SIRT7 mediated resistance to doxorubicin induced apoptosis and senescence was lost when p53 level was restored by nutlin treatment. Overall, we propose SIRT7 attenuates DNA damage, SAPK activation and p53 response thereby promoting cellular survival under conditions of genomic stress.
26470726	Apoptosis of Sertoli cells after conditional ablation of murine double minute 2 (Mdm2) gene is p53-dependent and results in male sterility.	Fouchécourt S, Livera G, Messiaen S, Fumel B, Parent AS, Marine JC, Monget P.	Beside its well-documented role in carcinogenesis, the function of p53 family has been more recently revealed in development and female reproduction, but it is still poorly documented in male reproduction. We specifically tested this possibility by ablating Mdm2, an E3 ligase that regulates p53 protein stability and transactivation function, specifically in Sertoli cells (SCs) using the AMH-Cre line and created the new SC-Mdm2(-/-) line. Heterozygous SC-Mdm2(-/+) adult males were fertile, but SC-Mdm2(-/-) males were infertile and exhibited: a shorter ano-genital distance, an extra duct along the vas deferens that presents a uterus-like morphology, degenerated testes with no organized seminiferous tubules and a complete loss of differentiated germ cells. In adults, testosterone levels as well as StAR, P450c17 (Cyp17a1) and P450scc (Cyp11a1) mRNA levels decreased significantly, and both plasma LH and FSH levels increased. A detailed investigation of testicular development indicated that the phenotype arose during fetal life, with SC-Mdm2(-/-) testes being much smaller at birth. Interestingly, Leydig cells remained present until adulthood and fetal germ cells abnormally initiated meiosis. Inactivation of Mdm2 in SCs triggered p53 activation and apoptosis as early as 15.5 days post conception with significant increase in apoptotic SCs. Importantly, testis development occurred normally in SC-Mdm2(-/-) lacking p53 mice (SC-Mdm2(-/-)p53(-/-)) and accordingly, these mice were fertile indicating that the aforementioned phenotypes are entirely p53-dependent. These data not only highlight the importance of keeping p53 in check for proper testicular development and male fertility but also certify the critical role of SCs in the maintenance of meiotic repression.Cell Death and Differentiation advance online publication, 16 October 2015; doi:10.1038/cdd.2015.120.
26477317	The p53 tetramer shows an induced-fit interaction of the C-terminal domain with the DNA-binding domain.	D'Abramo M, Bešker N, Desideri A, Levine AJ, Melino G, Chillemi G.	The Trp53 gene is the most frequently mutated gene in all human cancers. Its protein product p53 is a very powerful transcription factor that can activate different biochemical pathways and affect the regulation of metabolism, senescence, DNA damage response, cell cycle and cell death. The understanding of its function at the molecular level could be of pivotal relevance for therapy. Investigation of long-range intra- and interdomain communications in the p53 tetramer-DNA complex was performed by means of an atomistic model that included the tetramerization helices in the C-terminal domain, the DNA-binding domains and a consensus DNA-binding site of 18 base pairs. Nonsymmetric dynamics are illustrated in the four DNA-binding domains, with loop L1 switching from inward to outward conformations with respect to the DNA major groove. Direct intra- and intermonomeric long-range communications between the tetramerization and DNA-binding domains are noted. These long-distance conformational changes link the C terminus with the DNA-binding domain and provide a biophysical rationale for the reported functional regulation of the p53 C-terminal region. A fine characterization of the DNA deformation caused by p53 binding is obtained, with 'static' deformations always present and measured by the slide parameter in the central thymine-adenine base pairs; we also detect 'dynamic' deformations switched on and off by particular p53 tetrameric conformations and measured by the roll and twist parameters in the same base pairs. These different conformations can indeed modulate the electrostatic potential isosurfaces of the whole p53-DNA complex. These results provide a molecular/biophysical understanding of the evident role of the C terminus in post-translational modification that regulates the transcriptional function of p53. Furthermore, the unstructured C terminus is able to facilitate contacts between the core DNA-binding domains of the tetramer.Oncogene advance online publication, 19 October 2015; doi:10.1038/onc.2015.388.
25616665	MicroRNA-520g confers drug resistance by regulating p21 expression in colorectal cancer.	Zhang Y, Geng L, Talmon G, Wang J.	Development of drug resistance is one of the major causes of colorectal cancer recurrence, yet mechanistic understanding and therapeutic options remain limited. Here, we show that expression of microRNA (miR)-520g is correlated with drug resistance of colon cancer cells. Ectopic expression of miR-520g conferred resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)- or oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis in vitro and reduced the effectiveness of 5-FU in the inhibition of tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model in vivo. Further studies indicated that miR-520g mediated drug resistance through down-regulation of p21 expression. Moreover, p53 suppressed miR-520g expression, and deletion of p53 up-regulated miR-520g expression. Inhibition of miR-520g in p53(-/-) cells increased their sensitivity to 5-FU treatment. Importantly, studies of patient samples indicated that expression of miR-520g correlated with chemoresistance in colorectal cancer. These findings indicate that the p53/miR-520g/p21 signaling axis plays an important role in the response of colorectal cancer to chemotherapy. A major implication of our studies is that inhibition of miR-520g or restoration of p21 expression may have considerable therapeutic potential to overcome drug resistance in colorectal cancer patients, especially in those with mutant p53.
26494558	Functional studies of miR-130a on the inhibitory pathways of apoptosis in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.	Zhu X, Zhao H, Lin Z, Zhang G.	The p53 mutation in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) led to decreased overall survival and therapy resistance which was also closely correlated with the downstream proto-oncogenes BCL-2, TCL-1 and MCL-1. We in this study aimed to investigate the function of miR130a in p53 tumor suppressor signaling pathway. We performed microRNA (miRNA) expression profile analysis in CML cancer stem cells of 38 cases and extracted total RNA from peripheral blood of 143 cases. Standard curves of U6 and miRNA were made from 10-fold serial dilutions of the cDNA, which were quantified using real-time quantitative PCR with SYBR Green by ABI 7300. The p53 mutations and BCR/ABL mutation status analysis in CML patients were detected by PCR and direct sequencing. Candidate targets of miR130a of putative relevance in CML pathogenesis were analyzed by bioinformatics approach. We then used dual-luciferase activity assay to verify the target genes of miR130a and used western blot analysis to elucidate the mechanism of miR130a on modulating drug resistance. The levels of miR-130a expression in CML were significantly lower in poor prognostic subgroups, defined by prognostic factors including mutated BCR/ABL status, p53 and ATM deletions and p53 mutations. Furthermore, underexpression of miR-130a was significantly associated with shorter overall survival and treatment-free survival in CML patients. We demonstrated that miR130a function as tumor suppressors by inhibiting multiple anti-apoptosis proteins, including BCL-2, MCL-1 and XIAP. This was a direct effect because miR130a negatively regulated expression of a BCL-2/MCL-1/XIAP 3'untranslated region-based reporter construct. Transfection of miR130a mimics into CML cells from 30 patients without p53 aberrations led to significant increases in apoptosis compared with transfection with the miRNA control. Besides, enforced expression of miR130a had no significant drug-sensitization effect in CML cells from p53-attenuated patients. MiR-130a may have an important role in the pathogenesis of CML and may be useful for assessing prognosis in patients with CML. Moreover, miR130a may provide a possible therapeutic avenue and a sensitive indicator of the activity of the p53 in CML.Cancer Gene Therapy advance online publication, 23 October 2015; doi:10.1038/cgt.2015.50.
26494468	DNA damage-induced ephrin-B2 reverse signaling promotes chemoresistance and drives EMT in colorectal carcinoma harboring mutant p53.	Alam SK, Yadav VK, Bajaj S, Datta A, Dutta SK, Bhattacharyya M, Bhattacharya S, Debnath S, Roy S, Boardman LA, Smyrk TC, Molina JR, Chakrabarti S, Chowdhury S, Mukhopadhyay D, Roychoudhury S.	Mutation in the TP53 gene positively correlates with increased incidence of chemoresistance in different cancers. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of chemoresistance and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in colorectal cancer involving the gain-of-function (GOF) mutant p53/ephrin-B2 signaling axis. Bioinformatic analysis of the NCI-60 data set and subsequent hub prediction identified EFNB2 as a possible GOF mutant p53 target gene, responsible for chemoresistance. We show that the mutant p53-NF-Y complex transcriptionally upregulates EFNB2 expression in response to DNA damage. Moreover, the acetylated form of mutant p53 protein is recruited on the EFNB2 promoter and positively regulates its expression in conjunction with coactivator p300. In vitro cell line and in vivo nude mice data show that EFNB2 silencing restores chemosensitivity in mutant p53-harboring tumors. In addition, we observed high expression of EFNB2 in patients having neoadjuvant non-responder colorectal carcinoma compared with those having responder version of the disease. In the course of deciphering the drug resistance mechanism, we also show that ephrin-B2 reverse signaling induces ABCG2 expression after drug treatment that involves JNK-c-Jun signaling in mutant p53 cells. Moreover, 5-fluorouracil-induced ephrin-B2 reverse signaling promotes tumorigenesis through the Src-ERK pathway, and drives EMT via the Src-FAK pathway. We thus conclude that targeting ephrin-B2 might enhance the therapeutic potential of DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents in mutant p53-bearing human tumors.Cell Death and Differentiation advance online publication, 23 October 2015; doi:10.1038/cdd.2015.133.
26174965	NUMB phosphorylation destabilizes p53 and promotes self-renewal of tumor-initiating cells by a NANOG-dependent mechanism in liver cancer.	Siddique HR, Feldman DE, Chen CL, Punj V, Tokumitsu H, Machida K.	Stem cell populations are maintained through self-renewing divisions in which one daughter cell commits to a particular fate whereas the other retains the multipotent characteristics of its parent. The NUMB, a tumor suppressor, in conjunction with another tumor-suppressor protein, p53, preserves this property and acts as a barrier against deregulated expansion of tumor-associated stem cells. In this context, NUMB-p53 interaction plays a crucial role to maintain the proper homeostasis of both stem cells, as well as differentiated cells. Because the molecular mechanism governing the assembly and stability of the NUMB-p53 interaction/complex are poorly understood, we tried to identify the molecule(s) that govern this process. Using cancer cell lines, tumor-initiating cells (TICs) of liver, the mouse model, and clinical samples, we identified that phosphorylations of NUMB destabilize p53 and promote self-renewal of TICs in a pluripotency-associated transcription factor NANOG-dependent manner. NANOG phosphorylates NUMB by atypical protein kinase C zeta (aPKCζ), through the direct induction of Aurora A kinase (AURKA) and the repression of an aPKCζ inhibitor, lethal (2) giant larvae. By radioactivity-based kinase activity assays, we showed that NANOG enhances kinase activities of both AURKA and aPKCζ, an important upstream process for NUMB phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of NUMB by aPKCζ destabilizes the NUMB-p53 interaction and p53 proteolysis and deregulates self-renewal in TICs.Post-translational modification of NUMB by the NANOG-AURKA-aPKCζ pathway is an important event in TIC self-renewal and tumorigenesis. Hence, the NANOG-NUMB-p53 signaling axis is an important regulatory pathway for TIC events in TIC self-renewal and liver tumorigenesis, suggesting a therapeutic strategy by targeting NUMB phosphorylation. Further in-depth in vivo and clinical studies are warranted to verify this suggestion. (Hepatology 2015;62:1466-1479).
25936916	An Apela RNA-Containing Negative Feedback Loop Regulates p53-Mediated Apoptosis in Embryonic Stem Cells.	Li M, Gou H, Tripathi BK, Huang J, Jiang S, Dubois W, Waybright T, Lei M, Shi J, Zhou M, Huang J.	Maintaining genomic integrity is of paramount importance to embryonic stem cells (ESCs), as mutations are readily propagated to daughter cells. ESCs display hypersensitivity to DNA damage-induced apoptosis (DIA) to prevent such propagation, although the molecular mechanisms underlying this apoptotic response are unclear. Here, we report that the regulatory RNA Apela positively regulates p53-mediated DIA. Apela is highly expressed in mouse ESCs and is repressed by p53 activation, and Apela depletion compromises p53-dependent DIA. Although Apela contains a coding region, this coding ability is dispensable for Apela's role in p53-mediated DIA. Instead, Apela functions as a regulatory RNA and interacts with hnRNPL, which prevents the mitochondrial localization and activation of p53. Together, these results describe a tri-element negative feedback loop composed of p53, Apela, and hnRNPL that regulates p53-mediated DIA, and they further demonstrate that regulatory RNAs add a layer of complexity to the apoptotic response of ESCs after DNA damage.
26521794	Caffeine Suppresses Apoptosis of Bladder Cancer RT4 Cells in Response to Ionizing Radiation by Inhibiting Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated-Chk2-p53 Axis.	Zhang ZW, Xiao J, Luo W, Wang BH, Chen JM.	Caffeine suppresses ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) activities; ATM is the major kinase for DNA damage detection. This study aimed to investigate the effects of caffeine on DNA damage responses in cells from the bladder cancer cell line RT4 those were exposed to ionizing radiation (IR).Immunofluorescent staining was performed to investigate changes in the proteins involved in DNA damage responses with or without caffeine. A mouse xenograft model was used to study the effects of caffeine on the DNA damage responses. Western blotting was used to investigate the effects of caffeine pretreatment on the ATM-Chk2-p53-Puma axis, while real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assessed changes in messenger RNA levels of p53 and downstream targets responding to IR. Finally, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-dUTP nick end labeling assay. Western blotting and colony formation assay were used to measure the effects of caffeine on radiation-related apoptosis. All of the data were analyzed with a two-tailed Student's t-test.Immunofluorescent staining showed that caffeine pretreatment profoundly suppressed the formation of γH2AXand p53-binding protein 1 foci in RT4 cells in response to irradiation. Cellular and animal experiments suggested that this suppression was mediated by suppression of the ATM-Chk2-p53-Puma DNA damage-signaling axis. RT-PCR indicated caffeine also attenuated transactivation of p53 and p53-inducible genes. The colony formation assay revealed that caffeine displayed radioprotective effects on RT4 cells in response to low-dose radiation compared to the radiosensitization effects on T24 cells.Caffeine may inhibit IR-related apoptosis of bladder cancer RT4 cells by suppressing activation of the ATM-Chk2-p53-Puma axis.
26350565	The cholesterol metabolite 27-hydroxycholesterol regulates p53 activity and increases cell proliferation via MDM2 in breast cancer cells.	Raza S, Ohm JE, Dhasarathy A, Schommer J, Roche C, Hammer KD, Ghribi O.	Estrogen is synthesized from cholesterol and high cholesterol levels are suggested to be associated with increased risk of estrogen receptor(ER)-positive breast cancer. The cholesterol metabolite 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) was recently identified as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and may therefore impact breast cancer progression. However, the mechanisms by which 27-OHC may contribute to breast cancer are not all known. We determined the extent to which 27-OHC regulates cell proliferation in MCF7 ER-positive breast cancer cell line involving the tumor suppressor protein p53. We found that treatment of MCF7 cells with 27-OHC resulted reduced p53 transcriptional activity. Conversely, treatment of the ER-negative MDA-MB 231 cells with 27-OHC induced no significant change in p53 activity. Exposure of MCF7 cells to 27-OHC was also associated with increased protein levels of the E3 ubiquitin protein ligase MDM2 and decreased levels of p53. Moreover, 27-OHC also enhanced physical interaction between p53 and MDM2. Furthermore, 27-OHC-induced proliferation was attenuated using either the p53 activator Tenovin-1 or the MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3 and Mdm2 siRNA. Taken together, our results indicate that 27-OHC may contribute to ER-positive breast cancer progression by disrupting constitutive p53 signaling in an MDM2-dependent manner.
25617798	Acute cytotoxicity of MIRA-1/NSC19630, a mutant p53-reactivating small molecule, against human normal and cancer cells via a caspase-9-dependent apoptosis.	Bou-Hanna C, Jarry A, Lode L, Schmitz I, Schulze-Osthoff K, Kury S, Bezieau S, Mosnier JF, Laboisse CL.	Although numerous studies have focused on the mechanisms of action of the candidate chemotherapeutic drug MIRA-1/NSC19630, initially described as a mutant p53-reactivating small molecule, the issue of its toxicological evaluation remains open. Here, we devised a strategy to examine the effects of MIRA-1 on a variety of human normal cells and cancer cell lines. First, we demonstrated a massive and rapid (within 2 hours) MIRA-1 apoptotic effect on human normal primary epithelial cells as shown using an intestinal mucosa explant assay. MIRA-1 was also cytotoxic to primary and subcultured human mesenchymal cells. Interestingly these effects were restricted to actively proliferating cells. Second, MIRA-1 acute toxicity was independent of p53, since it occurred in human normal cells with increased or silenced p53 expression level, in cancer cells derived from solid or liquid tumors, with either mutated or wt TP53, and in cancer cells devoid of p53. Third, combined pharmacological and genetic approaches showed that MIRA-1 acute cytotoxicity was mediated by a caspase-9-dependent apoptosis. In conclusion, our strategy unveils the limitations of the targeted action of a small molecule designed to reactivate mutant p53.
26060045	Determination of HER2 and p53 Mutations by Sequence Analysis Method and EGFR/Chromosome 7 Gene Status by Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization for the Predilection of Targeted Therapy Modalities in Immunohistochemically Triple Negative Breast Carcinomas in Turkish Population.	Pala EE, Bayol U, Keskin EU, Ozguzer A, Kucuk U, Ozer O, Koc A.	Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), an agressive subtype accounts nearly 15 % of all breast carcinomas. Conventional chemotherapy is the only treatment modality thus new, effective targeted therapy methods have been investigated. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors give hope according to the recent studies results. Also therapeutic agents have been tried against aberrant p53 signal activity as TNBC show high p53 mutation rates. Our aim was to detect the incidence of mutations/amplifications identified in TNBC in our population. Here we used sequence analysis to detect HER2 (exon 18-23), p53 (exon 5-8) mutations; fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method to analyse EGFR/chromosome 7 centromere gene status in 82 immunohistochemically TNBC. Basaloid phenotype was identified in 49 (59.8 %) patients. EGFR amplification was noted in 5 cases (6.1 %). All EGFR amplified cases showed EGFR overexpression by immunohistochemistry (IHC). p53 mutations were identified in 33 (40.2 %) cases. Almost 60 % of the basal like breast cancer cases showed p53 mutation. Only one case showed HER2 mutation (exon 20:g.36830_3). Our results showed that gene amplification is not the unique mechanism in EGFR overexpression. IHC might be used in the decision of anti-EGFR therapy in routine practice. p53 mutation rate was lower than the rates reported in the literature probably due to ethnic differences and low sensitivity of sanger sequences in general mutation screening. We also established the rarity of HER2 mutation in TNBC. In conclusion EGFR and p53 are the major targets in TNBC also for our population.
25683911	Chk1 and Wee1 control genotoxic-stress induced G2-M arrest in melanoma cells.	Vera J, Raatz Y, Wolkenhauer O, Kottek T, Bhattacharya A, Simon JC, Kunz M.	In the present report, the role of ATR-Chk1-Wee1 and ATM-Chk2-p53-p21 pathways in stress-induced cell cycle control is analysed in melanoma cells. Treatment of p53 wild-type melanoma cells with the genotoxic agent doxorubicin induces G2-M arrest, inhibitory phosphorylation of cell cycle kinase Cdc2 (CDK1) and enhanced expression of p53/p21. Wee1 inhibition under doxorubicin pulse-treatment reduces G2-M arrest and induces apoptosis. Inhibition of upstream kinase Chk1 under doxorubicin treatment almost completely abolishes stress-induced G2-M arrest and induces enhanced apoptosis. Interestingly, Chk1 inhibition alone even further increases apoptosis. While Chk1 inhibition alone almost completely abolishes G0-G1 arrest, combined treatment with doxorubicin re-establishes G0-G1 arrest. Moreover, Chk1 inhibition alone induces only a slight p53/p21 induction, while a strong induction of both proteins is observed by the combination with doxorubicin. These findings are suggestive for a particular role of p53/p21 in G0-G1, and Chk1 in G0-G1 and G2-M arrest. In line with this, the p53-mutant SK-Mel-28 melanoma cells do not mount a significant G0-G1 arrest under combined doxorubicin and Chk1 inhibitor treatment but rather show extensive apoptosis. Moreover, knockdown of p21 dramatically reduces stress-induced G0-G1 arrest under doxorubicin and Chk1 inhibitor treatment accompanied by massive DNA damage and apoptosis induction. Treatment of melanoma cells with an inhibitor of Chk2 upstream kinase ATM and doxorubicin almost completely abolishes G0-G1 arrest. Taken together, both Chk1 and Wee1 are mediators of G2-M arrest, while p53, p21 and Chk1 are mediators of G0-G1 arrest in melanoma cells. Combined treatment with chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin and Chk1 inhibitors may help to overcome apoptosis resistance of p53-proficient melanoma cells. But treatment with Chk1 inhibitor alone may even be more efficient.
25700283	p53 and ΔNp63α Coregulate the Transcriptional and Cellular Response to TGFβ and BMP Signals.	Balboni AL, Cherukuri P, Ung M, DeCastro AJ, Cheng C, DiRenzo J.	The TGFβ superfamily regulates a broad range of cellular processes, including proliferation, cell-fate specification, differentiation, and migration. Molecular mechanisms underlying this high degree of pleiotropy and cell-type specificity are not well understood. The TGFβ family is composed of two branches: (i) TGFβs, activins, and nodals, which signal through SMAD2/3, and (ii) bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), which signal through SMAD1/5/8. SMADs have weak DNA-binding affinity and rely on coactivators and corepressors to specify their transcriptional outputs. This report reveals that p53 and ΔNp63α act as transcriptional partners for SMAD proteins and thereby influence cellular responses to TGFβ and BMPs. Suppression of p53 or overexpression of ΔNp63α synergistically enhance BMP-induced transcription. Mechanistically, p53 and ΔNp63α physically interact with SMAD1/5/8 proteins and co-occupy the promoter region of inhibitor of differentiation (ID2), a prosurvival BMP target gene. Demonstrating further convergence of these pathways, TGFβ-induced canonical BMP regulated transcription in a ΔNp63α- and p53-dependent manner. Furthermore, bioinformatic analyses revealed that SMAD2/3 and ΔNp63α coregulate a significant number of transcripts involved in the regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Thus, p53 and ΔNp63α are transcriptional partners for a subset of TGFβ- and BMP-regulated SMAD target genes in the mammary epithelium. Collectively, these results establish an integrated gene network of SMADs, p53, and ΔNp63α that contribute to EMT and metastasis.This study identifies aberrant BMP activation as a result of p53 mutation or ΔNp63α expression.
26408616	[Expression of PTEN, p53 and EGFR in the molecular subtypes of breast carcinoma and  the correlation among them].	Li X, Wang Q, Fu L, Liu M, Yu X.	To study the expression of PTEN, p53 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in the molecular subtypes of breast carcinoma and to evaluate the correlations with triple-negative breast cancer. Immunohistochemical MaxVision(TM) method was used to detect the expression of PTEN, p53, EGFR, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in 291 cases of infiltrating ductal carcinoma of breast.  The positive expression of PTEN, p53 and EGFR protein in breast carcinoma was 57.0%, 57.0% and 38.5%, respectively, which were significantly different from those in benign breast diseases (P<0.05). The expression of PTEN or EGFR in breast cancer was correlated with tumor size, histological grade, lymph node metastasis, TNM stage, ER and HER2 status (P<0.05); the expression of p53 was correlated with tumor size, histological grade and ER status (P<0.05). The difference of positive expression rates of PTEN, p53 and EGFR protein among different subtypes including luminal A, luminal B (HER2-), luminal B (HER2+), HER2 over-expression and triple-negative was statistically significant (P<0.05). There were close correlations among PTEN, p53 and EGFR in the triple-negative subtype (P<0.05). Low expression of PTEN and high expression of EGFR and p53 are observed in triple-negative breast cancer, which may synergistically contribute to the pathogenesis of triple-negative breast cancer.
26434550	Dual display bacteriophage as a platform for high sensitive detection of serum p53 antibodies in breast cancer patients.	Pan PT, Zou FY, Mao XF, Cao DH, Wei SL, Gao X, Wang L.	BACKGROUND: Serum autoantibodies are rapidly becoming interesting targets because of their biological and medical relevance. Conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) mostly used recombinant protein as an antigen to detect autoantibodies. However, acquiring high purity of recombinant protein was time-consuming and laborious. The aim of this study was to increase the detection efficiency of serum p53 antibodies (Abs), a prognostic indicator in breast cancer as well as a biomarker in the early stages of cancers, via using a new type of dual display phage. METHODS: A novel dual display phage and 3 types of single display phage were prepared via phage display technology. Recombinant p53 protein was used as control. Serum of p53 Abs in 122 female patients diagnosed with primary breast cancer was detected by all the antigens mentioned above. RESULTS: Both pIII and pVIII proteins of bacteriophage could be used for the detection of serum p53 Abs. Compared with recombinant p53 protein and the other 3 types of single display phages, the dual display phage showed a higher detection efficiency of p53 Abs in patients of breast cancer. CONCLUSION: This inexpensive and sensitive dual display phage paves the way to the wide range usage of antibody biomarkers in other immune illnesses and has the potential to develop into a new type of diagnosis reagent.
25602147	A delay prior to mitotic entry triggers caspase 8-dependent cell death in p53-deficient Hela and HCT-116 cells.	Silva VC, Plooster M, Leung JC, Cassimeris L.	Stathmin/Oncoprotein 18, a microtubule destabilizing protein, is required for survival of p53-deficient cells. Stathmin-depleted cells are slower to enter mitosis, but whether delayed mitotic entry triggers cell death or whether stathmin has a separate pro-survival function was unknown. To test these possibilities, we abrogated the cell cycle delay by inhibiting Wee1 in synchronized, stathmin-depleted cells and found that apoptosis was reduced to control levels. Synchronized cells treated with a 4 hour pulse of inhibitors to CDK1 or both Aurora A and PLK1 delayed mitotic entry and apoptosis was triggered only in p53-deficient cells. We did not detect mitotic defects downstream of the delayed mitotic entry, indicating that cell death is activated by a mechanism distinct from those activated by prolonged mitotic arrest. Cell death is triggered by initiator caspase 8, based on its cleavage to the active form and by rescue of viability after caspase 8 depletion or treatment with a caspase 8 inhibitor. In contrast, initiator caspase 9, activated by prolonged mitotic arrest, is not activated and is not required for apoptosis under our experimental conditions. P53 upregulates expression of cFLIPL, a protein that blocks caspase 8 activation. cFLIPL levels are lower in cells lacking p53 and these levels are reduced to a greater extent after stathmin depletion. Expression of FLAG-tagged cFLIPL in p53-deficient cells rescues them from apoptosis triggered by stathmin depletion or CDK1 inhibition during G2. These data indicate that a cell cycle delay in G2 activates caspase 8 to initiate apoptosis specifically in p53-deficient cells.
26539911	Transcriptional repression of cancer stem cell marker CD133 by tumor suppressor p53.	Park EK, Lee JC, Park JW, Bang SY, Yi SA, Kim BK, Park JH, Kwon SH, You JS, Nam SW, Cho EJ, Han JW.	Novel therapeutic strategies are needed to overcome cancer recurrence, metastasis, and resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are major contributors to the malignant transformation of cells due to their capacity for self-renewal. Although various CSC markers have been identified in several types of tumors, they are primarily used as cancer-prediction markers and for the isolation of CSC populations. CD133, one of the best-characterized CSC markers in distinct solid tumor types, was shown to be correlated with CSC tumor-initiating capacity; however, the regulation of CD133 expression and its function in cancer are poorly understood. Here, we show that CD133 expression is negatively regulated by direct binding of the p53 tumor suppressor protein to a noncanonical p53-binding sequence in the CD133 promoter. Binding of p53 recruits Histone Deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to the CD133 promoter and subsequently suppresses CD133 expression by reducing histone H3 acetylation. Furthermore, CD133 depletion suppresses tumor cell proliferation, colony formation, and the expression of core stemness transcription factors including NANOG, octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4), SOX2, and c-MYC. Critically, the anti-proliferative effects of p53 are antagonized by rescue of CD133 expression in a p53 overexpressing cell line, indicating that the tumor suppressive activity of p53 might be mediated by CD133 suppression. Taken together, our results suggest that p53-mediated transcriptional regulation of CD133 is a key underlying mechanism for controlling the growth and tumor-initiating capacity of CSCs and provide a novel perspective on targeting CSCs for cancer therapy.
26400164	LRH-1 drives colon cancer cell growth by repressing the expression of the CDKN1A gene in a p53-dependent manner.	Kramer HB, Lai CF, Patel H, Periyasamy M, Lin ML, Feller SM, Fuller-Pace FV, Meek DW, Ali S, Buluwela L.	Liver receptor homologue 1 (LRH-1) is an orphan nuclear receptor that has been implicated in the progression of breast, pancreatic and colorectal cancer (CRC). To determine mechanisms underlying growth promotion by LRH-1 in CRC, we undertook global expression profiling following siRNA-mediated LRH-1 knockdown in HCT116 cells, which require LRH-1 for growth and in HT29 cells, in which LRH-1 does not regulate growth. Interestingly, expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 (CDKN1A) was regulated by LRH-1 in HCT116 cells. p21 regulation was not observed in HT29 cells, where p53 is mutated. p53 dependence for the regulation of p21 by LRH-1 was confirmed by p53 knockdown with siRNA, while LRH-1-regulation of p21 was not evident in HCT116 cells where p53 had been deleted. We demonstrate that LRH-1-mediated p21 regulation in HCT116 cells does not involve altered p53 protein or phosphorylation, and we show that LRH-1 inhibits p53 recruitment to the p21 promoter, likely through a mechanism involving chromatin remodelling. Our study suggests an important role for LRH-1 in the growth of CRC cells that retain wild-type p53.
25395275	Taurine induces the apoptosis of breast cancer cells by regulating apoptosis-related proteins of mitochondria.	Zhang X, Lu H, Wang Y, Liu C, Zhu W, Zheng S, Wan F.	Taurine (Tau), the most abundant free amino acid in humans has numerous potential health benefits through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, limited studies have assessed its effect on tumors and the antitumor mechanism remains unknown. The present study investigated the cellular and molecular changes induced by Tau, leading to the induction of apoptosis in human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. MCF-7 is p53 proﬁcient (p53+/+) and MDA-MB-231 is a p53 null mutant (p53-/-). Cell proliferation and viability were assessed by MTT. Flow cytometry and hoechst33342 fluorescent staining were employed to detect apoptosis. Spectrophotometry was used to detect caspase-3 activity. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were used to detect the levels of mRNA and proteins of p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), Bax and Bcl-2. Finally, the affect of Tau on the growth of MDA-MB-231-cell-nude mice xenografts was examined. In the study, Tau inhibited growth and induced apoptosis of the two cell lines in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Notably, the inhibitory effect of Tau on p53-/- cancer cells was clearly significant compared to the p53+/+ cancer cells. Further studies showed that Tau promoted apoptosis in human breast cancer cells and inhibited the growth of tumor in nude mice by inducing the expression of PUMA, which further up- and downregulated the expression of Bax and Bcl-2 protein, giving rise to increased activation of caspase-3. Collectively, these results indicate that Tau is a potent candidate for the chemotherapy of breast cancer through increasing the PUMA expression independent of p53 status.
25414256	p53 protein-mediated up-regulation of MAP kinase phosphatase 3 (MKP-3) contributes to the establishment of the cellular senescent phenotype through dephosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2).	Zhang H, Chi Y, Gao K, Zhang X, Yao J.	Growth arrest is one of the essential features of cellular senescence. At present, the precise mechanisms responsible for the establishment of the senescence-associated arrested phenotype are still incompletely understood. Given that ERK1/2 is one of the major kinases controlling cell growth and proliferation, we examined the possible implication of ERK1/2. Exposure of normal rat epithelial cells to etoposide caused cellular senescence, as manifested by enlarged cell size, a flattened cell body, reduced cell proliferation, enhanced β-galactosidase activity, and elevated p53 and p21. Senescent cells displayed a blunted response to growth factor-induced cell proliferation, which was preceded by impaired ERK1/2 activation. Further analysis revealed that senescent cells expressed a significantly higher level of mitogen-activated protein phosphatase 3 (MKP-3, a cytosolic ERK1/2-targeted phosphatase), which was suppressed by blocking the transcriptional activity of the tumor suppressor p53 with pifithrin-α. Inhibition of MKP-3 activity with a specific inhibitor or siRNA enhanced basal ERK1/2 phosphorylation and promoted cell proliferation. Apart from its role in growth arrest, impairment of ERK1/2 also contributed to the resistance of senescent cells to oxidant-elicited cell injury. These results therefore indicate that p53-mediated up-regulation of MKP-3 contributes to the establishment of the senescent cellular phenotype through dephosphorylating ERK1/2. Impairment of ERK1/2 activation could be an important mechanism by which p53 controls cellular senescence.
25367309	ATP-citrate lyase regulates cellular senescence via an AMPK- and p53-dependent pathway.	Lee JH, Jang H, Lee SM, Lee JE, Choi J, Kim TW, Cho EJ, Youn HD.	ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) is a key enzyme that is involved in de novo lipogenesis by catalyzing conversion of cytosolic citrate into acetyl CoA and oxaloacetate. Up-regulation of ACLY in various types of tumors enhances fatty acid synthesis and supplies excess acetyl CoA for histone acetylation. However, there is evidence that its enzymatic activity alone is insufficient to explain ACLY silencing-mediated growth arrest in tumor cells. In this study, we found that ACLY knockdown in primary human cells triggers cellular senescence and activation of tumor suppressor p53. Provision of acetyl CoA to ACLY knockdown cells did not alleviate ACLY silencing-induced p53 activation, suggesting an independent role for ACLY activity. Instead, ACLY physically interacted with the catalytic subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibited AMPK activity. The activation of AMPK under ACLY knockdown conditions may lead to p53 activation, ultimately leading to cellular senescence. In cancer cells, ACLY silencing-induced p53 activation facilitated DNA damage-induced cell death. Taken together, our results suggest a novel function of ACLY in cellular senescence and tumorigenesis.
25480405	Helicobacter pylori Infection Activates the Akt-Mdm2-p53 Signaling Pathway in Gastric Epithelial Cells.	Shu X, Yang Z, Li ZH, Chen L, Zhou XD, Xie Y, Lu NH.	BACKGROUNDS AND AIMS: Although Helicobacter pylori is widely accepted as a causative factor of many gastric diseases, the signaling pathways affected by H. pylori and subsequent effects on cell apoptosis and proliferation remain unclear. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms mediating H. pylori infection in gastric epithelial cells. METHODS: Tissues from 160 patients with various gastric diseases with or without H. pylori infection were obtained and analyzed by immunohistochemistry for Akt, pAkt, Mdm2, p53, and Bax expression. In vitro, human gastric epithelial cells, GES-1, were incubated with H. pylori culture filtrates. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Apoptosis was evaluated by Annexin V/PI double staining followed by flow cytometry, DNA electrophoresis, and comet assay. mRNA and protein expression was assessed by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: In patient tissues, H. pylori infection was associated with significantly elevated levels of pAkt in chronic nonatrophic gastritis (CNAG), Mdm2 in dysplasia, p53 in metaplastic atrophy (MA), and Bax in CNAG and MA. In vitro, H. pylori culture filtrates reduced GES-1 cell viability in a time- and dose-dependent manner, induced G0/G1 arrest, triggered apoptosis, and increased DNA fragmentation. Mdm2 and Bax mRNA expression and pAkt, Mdm2, p53, and Bax protein expression were significantly upregulated when treated with H. pylori culture filtrates. Akt inhibition by LY294002 decreased Mdm2 expression, upregulated p53, and enhanced H. pylori-induced growth inhibition of GES-1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that Akt-Mdm2-p53 signaling is involved in the molecular response of GES-1 cells to H. pylori infection.
25544708	Correlation between squamous cell carcinoma of the lung and human papillomavirus infection and the relationship to expression of p53 and p16.	Fan X, Yu K, Wu J, Shao J, Zhu L, Zhang J.	The number of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients reported as infected with human papillomavirus (HPV) varies among countries and by race and geographical location. Furthermore, the relationship between HPV and the expressions of p53 and p16 remains unclear. A large cohort of NSCLC patients from Shanghai was studied. Paraffin sections from 128 cases of lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) and 134 cases of squamous cell carcinoma (SQC) were collected from the Shanghai Chest Hospital. Samples were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse dot blot for detection of HPV DNA and by immunohistochemistry for detection of p53 and p16 expressions. The rate of HPV infection in SQC cases was significantly higher than in ADC cases (12.69 versus 3.91%). Females with SQC had a significantly higher rate of HPV infection compared to males with SQC (18.75 versus 7.14%, p = 0.044). HPV infection was correlated with gender and age in SQC but not with the degree of tumor differentiation, TNM stage, or smoking. Koilocytosis was significantly correlated to the tumor differentiation grade, regardless of age and TNM stage. The expressions of p53 and p16 were correlated with HPV infection and the tumor histological type but not with the degree of tumor differentiation, TNM stage, smoking, gender, or age. p53-positive expression was significantly higher in HPV-infected SQC cases than in those not infected with HPV. There was no statistically significant difference in the expression of p16 between the two groups. Data showed that HPV infection may be an important virulence factor in SQC, particularly in female patients. HPV infection appears to be involved in cancer progression in SQC by promoting the expression of p53; however, p16 cannot be used as a surrogate marker for HPV infection in SQC.
25196217	BIRC6 promotes hepatocellular carcinogenesis: interaction of BIRC6 with p53 facilitating p53 degradation.	Tang W, Xue R, Weng S, Wu J, Fang Y, Wang Y, Ji L, Hu T, Liu T, Huang X, Chen S, Shen X, Zhang S, Dong L.	The genes that encode inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) are frequently overexpressed in human cancers. However, the expression pattern and clinical significance of BIRC6, a member of IAPs, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Here we investigated the role of BIRC6 in hepatocellular carcinogenesis. We used immunoblot and immunochemical analyses to determine the levels of BIRC6 in 7 hepatoma cell lines and 160 HCC specimens. We evaluated the proognostic value of BIRC6 expression and its association with clinical parameters. A lentivirus-mediated silencing method was used to knockdown BIRC6, and the biological consequences of BIRC6 silencing in three hepatoma cell lines were investigated in vitro and in vivo. We found that BIRC6 overexpression was significantly correlated with serum ALT level and HCC vascular invasion. Patients with positive BIRC6 expression in tumor tissue had a poor survival and a high rate of recurrence. BIRC6 knockdown remarkably suppressed cell proliferation, caused G1/S arrest and sensitized hepatoma cells to sorafenib-induced apoptosis in hepatoma cells, which was partly reversed by RNA interference targeting p53. The mechanistic study revealed that BIRC6 interacted with p53 and facilitated its degradation. The in vivo study showed that BIRC6 knockdown inhibited xenograft tumor growth and increased the sensitivity of tumor cells to sorafenib in nude mice. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that BIRC6 overexpression in HCC specimens is indicative of poor prognosis and that its interaction with p53 facilitates the degradation of p53, leading to carcinogenesis and an anti-apoptotic status.
26386653	Mechanisms involved in p53 downregulation by leptin in trophoblastic cells.	Toro AR, Pérez-Pérez A, Corrales Gutiérrez I, Sánchez-Margalet V, Varone CL.	Leptin, a 16-kDa polypeptide hormone, is produced by the adipocyte and can also be synthesized by placenta. We previously demonstrated that leptin promotes proliferation and survival in placenta, in part mediated by the p53 pathway. In this work, we investigated the mechanisms involved in leptin down-regulation of p53 level. The human first trimester cytotrophoblastic Swan-71 cell line and human placental explants at term were used. In order to study the late phase of apoptosis, triggered by serum deprivation, experiments of DNA fragmentation were carried out. Exogenous leptin added to human placental explants, showed a decrease on DNA ladder formation and MAPK pathway is involved in this leptin effect. We also found that under serum deprivation condition, leptin decreases p53 levels and the inhibitory leptin effect is lost when cells were pretreated with 50 μM PD98059 or 10 μM LY29004; or were transfected with dominant negative mutants of intermediates of these pathways, suggesting that MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways are necessaries for leptin action. Additionally, leptin diminished Ser-46 p53 phosphorylation and this effect in placental explants was mediated by the activation of MAPK and PI3K pathways. Finally, in order to assess leptin effect on p53 half-life experiments with cycloheximide were performed and MDM-2 expression was analyzed. Leptin diminished p53 half-life and up-regulated MDM-2 expression. In summary, we provided evidence suggesting that leptin anti-apoptotic effect is mediated by MAPK and PI3K pathways.
25472962	Effect of p53 on mitochondrial morphology, import, and assembly in skeletal muscle.	Saleem A, Iqbal S, Zhang Y, Hood DA.	The purpose of this study was to investigate whether p53 regulates mitochondrial function via changes in mitochondrial protein import, complex IV (COX) assembly, or the expression of key proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics and degradation. Mitochondria from p53 KO mice displayed ultra-structural alterations and were more punctate in appearance. This was accompanied by protein-specific alterations in fission, fusion, and mitophagy-related proteins. However, matrix-destined protein import into subsarcolemmal or intermyofibrillar mitochondria was unaffected in the absence of p53, despite mitochondrial subfraction-specific reductions in Tom20, Tim23, mtHsp70, and mtHsp60 in the knockout (KO) mitochondria. Complex IV activity in isolated mitochondria was also unchanged in KO mice, but two-dimensional blue native-PAGE revealed a reduction in the assembly of complex IV within the IMF fractions from KO mice in tandem with lower levels of the assembly protein Surf1. This observed defect in complex IV assembly may facilitate the previously documented impairment in mitochondrial function in p53 KO mice. We suspect that these morphological and functional impairments in mitochondria drive a decreased reliance on mitochondrial respiration as a means of energy production in skeletal muscle in the absence of p53.
25649770	Interaction between p53 mutation and a somatic HDMX biomarker better defines metastatic potential in breast cancer.	Grawenda AM, Møller EK, Lam S, Repapi E, Teunisse AF, Alnæs GI, Børresen-Dale AL, Kristensen VN, Goding CR, Jochemsen AG, Edvardsen H, Bond GL.	TP53 gene mutation is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer, but additional biomarkers that can further refine the impact of the p53 pathway are needed to achieve clinical utility. In this study, we evaluated a role for the HDMX-S/FL ratio as one such biomarker, based on its association with other suppressor mutations that confer worse prognosis in sarcomas, another type of cancer that is surveilled by p53. We found that HDMX-S/FL ratio interacted with p53 mutational status to significantly improve prognostic capability in patients with breast cancer. This biomarker pair offered prognostic utility that was comparable with a microarray-based prognostic assay. Unexpectedly, the utility tracked independently of DNA-damaging treatments and instead with different tumor metastasis potential. Finally, we obtained evidence that this biomarker pair might identify patients who could benefit from anti-HDM2 strategies to impede metastatic progression. Taken together, our work offers a p53 pathway marker, which both refines our understanding of the impact of p53 activity on prognosis and harbors potential utility as a clinical tool.
25528982	Modulation of p53 and met expression by Kruppel-like factor 8 regulates zebrafish cerebellar development.	Tsai MY, Lu YF, Liu YH, Lien HW, Huang CJ, Wu JL, Hwang SP.	Krüppel-like factor 8 (Klf8) is a zinc-finger transcription factor implicated in cell proliferation, and cancer cell survival and invasion; however, little is known about its role in normal embryonic development. Here, we show that Klf8 is required for normal cerebellar development in zebrafish embryos. Morpholino knockdown of klf8 resulted in abnormal cerebellar primordium morphology and the induction of p53 in the brain region at 24 hours post-fertilization (hpf). Both p53-dependent reduction of cell proliferation and augmentation of apoptosis were observed in the cerebellar anlage of 24 hpf-klf8 morphants. In klf8 morphants, expression of ptf1a in the ventricular zone was decreased from 48 to 72 hpf; on the other hand, expression of atohla in the upper rhombic lip was unaffected. Consistent with this finding, Purkinje cell development was perturbed and granule cell number was reduced in 72 hpf-klf8 morphants; co-injection of p53 MO(sp) or klf8 mRNA substantially rescued development of cerebellar Purkinje cells in klf8 morphants. Hepatocyte growth factor/Met signaling is known to regulate cerebellar development in zebrafish and mouse. We observed decreased met expression in the tectum and rhombomere 1 of 24 hpf-klf8 morphants, which was largely rescued by co-injection with klf8 mRNA. Moreover, co-injection of met mRNA substantially rescued formation of Purkinje cells in klf8 morphants at 72 hpf. Together, these results demonstrate that Klf8 modulates expression of p53 and met to maintain ptf1a-expressing neuronal progenitors, which are required for the appropriate development of cerebellar Purkinje and granule cells in zebrafish embryos.
26171917	Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Vulva: A Subclassification of 97 Cases by Clinicopathologic, Immunohistochemical, and Molecular Features (p16, p53, and EGFR).	Dong F, Kojiro S, Borger DR, Growdon WB, Oliva E.	Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the vulva develop through human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated or HPV-independent pathways, but the relationship between pathogenesis, classification, and prognosis of these tumors is controversial. Therefore, we review the morphology, immunophenotype, and select molecular features of a consecutive series of 97 patients with vulvar SCC with a median clinical follow-up of 3.6 years. Tumors were histologically classified as basaloid (13), warty (11), mixed basaloid and warty (1), keratinizing (68), nonkeratinizing (3), and sarcomatoid (1). Diffuse p16 expression was associated with younger age at presentation (P<0.0001), basaloid and warty carcinoma subtypes (P<0.0001), and usual vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (P<0.0001) and was negatively associated with p53 immunopositivity (P=0.0008). Five keratinizing SCCs showed p16 and p53 coexpression, but only 1 was positive for high-risk HPV by in situ hybridization. Among 8 of 36 tumors with EGFR gene amplification, 4 were p53 positive but none p16 positive. In a Cox regression model, early clinical stage (P<0.006), p16 expression (P=0.002), and absent p53 expression (P=0.02) were independent predictors of improved overall survival. These findings utilize morphologic and immunohistochemical analysis to support HPV-associated and HPV-independent pathogenesis of vulvar SCCs and support p16 and p53 immunohistochemistry as markers of disease biology and clinical outcome.
25028191	Expression of vimentin and survivin in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and correlation with p53.	Shi ZG, Li SQ, Li ZJ, Zhu XJ, Xu P, Liu G.	PURPOSE: This study focuses on investigating the expression correlation of vimentin, survivin and p53 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and the clinical significance. METHODS: The mRNA and protein expression levels of the vimentin, survivin and p53 were determined in ccRCC and adjacent normal renal tissues, using quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. We detected the expression and localization of vimentin, survivin and p53 protein in ccRCC by immunohistochemistrical SP method and analyzed the relationships among clinical pathologic parameters and patient prognosis. RESULTS: The expression of vimentin and survivin was significantly increased in ccRCC compared with adjacent normal renal tissues, which were positively correlated with the pathological grade and clinical stage (P < 0.05). p53 was highly expressed in ccRCC compared with normal tissues (P < 0.05), which was not positively correlated with the pathological grade and clinical stage (P > 0.05). Furthermore, univariate and multivariate analysis showed that high expression levels of vimentin and survivin were independent prognostic indicators for ccRCC. The levels of vimentin and survivin were positively correlated in ccRCC (r = 0.428, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Reliable basis about biological behavior and prognosis judgments of ccRCC can be provided by combining detection of vimentin and survivin. Foundation and new ideas for gene therapy of ccRCC may be provided by further studying the relationship among vimentin, survivin and p53 in ccRCC.
24837741	Benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide induced p53-independent necrosis via the mitochondria-associated pathway involving Bax and Bak activation.	Zhang W, Liu N, Wang X, Jin X, Du H, Peng G, Xue J.	Benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE) is a highly reactive DNA damage agent and can induce cell death through both p53-independent and -dependent pathways. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of p53-independent pathways in BPDE-induced cell death. To understand the p53-independent mechanisms, we have now examined BPDE-induced cytotoxicity in p53-deficient baby mouse kidney (BMK) cells. The results showed that BPDE could induce Bax and Bak activation, cytochrome c release, caspases activation, and necrotic cell death in the BMK cells. Bax and Bak, two key molecules of mitochondrial permeability transition pore, were interdependently activated by BPDE, with Bax and Bak translocation to and Bax/Bak homo-oligomerization in mitochondria, release of cytochrome c was induced. Importantly, cytochrome c release and necrotic cell death were diminished in BMK cells (Bax(-/-)), BMK cells (Bak(-/-)), and BMK cells (Bax(-/-)/Bak(-/-)). Furthermore, overexpression of Bcl-2 could ameliorate BPDE-induced cytochrome c release and necrosis. Together the findings suggested that BPDE-induced necrosis was modulated by the p53-independent pathway, which was related to the translocation of Bax and Bak to mitochondria, release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspases.
24706461	Mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate induces apoptosis in p53-silenced L02 cells via activation of both mitochondrial and death receptor pathways.	Yang G, Zhang W, Qin Q, Wang J, Zheng H, Xiong W, Yuan J.	Mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) is one of the main metabolites of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate. The evidence shows that DEHP may exert its toxic effects primarily via MEHP, which is 10-fold more potent than its parent compound in toxicity in vitro. MEHP-induced apoptosis is mediated by either p53-dependent or -independent pathway. However, the detailed mechanism of its toxicity remains unclear. In this study, immortalized normal human liver cell line L02 was chosen, as an in vitro model of nonmalignant liver, to elucidate the role of p53 in MEHP-induced apoptosis. The cells were treated with MEHP (6.25, 12.50, 25.00, 50.00, and 100.00 μM) for 24 and 36 h, then small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to specifically silence p53 gene of L02 cells. The results indicated that MEHP caused oxidative DNA damage and apoptosis in L02 cells were associated with the p53 signaling pathway. Further study found that MEHP (50.00 and 100.00 μM) induced apoptosis in p53-silenced L02 cells, along with the up-regulations of Fas and FasL proteins as well as increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and Caspase 3, 8, and 9 activities. Additionally, both FasL inhibitor (AF-016) and Caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp- fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-FMK) could prevent the cell apoptosis induced by MEHP. The findings suggested that MEHP-induced apoptosis in L02 cells involving a Caspases-mediated mitochondrial signaling pathway and/or death receptor pathway. p53 was not absolutely necessary for MEHP-induced L02 cell apoptosis.
25310623	5‑FU resistance abrogates the amplified cytotoxic effects induced by inhibiting checkpoint kinase 1 in p53‑mutated colon cancer cells.	Akasaka T, Tsujii M, Kondo J, Hayashi Y, Ying J, Lu Y, Kato M, Yamada T, Yamamoto S, Inoue T, Tsujii Y, Maekawa A, Fujinaga T, Shiraishi E, Hiyama S, Inoue T, Shinzaki S, Watabe K, Nishida T, Iijima H, Takehara T.	The emergence of chemoresistance is a major limitation of current cancer therapies, and checkpoint kinase (Chk1) 1 positively correlates with resistance to chemo‑ or radio‑therapy. Cancer cells lacking p53 pathways are completely dependent on the S and G2/M checkpoints via Chk1; therefore, Chk1 inhibition enhances the cytotoxicity of DNA‑damaging agents only in p53‑deficient cells. However, little is known about the synergistic effect of Chk1 inhibition with 5‑FU, the most frequently used antimetabolite, in chemoresistant colorectal cells. In this study, we found that 5‑FU induced S‑phase arrest only in p53‑deficient colorectal cancer cells. 5‑FU treatment induced DNA damage and activation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and Chk1, leading to S‑phase arrest, and Chk1 inhibition using SB218078 reduced S‑phase arrest and increased apoptosis in the presence of 5‑FU. In contrast, in p53‑deficient, 5‑FU‑resistant (5FUR) colon cancer cells that we developed, 5‑FU enhanced DNA damage but did not induce Chk1/ATM activation or cell cycle arrest. SB218078 in combination with 5‑FU did not induce apoptosis. These results indicate that 5‑FU‑resistance abrogated the anticancer effect amplified by Chk1 inhibition, even in p53‑deficient cancer cells.
26578773	PML IV/ARF interaction enhances p53 SUMO-1 conjugation, activation, and senescence.	Ivanschitz L, Takahashi Y, Jollivet F, Ayrault O, Le Bras M, de Thé H.	Promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs) recruit multiple partners, including p53 and many of its regulators. NBs are believed to facilitate several posttranslational modifications and are key regulators of senescence. PML, the organizer of NBs, is expressed as a number of splice variants that all efficiently recruit p53 partners. However, overexpression of only one of them, PML IV, triggers p53-driven senescence. Here, we show that PML IV specifically binds ARF, a key p53 regulator. Similar to ARF, PML IV enhances global SUMO-1 conjugation, particularly that of p53, resulting in p53 stabilization and activation. ARF interacts with and stabilizes the NB-associated UBC9 SUMO-conjugating enzyme, possibly explaining PML IV-enhanced SUMOylation. These results unexpectedly link two key tumor suppressors, highlighting their convergence for global control of SUMO conjugation, p53 activation, and senescence induction.
26206128	Gene-modified embryonic stem cell test to characterize chemical risks.	Kitada K, Kizu A, Teramura T, Takehara T, Hayashi M, Tachibana D, Wanibuchi H, Fukushima S, Koyama M, Yoshida K, Morita T.	A high-throughput test of cell growth inhibition was performed using mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells to assess chemical toxicities. We herein demonstrated using a 96-well culture plate approach and the MTT assay that this method was suitable for prioritization of chemicals for their cytotoxic properties. In order to categorize chemicals, we used p53 gene-modified mouse ES cells as well as wild-type ES cells. The p53 gene is a well-known tumor suppressor and controls programmed cell death (apoptosis) and cellular senescence that is triggered by DNA-damaging agents such as alkylating agents and radiation. In the present study, p53-deficient ES cells were found to be more resistant to a tumor initiator, diethylnitrosamine (DEN), than wild-type ES cells, suggesting the inhibition of apoptosis or senescence by a dysfunction in p53. Chromosome aberrations were more frequently detected in p53-deficient ES cells than in wild-type cells, indicating genomic instability due to the deletion of p53. Other tumor initiators, methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (NMU), did not reveal apparent differences in cytotoxicity between wild-type and p53-deficient ES cells. Thus, ES test system using gene-modified ES cells may be used to categorize chemicals by detecting their characteristic effects on apoptosis, genotoxic potentials as well as general cytotoxicity.
26579714	Investigating DNA Binding and Conformational Variation in Temperature Sensitive p53 Cancer Mutants Using QM-MM Simulations.	Koulgi S, Achalere A, Sonavane U, Joshi R.	The tp53 gene is found to be mutated in 50% of all the cancers. The p53 protein, a product of tp53 gene, is a multi-domain protein. It consists of a core DNA binding domain (DBD) which is responsible for its binding and transcription of downstream target genes. The mutations in p53 protein are responsible for creating cancerous conditions and are found to be occurring at a high frequency in the DBD region of p53. Some of these mutations are also known to be temperature sensitive (ts) in nature. They are known to exhibit partial or strong binding with DNA in the temperature range (298-306 K). Whereas, at 310 K and above they show complete loss in binding. We have analyzed the changes in binding and conformational behavior at 300 K and 310 K for three of the ts-mutants viz., V143A, R249S and R175H. QM-MM simulations have been performed on the wild type and the above mentioned ts-mutants for 30 ns each. The optimal estimate of free energy of binding for a particular number of interface hydrogen bonds was calculated using the maximum likelihood method as described by Chodera et. al (2007). This parameter has been observed to be able to mimic the binding affinity of the p53 ts-mutants at 300 K and 310 K. Thus the correlation between MM-GBSA free energy of binding and hydrogen bonds formed by the interface residues between p53 and DNA has revealed the temperature dependent nature of these mutants. The role of main chain dihedrals was obtained by performing dihedral principal component analysis (PCA). This analysis, suggests that the conformational variations in the main chain dihedrals (ϕ and ψ) of the p53 ts-mutants may have caused reduction in the overall stability of the protein. The solvent exposure of the side chains of the interface residues were found to hamper the binding of the p53 to the DNA. Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA) also proved to be a crucial property in distinguishing the conformers obtained at 300 K and 310 K for the three ts-mutants from the wild type at 300 K.
25624478	Src phosphorylation converts Mdm2 from a ubiquitinating to a neddylating E3 ligase.	Batuello CN, Hauck PM, Gendron JM, Lehman JA, Mayo LD.	Murine double minute-2 protein (Mdm2) is a multifaceted phosphorylated protein that plays a role in regulating numerous proteins including the tumor suppressor protein p53. Mdm2 binds to and is involved in conjugating either ubiquitin or Nedd8 (Neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 8) to p53. Although regulation of the E3 ubiquitin activity of Mdm2 has been investigated, regulation of the neddylating activity of Mdm2 remains to be defined. Here we show that activated c-Src kinase phosphorylates Y281 and Y302 of Mdm2, resulting in an increase in Mdm2 stability and its association with Ubc12, the E2 enzyme of the neddylating complex. Mdm2-dependent Nedd8 conjugation of p53 results in transcriptionally inactive p53, a process that is reversed with a small molecule inhibitor to either Src or Ubc12. Thus, our studies reveal how Mdm2 may neutralize and elevate p53 in actively proliferating cells and also provides a rationale for using therapies that target the Nedd8 pathway in wild-type p53 tumors.
26238070	HAUSP-nucleolin interaction is regulated by p53-Mdm2 complex in response to DNA damage response.	Lim KH, Park JJ, Gu BH, Kim JO, Park SG, Baek KH.	HAUSP (herpes virus-associated ubiquitin specific protease, known as ubiquitin specific protease 7), one of DUBs, regulates the dynamics of the p53 and Mdm2 network in response to DNA damage by deubiquitinating both p53 and its E3 ubiquitin ligase, Mdm2. Its concerted action increases the level of functional p53 by preventing proteasome-dependent degradation of p53. However, the protein substrates that are targeted by HAUSP to mediate DNA damage responses in the context of the HAUSP-p53-Mdm2 complex are not fully identified. Here, we identified nucleolin as a new substrate for HAUSP by proteomic analysis. Nucleolin has two HAUSP binding sites in its N- and C-terminal regions, and the mutation of HAUSP interacting peptides on nucleolin disrupts their interaction and it leads to the increased level of nucleolin ubiquitination. In addition, HAUSP regulates the stability of nucleolin by removing ubiquitin from nucleolin. Nucleolin exists as a component of the HAUSP-p53-Mdm2 complex, and both Mdm2 and p53 are required for the interaction between HAUSP and nucleolin. Importantly, the irradiation increases the HAUSP-nucleolin interaction, leading to nucleolin stabilization significantly. Taken together, this study reveals a new component of the HAUSP-p53-Mdm2 complex that governs dynamic cellular responses to DNA damage.
25752699	p53 suppresses tetraploid development in mice.	Horii T, Yamamoto M, Morita S, Kimura M, Nagao Y, Hatada I.	Mammalian tetraploid embryos die in early development because of defects in the epiblast. Experiments with diploid/tetraploid chimeric mice, obtained via the aggregation of embryonic stem cells, clarified that while tetraploid cells are excluded from epiblast derivatives, diploid embryos with tetraploid extraembryonic tissues can develop to term. Today, this method, known as tetraploid complementation, is usually used for rescuing extraembryonic defects or for obtaining completely embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived pups. However, it is still unknown why defects occur in the epiblast during mammalian development. Here, we demonstrated that downregulation of p53, a tumour suppressor protein, rescued tetraploid development in the mammalian epiblast. Tetraploidy in differentiating epiblast cells triggered p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis, suggesting the activation of a tetraploidy checkpoint during early development. Finally, we found that p53 downregulation rescued tetraploid embryos later in gestation.
25380350	Anti-apoptotic NF-κB and "gain of function" mutp53 in concert act pro-apoptotic in response to UVB+IL-1 via enhanced TNF production.	Müller I, Beissert S, Kulms D.	In response to genotoxic stress, including UVB radiation, transcription factors NF-κB and p53 inevitably influence the cellular fate. Loss of p53 function has been attributed to malignant transformation and interferes with therapeutic interventions, whereas "gain of function" mutants even enhance tumor promotion. Constitutive NF-κB activation is linked to tumor maintenance and resistance against chemotherapy. The cross talk between p53 and NF-κB, however, is still under debate. Using the non-transformed keratinocyte cell line HaCaT, we shed light on the interplay between p53 and NF-κB by providing clear evidence that chronically activated NF-κB together with designated "gain of function" mutp53 promotes apoptosis via cooperative tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production in response to UVB+IL-1. Performing chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis we demonstrate that both transcription factors bind to the TNF promoter, whereas UVB-induced inhibition of Ser-Thr-phosphatase protein phosphatase 2A facilitates prolonged phosphorylation of NF-κB and the transcriptional cofactor cAMP response element-binding protein, both being required for extended TNF transcription. Thus, two major anti-apoptotic factors, NF-κB and mutp53, in concert may generate pro-apoptotic responses. As human skin is constantly exposed to UVB, causing IL-1 production as well, we hypothesize that the remarkable amount of hotspot p53 mutations within the epidermis (4%) may serve a protective function to eliminate precancerous cells at an early stage.
26221215	The up-regulation of miR-300 in gastric cancer and its effects on cells malignancy.	Shen Z, Li C, Zhang K, Yu W, Xiao H, Li B, Liu T.	OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the role of miR-300 in regulating cell proliferation and invasion of gastric cancer cells. METHODS: MicroRNA and protein expression patterns were compared between gastric cancer tissue and normal tissue and between two different prognostic groups. The up-regulation of miR-300 was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and its expression was analyzed in AGS gastric cancer cells. RESULTS: We observed that miR-300 expression was frequently and dramatically up-regulated in human gastric cancer tissues and cell lines compared with the matched adjacent normal tissues and cells. We further showed that transient and stable over-expression of miR-300 could promote cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. Moreover, p53, a key inhibitor of cell cycle, was verified as a direct target of miR-300, suggesting that miR-300 might promote gastric cancer cell proliferation and invasion by increasing p53 expression. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that miR-300 up-regulation might exert some sort of antagonistic function by targeting p53 in gastric cancer cell proliferation during gastric tumorigenesis.
26181206	Mutant p53-R273H mediates cancer cell survival and anoikis resistance through AKT-dependent suppression of BCL2-modifying factor (BMF).	Tan BS, Tiong KH, Choo HL, Fei-Lei Chung F, Hii LW, Tan SH, Yap IK, Pani S, Khor NT, Wong SF, Rosli R, Cheong SK, Leong CO.	p53 is the most frequently mutated tumor-suppressor gene in human cancers. Unlike other tumor-suppressor genes, p53 mutations mainly occur as missense mutations within the DNA-binding domain, leading to the expression of full-length mutant p53 protein. Mutant p53 proteins not only lose their tumor-suppressor function, but may also gain new oncogenic functions and promote tumorigenesis. Here, we showed that silencing of endogenous p53-R273H contact mutant, but not p53-R175H conformational mutant, reduced AKT phosphorylation, induced BCL2-modifying factor (BMF) expression, sensitized BIM dissociation from BCL-XL and induced mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in cancer cells. Importantly, cancer cells harboring endogenous p53-R273H mutant were also found to be inherently resistant to anoikis and lack BMF induction following culture in suspension. Underlying these activities is the ability of p53-R273H mutant to suppress BMF expression that is dependent on constitutively active PI3K/AKT signaling. Collectively, these findings suggest that p53-R273H can specifically drive AKT signaling and suppress BMF expression, resulting in enhanced cell survivability and anoikis resistance. These findings open the possibility that blocking of PI3K/AKT will have therapeutic benefit in mutant p53-R273H expressing cancers.
25847422	The impact of chronic Aflatoxin B1 exposure and p53 genotype on base excision repair in mouse lung and liver.	Mulder JE, Bondy GS, Mehta R, Massey TE.	Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is produced by species of Aspergillus, and is a known human carcinogen. AFB1-induced oxidative DNA damage, specifically 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) lesions, has been demonstrated in both animal models and in humans, and is repaired by base excision repair (BER). The tumour suppressor gene p53 is implicated in the regulation of DNA repair, and heterozygous p53 knockouts have an attenuated nucleotide excision repair response to AFB1. Male heterozygous p53 knockout mice and their wild-type controls were exposed to 0, 0.2 or 1.0ppm AFB1 for 26 weeks in their diet. BER activity of lung and liver was assessed with an in vitro assay, using 8-OHdG-damaged plasmid DNA as a substrate. BER activity did not differ between livers or lungs from untreated wild-type versus heterozygous p53 knockout mice. In wild-type mice, repair was 65% lower in liver extracts from mice exposed to 1.0ppm AFB1 than in liver extracts from mice exposed to 0.2ppm AFB1 (p<0.05), but not significantly lower than that in liver extracts from control mice. AFB1 did not affect BER in lung extracts from wild-type mice, or in lung and liver extracts from heterozygous p53 knockout mice. In liver and lung, AFB1 exposure did not alter levels of 8-oxoguanine glycosylase protein, a key enzyme in the repair of 8-OHdG, and did not cause hepatotoxicity, as indicated by plasma alanine aminotransferase levels. In conclusion, chronic exposure to AFB1 did not affect BER in lungs or livers of heterozygous p53 knockout mice. BER activity was lower in livers from p53 wild type mice exposed to 1.0ppm AFB1 versus those exposed to 0.2ppm AFB1, an effect that was not attributable to liver cell death or altered levels of 8-oxoguanine glycosylase.
25444916	Curcumin promotes apoptosis by activating the p53-miR-192-5p/215-XIAP pathway in non-small cell lung cancer.	Ye M, Zhang J, Zhang J, Miao Q, Yao L, Zhang J.	Curcumin has attracted increasing interest as an anti-cancer drug for decades. The mechanisms of action involve multiple cancer-related signaling pathways. Recent studies highlighted curcumin has epigenetic regulatory effects on miRNA in cancers. In the present study, we demonstrated the proapoptotic effects of curcumin in vitro and in vivo. miRNA microarray and qPCR indicated that miR-192-5p and miR-215 were the most responsive miRNAs upon curcumin treatment in H460 and A427 cells. Functional studies showed miR-192-5p/215 were putative tumor suppressors in non-small cell lung cancer. Curcumin also promoted miR-192-5p/215 expressions in A549 cells (p53 wild type) but not in H1299 cells (p53-null). Conditional knockdown of p53 by tetracycline inducible expression system significantly abrogated curcumin-induced miR-192-5p/215 upregulation in the p53 wild-type H460, A427 and A549 cells. Conversely, ectopic expression of exogenous wild-type but not R273H mutant p53 in the p53-null H1299 cells enabled miR-192-5p/215 response to curcumin treatment. The proapoptotic effects of curcumin also depended on miR-192-5p/215 induction, and antagonizing miR-192-5p/215 expression attenuated curcumin-induced apoptosis in H460, A427 and A549 cells, but not in H1299 cells. Finally, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) is proved to be a novel transcriptional target of miR-192-5p/215. Taken together, this study highlights that the proapoptotic effects of curcumin depend on miR-192-5p/215 induction and the p53-miR-192-5p/215-XIAP pathway is an important therapeutic target for non-small cell lung cancer.
26413353	The prognostic significance of p53, p63 and her2 expression in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer in relation to treatment with bacille Calmette-Guerin.	Hegazy R, Kamel M, Salem EA, Salem NA, Fawzy A, Sakr A, El-Farargy O, Nawar N, El-Atar A, Shahin AM, Hegazy A.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the immunohistochemical expression of p53, p63 and her2/neu is correlated with the prognosis of tumour recurrence and progression in patients with non-muscle invasive (NMI) bladder cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 88 patients diagnosed with NMI transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder in a Urology Department from May 2009 to April 2014 were included in the study. Paraffin-embedded specimens were obtained by transurethral resection of the bladder tumours. Sections on haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides were examined histologically and tumour grade was classified according to the World Health Organisation system (2004) Mostofi classification. The sections were evaluated using p63, p53 and her2/neu immunohistochemical staining before and after immunotherapy with bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), and patients were followed up for 36 months in the Urology Department. RESULTS: For tumour grade there was a significant relationship with the overexpression of p53 (P = 0.010), her2 (P = 0.025) and negativity of p63 (P = 0.025). There was no significant relationship between p53 or her2/neu overexpression and tumour stage. However, there was a significant correlation (P = 0.005) between p63 negativity and tumour stage. There was a significant relationship between p53 (P = 0.01), her2/neu (P = 0.025) overexpression and p63 negativity (P = 0.005) and tumour recurrence and progression. CONCLUSION: Patients with transitional cell carcinoma who are selected for BCG treatment should preferably be positively immunoreactive for p63, but negative for both p53 and her2/neu. These patients were less susceptible to recurrence and/or progression after BCG adjuvant therapy. Further studies are needed to investigate the relationship between these three markers and treatment with anti-her2/neu therapies.
25393365	The BMP pathway either enhances or inhibits the Wnt pathway depending on the SMAD4 and p53 status in CRC.	Voorneveld PW, Kodach LL, Jacobs RJ, van Noesel CJ, Peppelenbosch MP, Korkmaz KS, Molendijk I, Dekker E, Morreau H, van Pelt GW, Tollenaar RA, Mesker W, Hawinkels LJ, Paauwe M, Verspaget HW, Geraets DT, Hommes DW, Offerhaus GJ, van den Brink GR, Ten Dijke P, Hardwick JC.	BACKGROUND: Constitutive Wnt activation is essential for colorectal cancer (CRC) initiation but also underlies the cancer stem cell phenotype, metastasis and chemosensitivity. Importantly Wnt activity is still modulated as evidenced by higher Wnt activity at the invasive front of clonal tumours termed the β-catenin paradox. SMAD4 and p53 mutation status and the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway are known to affect Wnt activity. The combination of SMAD4 loss, p53 mutations and BMP signalling may integrate to influence Wnt signalling and explain the β-catenin paradox. METHODS: We analysed the expression patterns of SMAD4, p53 and β-catenin at the invasive front of CRCs using immunohistochemistry. We activated BMP signalling in CRC cells in vitro and measured BMP/Wnt activity using luciferase reporters. MTT assays were performed to study the effect of BMP signalling on CRC chemosensitivity. RESULTS: Eighty-four percent of CRCs with high nuclear β-catenin staining are SMAD4 negative and/or p53 aberrant. BMP signalling inhibits Wnt signalling in CRC only when p53 and SMAD4 are unaffected. In the absence of SMAD4, BMP signalling activates Wnt signalling. When p53 is lost or mutated, BMP signalling no longer influences Wnt signalling. The cytotoxic effects of 5-FU are influenced in a similar manner. CONCLUSIONS: The BMP signalling pathway differentially modulates Wnt signalling dependent on the SMAD4 and p53 status. The use of BMPs in cancer therapy, as has been proposed by previous studies, should be targeted to individual cancers based on the mutational status of p53 and SMAD4.
25088193	Mice engineered for an obligatory Mdm4 exon skipping express higher levels of the Mdm4-S isoform but exhibit increased p53 activity.	Bardot B, Bouarich-Bourimi R, Leemput J, Lejour V, Hamon A, Plancke L, Jochemsen AG, Simeonova I, Fang M, Toledo F.	Mdm4, a protein related to the ubiquitin-ligase Mdm2, is an essential inhibitor of tumor suppressor protein p53. In both human and mouse cells, the Mdm4 gene encodes two major transcripts: one encodes the full-length oncoprotein (designated below as Mdm4-FL), whereas the other, resulting from a variant splicing that skips exon 6, encodes the shorter isoform Mdm4-S. Importantly, increased Mdm4-S mRNA levels were observed in several human cancers, and correlated with poor survival. However, the role of Mdm4-S in cancer progression remains controversial, because the Mdm4-S protein appeared to be a potent p53 inhibitor when overexpressed, but the splice variant also leads to a decrease in Mdm4-FL expression. To unambiguously determine the physiological impact of the Mdm4-S splice variant, we generated a mouse model with a targeted deletion of the Mdm4 exon 6, thereby creating an obligatory exon skipping. The mutant allele (Mdm4(ΔE6)) prevented the expression of Mdm4-FL, but also led to increased Mdm4-S mRNA levels. Mice homozygous for this allele died during embryonic development, but were rescued by a concomitant p53 deficiency. Furthermore in a hypomorphic p53(ΔP/ΔP) context, the Mdm4(ΔE6) allele led to p53 activation and delayed the growth of oncogene-induced tumors. We next determined the effect of Mdm4(+/ΔE6) heterozygosity in a hypermorphic p53(+/Δ31) genetic background, recently shown to be extremely sensitive to Mdm4 activity. Mdm4(+/ΔE6) p53(+/Δ31) pups were born, but suffered from aplastic anemia and died before weaning, again indicating an increased p53 activity. Our results demonstrate that the main effect of a skipping of Mdm4 exon 6 is not the synthesis of the Mdm4-S protein, but rather a decrease in Mdm4-FL expression. These and other data suggest that increased Mdm4-S mRNA levels might correlate with more aggressive cancers without encoding significant amounts of a potential oncoprotein. Hypotheses that may account for this apparent paradox are discussed.
26204652	THE PROGNOSTIC SIGNIFICANCE OF P53, BCL2 AND MIB1 EXPRESSIONS RELATED WITH OTHER CLINICOPATHOLOGICAL VARIABLES IN SEROUS OVARIAN CARCINOMAS. A CLINICOPATHOLOGICAL STUDY IN PERITONEAL FLUIDS.	Kalogeraki A, Tamiolakis D, Matalliotaki C, Karvela-Kalogeraki I, Karvelas-Kalogerakis M, Segredakis J, Sinatkas V, Matalliotakis I.	OBJECTIVE: The first cytological study examining the expression of P53, BCL2 and MIB 1 expressions in correlation with other clinicopathological parameters in ascitic fluids of patients with serous ovarian carcinomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty women 35-75 years old were diagnosed cytologically and confirmed histologically after operation in the University Hospital of Crete. All carcinomas were serous type and eight(8) of grade I, eighteen (18) of grade II and twenty two (22) of grade III. All carcinomas were staged according to the Figo criteria. Fifteen (15) were of Figo stage III and thirty five (35) were of Figo stage IV. For p53 and bcl-2, staining was evaluated on a semiquantitative scale depending on the number of cells showing positivity. For MIB1, the percentage of positive nuclei was calculated. Main outcome measure(s): The expression of P53, BCL2 and MIB 1 (Ki 67) correlated with tumor grade and Figo stages were estimated by chi-square (χ2). RESULTS: The expression of P53 and MIB1 were found to be statistically significant (p < 0.005) correlated with Figo stage and tumor grade. A statistical significant correlation was also found between BCL2 expression and tumor Grade ( p < 0.005) but not between BCL2 expression and Figo Stage. The study found a high expression of P53 (64%) and MIB1 (72%) and an expression of BCL2 (48%) in ascitic fluid of patients with ovarian carcinoma. A statistically significant correlation between P53 and MIB1 expression correlated with tumor grade and Figo stage (p < 0.005) and a statistically significant correlation between BCL2 expression and tumor grade but no with the Figo stage was found (p < 0.005). There was a positive correlation between P53 and MIB1. No significant association was found between P53 and BCL2 expression or MIB1 labeling index. CONCLUSION(S): Our data show significant differences in the expression of these markers in ovarian tumors and suggest a possible role for these tumor-associated genes as supplemental tools in prognosis and further definition of the biologic potential of these tumors.
26331536	Gain-of-function p53 mutants co-opt chromatin pathways to drive cancer growth.	Zhu J, Sammons MA, Donahue G, Dou Z, Vedadi M, Getlik M, Barsyte-Lovejoy D, Al-awar R, Katona BW, Shilatifard A, Huang J, Hua X, Arrowsmith CH, Berger SL.	TP53 (which encodes p53 protein) is the most frequently mutated gene among all human cancers. Prevalent p53 missense mutations abrogate its tumour suppressive function and lead to a 'gain-of-function' (GOF) that promotes cancer. Here we show that p53 GOF mutants bind to and upregulate chromatin regulatory genes, including the methyltransferases MLL1 (also known as KMT2A), MLL2 (also known as KMT2D), and acetyltransferase MOZ (also known as KAT6A or MYST3), resulting in genome-wide increases of histone methylation and acetylation. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas shows specific upregulation of MLL1, MLL2, and MOZ in p53 GOF patient-derived tumours, but not in wild-type p53 or p53 null tumours. Cancer cell proliferation is markedly lowered by genetic knockdown of MLL1 or by pharmacological inhibition of the MLL1 methyltransferase complex. Our study reveals a novel chromatin mechanism underlying the progression of tumours with GOF p53, and suggests new possibilities for designing combinatorial chromatin-based therapies for treating individual cancers driven by prevalent GOF p53 mutations.
25981963	The MDM4/MDM2-p53-IGF1 axis controls axonal regeneration, sprouting and functional recovery after CNS injury.	Joshi Y, Sória MG, Quadrato G, Inak G, Zhou L, Hervera A, Rathore KI, Elnaggar M, Cucchiarini M, Marine JC, Puttagunta R, Di Giovanni S.	Regeneration of injured central nervous system axons is highly restricted, causing neurological impairment. To date, although the lack of intrinsic regenerative potential is well described, a key regulatory molecular mechanism for the enhancement of both axonal regrowth and functional recovery after central nervous system injury remains elusive. While ubiquitin ligases coordinate neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity during development as well as after axonal injury, their role specifically in axonal regeneration is unknown. Following a bioinformatics network analysis combining ubiquitin ligases with previously defined axonal regenerative proteins, we found a triad composed of the ubiquitin ligases MDM4, MDM2 and the transcription factor p53 (encoded by TP53) as a putative central signalling complex restricting the regeneration program. Indeed, conditional deletion of MDM4 or pharmacological inhibition of MDM2/p53 interaction in the eye and spinal cord promote axonal regeneration and sprouting of the optic nerve after crush and of supraspinal tracts after spinal cord injury. The double conditional deletion of MDM4-p53 as well as MDM2 inhibition in p53-deficient mice blocks this regenerative phenotype, showing its dependence upon p53. Genome-wide gene expression analysis from ex vivo fluorescence-activated cell sorting in MDM4-deficient retinal ganglion cells identifies the downstream target IGF1R, whose activity and expression was found to be required for the regeneration elicited by MDM4 deletion. Importantly, we demonstrate that pharmacological enhancement of the MDM2/p53-IGF1R axis enhances axonal sprouting as well as functional recovery after spinal cord injury. Thus, our results show MDM4-MDM2/p53-IGF1R as an original regulatory mechanism for CNS regeneration and offer novel targets to enhance neurological recovery.media-1vid110.1093/brain/awv125_video_abstractawv125_video_abstract.
25353185	Progesterone receptor-NFκB complex formation is required for progesterone-induced NFκB nuclear translocation and binding onto the p53 promoter.	Hsu SP, Yang HC, Kuo CT, Wen HC, Chen LC, Huo YN, Lee WS.	We previously demonstrated that progesterone (P4) up-regulates p53 expression in human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVECs) through P4 receptor (PR) activation of extranuclear signaling pathways. However, the involvement of nuclear PR in P4-increased p53 expression is still unclear. Here, the molecular mechanism underlying PR-regulated p53 expression in HUVECs was investigated. Treatment with P4 increased nuclear factor of κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, α phosphorylation (IκBα and nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) nuclear translocation. Interestingly, P4 also increased PR-A, but not PR-B, nuclear translocation in HUVECs. Immunoprecipitation assay illustrated that P4 increased the formation of PR-A-NFκB complex in both the cytosol and the nucleus of HUVEC. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed an interaction between PR and the NFκB binding motif on the p53 promoter. Ablation of the NFκB binding motif in the p53 promoter completely abolished P4-increased p53 promoter activity. In the absence of P4, overexpression of NFκB did not increase NFκB nuclear translocation. In contrast, treatment of NFκB-overexpressing HUVECs with P4 for only 4 hours, which is much shorter than the time (21.5 h) required for P4-induced IκBα phosphorylation, increased NFκB nuclear translocation. Blockade of PR activity abolished this effect. Taken together, these results uncover a novel role of PR for P4-induced NFκB nuclear translocation and suggest that PR-A-NFκB complex formation is required for NFκB nuclear translocation and binding onto the p53 promoter in HUVECs. Our data indicate that both nuclear and extranuclear signaling pathways of PR are involved in P4-regulated p53 expression in HUVECs.
25791630	Involvement of dysregulated Wip1 in manganese-induced p53 signaling and neuronal apoptosis.	Ma X, Han J, Wu Q, Liu H, Shi S, Wang C, Wang Y, Xiao J, Zhao J, Jiang J, Wan C.	Overexposure to manganese (Mn) has been known to induce neuronal death and neurodegenerative symptoms. However, the precise mechanisms underlying Mn neurotoxicity remain incompletely understood. In the present study, we established a Mn-exposed rat model and found that downregulation of wild type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (Wip1) might contribute to p53 activation and resultant neuronal apoptosis following Mn exposure. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the expression of Wip1 was markedly decreased following Mn exposure. In addition, immunofluorescence assay demonstrated that Mn exposure led to significant reduction in the number of Wip1-positive neurons. Accordingly, the expression of Mdm2 was progressively decreased, which was accompanied with markedly increased expression of p53, as well as the ratio of Bax/Bcl-xl. Furthermore, we showed that Mn exposure decreased the viability and induced apparent apoptosis in NFG-differentiated neuron-like PC12 cells. Importantly, the expression of Wip1 decreased progressively, whereas the level of cellular p53 and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-xl were elevated, which resembled the expression of the proteins in animal model studies. Depletion of p53 significantly ameliorated Mn-mediated cytotoxic effect in PC12 cells. In addition, ectopic expression of Wip1 attenuated Mn-induced p53 signaling as well as apoptosis in PC12 cells. Finally, we observed that depletion of Wip1 augmented Mn-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that downregulated Wip1 expression plays an important role in Mn-induced neuronal death in the brain striatum via the modulation of p53 signaling.
26091798	Human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells, an appropriate in vitro model to study heavy metals induced carcinogenesis.	Park YH, Kim D, Dai J, Zhang Z.	Occupational and environmental exposure to arsenic (III) and chromium VI (Cr(VI)) have been confirmed to cause lung cancer. Mechanisms of these metals carcinogenesis are still under investigation. Selection of cell lines to be used is essential for the studies. Human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells are the cells to be utilized by most of scientists. However, due to p53 missense mutation (CCG→TCG) at codon 47 and the codon 72 polymorphism (CGC→CCC) in BEAS-2B cells, its usage has frequently been questioned. The present study has examined activity and expression of 53 and its downstream target protein p21 upon acute or chronic exposure of BEAS-2B cells to arsenic and Cr(VI). The results show that short-term exposure of BEAS-2B cells to arsenic or Cr(VI) was able to activate both p53 and p21. Chronic exposure of BEAS-2B cells to these two metals caused malignant cell transformation and tumorigenesis. In arsenic-transformed BEAS-2B cells reductions in p53 promoter activity, mRNA expression, and phosphorylation of p53 at Ser392 were observed, while the total p53 protein level remained the same compared to those in passage-matched parent ones. p21 promoter activity and expression were decreased in arsenic-transformed cells. Cr(VI)-transformed cells exhibit elevated p53 promoter activity, mRNA expression, and phosphorylation at Ser15, but reduced phosphorylation at Ser392 and total p53 protein level compared to passage-matched parent ones. p21 promoter activity and expression were elevated in Cr(VI)-transformed cells. These results demonstrate that p53 is able to respond to exposure of arsenic or Cr(VI), suggesting that BEAS-2B cells are an appropriate in vitro model to investigate arsenic or Cr(VI) induced lung cancer.
26124546	Bax modulates neuronal survival while p53 is unaltered after Cytochrome C induced oxidative stress in the adult olfactory bulb in vivo.	Ogundele OM, Sanya OJ.	BACKGROUND: The granule and periglomerular cells of the olfactory bulb migrate from the sub-ventricular zone (SVZ) as progenitor cell forming the neuronal stream of the rostral olfactory bulb. These cells are characterized by their ability to divide while expressing adult proteins; a phenomenon attributed to the prolonged cell cycle and the regulatory activities of proteins which modulates apoptosis and proliferation in the developing nervous system. Of interest are the proteins concerned with tumor suppression (p53) and cell cycle exit (Bax) and how they regulate survivability of these neurons in the adult system after an induced oxidative stress. PURPOSE: This study sets to investigate the interplay between p53 and Bax in the adult olfactory bulb (periglomerular and granule cell layer), and how these proteins determine proliferation and neuronal survival after Cytochrome C induced-oxidative stress. Also, we demonstrate the effect of the induced-stress threshold on such regulation in vivo. METHODS: Adult Wistar rats were segregated into three groups. 10 and 20 mg/Kg BW of potassium cyanide (KCN) was administered to the treatment groups for 15 days while the control received normal saline for the same duration. The olfactory bulb was dissected and processed for general histology and immunohistochemistry of p53/Bax in the periglomerular and granule cell layers. Total (Histology) and immunopositive (p53 and Bax) cell count was done using Image J. Subsequently, we determined the analysis of variance with significance set at *P<0.05. RESULTS: We observed an increase in cell count for the 10 mg/KgBW treatment; this was characterized by a significant decrease in Bax expression and no change in p53 expression when this treatment group was compared to the control. However, no change was observed in the total cell count for 20 mg/Kg BW treatment for the same duration of exposure. Interestingly, there was also no significant change in Bax and p53 for this treatment when compared with the control. CONCLUSION: Although p53 plays an important role in development of the olfactory bulb neurons, our findings suggests it has little contribution in neuronal cell viability and proliferation in the adult olfactory bulb. No significant change in p53 was observed irrespective of treatment dose and cell count while Bax expression was reduced at 10 mg/Kg BW treatment and was associated with an increased cell count. We conclude that regulation of survival of neurons in the adult olfactory bulb, following induced-oxidative stress was more dependent of the expression of Bax and the threshold of the induced stress rather than p53 expression.
26297485	The beneficial effect of Zinc(II) on low-dose chemotherapeutic sensitivity involves p53 activation in wild-type p53-carrying colorectal cancer cells.	Garufi A, Ubertini V, Mancini F, D'Orazi V, Baldari S, Moretti F, Bossi G, D'Orazi G.	Activation of wild-type p53 in response to genotoxic stress occurs through different mechanisms including protein conformation, posttranslational modifications, and nuclear localization, leading to DNA binding to sequence-specific promoters. Zinc ion plays a crucial role in stabilizing p53/DNA binding to induce canonical target genes. Mutant p53 proteins undergo protein misfolding that can be counteracted by zinc. However, whether zinc supplementation might have a beneficial antitumor effect in wild-type p53-carrying cells in combination with drugs, has not been addressed so far.In this study we compared the effect of two antitumor treatments: on the one hand wild-type p53-carrying colon cancer cells were treated with low and high doses of chemotherapeutic agent Adriamycin and, on the other hand, Adriamycin was used in combination with ZnCl2. Biochemical and molecular analyses were applied to evaluate p53 activity and biological outcomes in this setting. Finally, the effect of the different combination treatments were applied to assess tumor growth in vivo in tumor xenografts.We found that low-dose Adriamycin did not induce p53 activation in wtp53-carrying colon cancer cells, unless in combination with ZnCl2. Mechanistically, ZnCl2 was a key determinant in inducing wtp53/DNA binding and transactivation of target genes in response to low-dose Adriamycin that used alone did not achieve such effects. Finally, in vivo studies, in a model of wtp53 colon cancer xenograft, show that low-dose Adriamycin did not induce tumor regression unless in combination with ZnCl2 that activated endogenous wtp53.These results provide evidence that ZnCl2 might be a valuable adjuvant in chemotherapeutic regimens of colorectal cancer harboring wild-type p53, able to both activate p53 and reduce the amount of drugs for antitumor purposes.
26123760	P53 codon 72 polymorphism, human papillomavirus infection, and their interaction to oral carcinoma susceptibility.	Hou J, Gu Y, Hou W, Wu S, Lou Y, Yang W, Zhu L, Hu Y, Sun M, Xue H.	BACKGROUND: Tumor suppressor gene p53 plays an important role in the maintenance of the genomic integrity, and mutation in the gene may alter an individual's susceptibility to various carcinomas. P53 Arg72Pro or codon 72 polymorphism has been indicated to increase the risk of developing certain cancers such as bladder cancer and cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has been shown as a risk factor for certain cancers such as cervical cancer and oral cancer as well, and the HPV oncoprotein E6 may induce the degradation of p53 function. However, the association between p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and the risk of oral cancer with HPV infection remains inconclusive. Therefore, this meta-analysis involving 5,614 participants was performed to investigate the relations among the p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism, HPV infection, and the risk of developing oral cancer. RESULTS: A search of the literature by PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases was conducted to identify studies based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were combined using a random-effect model or a fixed-effect model. The current study was conducted with 13 studies consisting of 2,413 cases and 3,201 controls. Neither overall analysis nor stratified analyses detected any obvious evidence of association between p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and oral cancer susceptibility in all genetic models. However, a significant association between p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and the risk of oral cancer with HPV infection was detected in the Arg/Arg vs. Arg/Pro + Pro/Pro model. CONCLUSION: In the current meta-analysis which used the quantitative data synthesis for the first time, our study demonstrated that p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism together with HPV infection might jointly alter an individual's susceptibility to the risk of oral cancer. Our results suggested that p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism may partly contribute to the pathogenesis of oral cancer development.
26568852	Status of p53 and p27(KIP1) in Iranian Patients With Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.	Etemad-Moghadam S, Keyhani A, Yazdani K, Alaeddini M.	Alterations in p53 and p27(KIP1) have been documented as important events in the carcinogenesis of various cancers, but their prognostic role in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains controversial.The present investigation aimed to evaluate the clinicopathologic and prognostic significance of p53 and p27(KIP1) expression in a group of Iranian patients with OSCC.In this analytical cross-sectional study, medical records of patients with primary OSCC, diagnosed from 1994 to 2004 were reviewed and 28 subjects were selected based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Immunohistochemical staining using monoclonal antibodies against p53 and p27(KIP1) was performed on representative archival paraffin blocks. Demographic data along with information on p53 and p27(KIP1) expression, recurrence, and tumor grade was statistically analyzed using the Fischer exact test. Prognostic factors for overall survival were determined by Cox regression analysis (P < 0.05).p53 and p27(KIP1) expression were found in 28.57% (8 positive versus 20 negative) and 67.85% (19 positive versus 9 negative) of OSCC cases, respectively. There was no significant association between these two proteins (P = 0.371), and neither of them showed a significant relationship with the studied clinicopathologic variables (P > 0.05). In survival analysis, only histopathologic differentiation (17 low and moderate, 11 poor) demonstrated a significant correlation with overall survival (P = 0.048).Despite the fact that abnormalities in p53 and p27(KIP1) may be involved in the development of OSCC, their clinical significance in the studied population seems limited. Further investigation on the combined p53/p27(KIP1) expression may be helpful in predicting the biologic behavior of this tumor.
25823924	NF2 blocks Snail-mediated p53 suppression in mesothelioma.	Cho JH, Lee SJ, Oh AY, Yoon MH, Woo TG, Park BJ.	Although asbestos causes malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), rising from lung mesothelium, the molecular mechanism has not been suggested until now. Extremely low mutation rate in classical tumor suppressor genes (such as p53 and pRb) and oncogenes (including Ras or myc) indicates that there would be MPM-specific carcinogenesis pathway. To address this, we treated silica to mimic mesothelioma carcinogenesis in mesothelioma and non-small cell lung cancer cell lines (NSCLC). Treatment of silica induced p-Erk and Snail through RKIP reduction. In addition, p53 and E-cadherin were decreased by silica-treatment. Elimination of Snail restored p53 expression. We found that NF2 (frequently deleted in MPM) inhibited Snail-mediated p53 suppression and was stabilized by RKIP. Importantly, GN25, an inhibitor of p53-Snail interaction, induced p53 and apoptosis. These results indicate that MPM can be induced by reduction of RKIP/NF2, which suppresses p53 through Snail. Thus, the p53-Snail binding inhibitor such as GN25 is a drug candidate for MPM.
25492482	p53 suppresses CCL2-induced subcutaneous tumor xenograft.	Tang X, Amar S.	Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) has recently been found to be a key player in the pathology of many human glomerular and tubulointerstitial diseases. CCL2 has also been found to be expressed in various cancers, including human hepatoma cells, human cancer progression, and human multiple myeloma cells. Thus, the inhibition of elevated CCL2 production may provide a new avenue for therapeutic intervention in CCL2-mediated cancer diseases. A previous study has indicated that knockdown of human p53 has a strong negative impact on CCL2 induction. We therefore are interested in how p53 regulates CCL2 gene expression. In the following study, our findings indicate that p53 binds to CCL2, consequently significantly downregulating CCL2 promoter activity. Furthermore, injection of CCL2-promoting cancer cells (CCL2/A549) in p53-deficient mice for 3 weeks strongly induced subcutaneous xenograft tumor growth compared with the control. Overall, the research results support the novel role of p53 in suppression of chemokine (such as CCL2)-mediated cancer diseases.
25550427	A naturally occurring 4-bp deletion in the intron 4 of p53 creates a spectrum of novel p53 isoforms with anti-apoptosis function.	Shi H, Tao T, Huang D, Ou Z, Chen J, Peng J.	p53 functions as a tumor suppressor by transcriptionally regulating the expression of genes involved in controlling cell proliferation or apoptosis. p53 and its isoform Δ133p53/Δ113p53 form a negative regulation loop in that p53 activates the expression of Δ133p53/Δ113p53 while Δ133p53/Δ113p53 specifically antagonizes p53 apoptotic activity. This pathway is especially important to safeguard the process of embryogenesis because sudden activation of p53 by DNA damage signals or developmental stress is detrimental to a developing embryo. Here we report the identification of five novel p53 isoforms. p53β is generated due to alternative splicing of the intron 8 of p53 while the other four, namely, TA2p53, TA3p53, TA4p53 and TA5p53, result from the combination of alternative splicing of intron 1 (within intron 4 of the p53 gene) of the Δ113p53 gene and a naturally occurring CATT 4 bp deletion within the alternative splicing product in zebrafish. The CATT 4 bp deletion creates four translation start codons which are in-frame to the open reading frame of Δ113p53. We also show that TAp53 shares the same promoter with Δ113p53 and functions to antagonize p53 apoptotic activity. The identification of Δ113p53/TA2/3/4/5p53 reveals a pro-survival mechanism which operates robustly during embryogenesis in response to the DNA-damage condition.
24608433	Mdmx promotes genomic instability independent of p53 and Mdm2.	Carrillo AM, Bouska A, Arrate MP, Eischen CM.	The oncogene Mdmx is overexpressed in many human malignancies, and together with Mdm2, negatively regulates the p53 tumor suppressor. However, a p53-independent function of Mdmx that impacts genome stability has been described, but this function is not well understood. In the present study, we determined that of the 13 different cancer types evaluated, 6-90% of those that had elevated levels of Mdmx had concurrent inactivation (mutated or deleted) of p53. We show elevated levels of Mdmx-inhibited double-strand DNA break repair and induced chromosome and chromatid breaks independent of p53, leading to genome instability. Mdmx impaired early DNA damage-response signaling, such as phosphorylation of the serine/threonine-glutamine motif, mediated by the ATM kinase. Moreover, we identified Mdmx associated with Nbs1 of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) DNA repair complex, and this association increased upon DNA damage and was detected at chromatin. Elevated Mdmx levels also increased cellular transformation in a p53-independent manner. Unexpectedly, all Mdmx-mediated phenotypes also occurred in cells lacking Mdm2 and were independent of the Mdm2-binding domain (RING) of Mdmx. Therefore, Mdmx-mediated inhibition of the DNA damage response resulted in delayed DNA repair and increased genome instability and transformation independent of p53 and Mdm2. Our results reveal a novel p53- and Mdm2-independent oncogenic function of Mdmx that provides new insight into the many cancers that overexpress Mdmx.
25636033	BRCA1 and p53 tumor suppressor molecules in Alzheimer's disease.	Nakanishi A, Minami A, Kitagishi Y, Ogura Y, Matsuda S.	Tumor suppressor molecules play a pivotal role in regulating DNA repair, cell proliferation, and cell death, which are also important processes in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, however, the precise molecular events that control the death of neuronal cells are unclear. Recently, a fundamental role for tumor suppressor molecules in regulating neurons in Alzheimer's disease was highlighted. Generally, onset of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease may be delayed with use of dietary neuro-protective agents against oxidative stresses. Studies suggest that dietary antioxidants are also beneficial for brain health in reducing disease-risk and in slowing down disease-progression. We summarize research advances in dietary regulation for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease with a focus on its modulatory roles in BRCA1 and p53 tumor suppressor expression, in support of further therapeutic research in this field.
26494212	Expression of P53 and HSP70 in Chronic Hepatitis, Liver Cirrhosis, and Early and Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma Tissues and Their Diagnostic Value in Hepatocellular Carcinoma: An Immunohistochemical Study.	Wang Z, Gou W, Liu M, Sang W, Chu H, Zhang W.	BACKGROUND Tumor protein (P53) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) play key roles in chronic liver diseases. This study aimed to characterize P53 and HSP70 expression in chronic hepatitis (CH), liver cirrhosis (LC), early and advanced HCC, and to analyze their diagnostic value in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MATERIAL AND METHODS Immunohistochemical staining was conducted to evaluate the expression of P53 and HSP70 in 200 human liver tissue specimens, with advanced HCC (n=80), early HCC (n=30), CH (n=30), LC (n=30), and Controls (n=30). RESULTS P53 expression levels were lower in LC than those of HCC, but remained on par with those of CH and Controls. HSP70 expression levels were higher in HCC than those of LC, CH, and Controls. The sensitivity and specificity for HCC diagnosis were: 50.9% and 98.9% for P53, and 78.2 and 77.8% for HSP70, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of different combinations were: 95.5% and 85.5% with either P53 or HSP70 being positive, and 33.6% and 98.9% if both were positive. Among the differentiation stages marked low, intermediate, and high in HCC, the P53 positive rate was higher in the low than in the intermediate, which was higher than that in the high. HSP70 positive rate was higher in the low and the intermediate than in the high, but no obvious changes were found between the low and the intermediate. CONCLUSIONS P53 and HSP70 could be potential biomarkers for HCC diagnosis, and proper combinations of these 2 markers could improve diagnostic accuracy.
25797244	BRCA1 regulates PIG3-mediated apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner.	Zhang W, Luo J, Chen F, Yang F, Song W, Zhu A, Guan X.	BRCA1 plays a key role in the regulation of p53-dependent target gene transcription activation. Meanwhile, the p53 inducible gene 3 (PIG3) is a downstream target of p53 and is involved in p53-initiated apoptosis. However, little is known about whether BRCA1 can regulate PIG3-mediated apoptosis. Using a tissue microarray containing 149 breast cancer patient samples, we found that BRCA1 and PIG3 expression status were significantly positively correlated (r = 0.678, P < 0.001) and identified a significant positive correlation between high expression of BRCA1 and/or PIG3 and overall survival (OS). Moreover, we reveal that overexpression of BRCA1 significantly increased expression of PIG3 in cells with intact p53, whereas no increase in PIG3 was observed in p53-null MDA-MB-157 cells and p53-depleted HCT116p53-/- cells. Meanwhile, ectopic expression of BRCA1 could not lead to an increase expression level of prohibitin (PHB), which we have previously identified to induce PIG3-mediated apoptosis. Finally, ChIP analysis revealed that PHB can bind to the PIG3 promoter and activate PIG3 transcription independent of p53, although p53 presence did enhance this process. Taken together, our findings suggest that BRCA1 regulates PIG3-mediated apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner, and that PIG3 expression is associated with a better OS in breast cancer patients.
25441426	Structure and apoptotic function of p73.	Yoon MK, Ha JH, Lee MS, Chi SW.	p73 is a structural and functional homologue of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Like p53, p73 induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest and transactivates p53-responsive genes, conferring its tumor suppressive activity. In addition, p73 has unique roles in neuronal development and differentiation. The importance of p73-induced apoptosis lies in its capability to substitute the pro-apoptotic activity of p53 in various human cancer cells in which p53 is mutated or inactive. Despite the great importance of p73-induced apoptosis in cancer therapy, little is known about the molecular basis of p73-induced apoptosis. In this review, we discuss the p73 structures reported to date, detailed structural comparisons between p73 and p53, and current understanding of the transcription-dependent and -independent mechanisms of p73-induced apoptosis.
26245666	Sublethal dose of irradiation enhances invasion of malignant glioma cells through p53-MMP 2 pathway in U87MG mouse brain tumor model.	Pei J, Park IH, Ryu HH, Li SY, Li CH, Lim SH, Wen M, Jang WY, Jung S.	BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is a highly lethal neoplasm that frequently recurs locally after radiotherapy, and most of these recurrences originate from near the irradiated target field. In the present study, we identified the effects of radiation on glioma invasion and p53, TIMP-2, and MMP-2 expression through in vitro and in vivo experiments. METHODS: The U87MG (wt p53) and U251 (mt p53) human malignant glioma cell lines were prepared, and the U2OS (wt 53) and Saos2 (del p53) osteosarcoma cell lines were used as p53 positive and negative controls. The four cell lines and p53 knock-downed U87MG cells received radiation (2-6 Gy) and were analyzed for expression of p53 and TIMP-2 by Western blot, and MMP-2 activity was detected by zymography. In addition, the effects of irradiation on directional invasion of malignant glioma were evaluated by implanting nude mice with bioluminescent u87-Fluc in vivo followed by MMP-2, p53, and TIMP-2 immunohisto-chemistry and in situ zymography. RESULTS: MMP-2 activity and p53 expression increased in proportional to the radiation dose in cell lines with wt p53, but not in the cell lines with del or mt p53. TIMP-2 expression did not increase in U87MG cells. MMP-2 activity decreased in p53 knock-downed U87MG cells but increased in the control group. Furthermore, radiation enhanced MMP-2 activity and increased tumor margin invasiveness in vivo. Tumor cells invaded by radiation overexpressed MMP-2 and p53 and revealed high gelatinolytic activity compared with those of non-radiated tumor cells. CONCLUSION: Radiation-induced upregulation of p53 modulated MMP-2 activity, and the imbalance between MMP-2 and TIMP-2 may have an important role in glioblastoma invasion by degrading the extracellular matrix. Bioluminescent "U87-Fluc"was useful for observing tumor formation without sacrifice after implanting tumor cells in the mouse brain. These findings suggest that the radiotherapy involved field for malignant glioma needs to be reconsidered, and that future trials should investigate concurrent pharmacologic therapies that inhibit invasion associated with radiotherapy.
26190111	Systemic Akt1 Deletion after Tumor Onset in p53(-/-) Mice Increases Lifespan and Regresses Thymic Lymphoma Emulating p53 Restoration.	Yu WN, Nogueira V, Sobhakumari A, Patra KC, Bhaskar PT, Hay N.	Akt is frequently activated in human cancers. However, it is unknown whether systemic inhibition of a single Akt isoform could regress cancer progression in cancers that are not driven by Akt activation. We systemically deleted Akt1 after tumor onset in p53(-/-) mice, which develop tumors independently of Akt activation. Systemic Akt1 deletion regresses thymic lymphoma in p53(-/-) mice emulating p53 restoration. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of Akt selectively kills thymic lymphoma cells and not primary thymocytes. Mechanistically, Akt1 inhibition in p53(-/-) thymic lymphoma inhibits Skp2 expression and induces FasL, which is the primary cause of cell death. Skp2 exerts resistance to cell death by antagonizing the induction of FasL and reducing FAS expression, which is linked to cyclin D1 expression. The results established a paradigm whereby systemic Akt1 inhibition is sufficient to regress tumors that are not driven by Akt activation and a mechanism of cell survival by Skp2.
25569532	Interactions of chromatin context, binding site sequence content, and sequence evolution in stress-induced p53 occupancy and transactivation.	Su D, Wang X, Campbell MR, Song L, Safi A, Crawford GE, Bell DA.	Cellular stresses activate the tumor suppressor p53 protein leading to selective binding to DNA response elements (REs) and gene transactivation from a large pool of potential p53 REs (p53REs). To elucidate how p53RE sequences and local chromatin context interact to affect p53 binding and gene transactivation, we mapped genome-wide binding localizations of p53 and H3K4me3 in untreated and doxorubicin (DXR)-treated human lymphoblastoid cells. We examined the relationships among p53 occupancy, gene expression, H3K4me3, chromatin accessibility (DNase 1 hypersensitivity, DHS), ENCODE chromatin states, p53RE sequence, and evolutionary conservation. We observed that the inducible expression of p53-regulated genes was associated with the steady-state chromatin status of the cell. Most highly inducible p53-regulated genes were suppressed at baseline and marked by repressive histone modifications or displayed CTCF binding. Comparison of p53RE sequences residing in different chromatin contexts demonstrated that weaker p53REs resided in open promoters, while stronger p53REs were located within enhancers and repressed chromatin. p53 occupancy was strongly correlated with similarity of the target DNA sequences to the p53RE consensus, but surprisingly, inversely correlated with pre-existing nucleosome accessibility (DHS) and evolutionary conservation at the p53RE. Occupancy by p53 of REs that overlapped transposable element (TE) repeats was significantly higher (p<10-7) and correlated with stronger p53RE sequences (p<10-110) relative to nonTE-associated p53REs, particularly for MLT1H, LTR10B, and Mer61 TEs. However, binding at these elements was generally not associated with transactivation of adjacent genes. Occupied p53REs located in L2-like TEs were unique in displaying highly negative PhyloP scores (predicted fast-evolving) and being associated with altered H3K4me3 and DHS levels. These results underscore the systematic interaction between chromatin status and p53RE context in the induced transactivation response. This p53 regulated response appears to have been tuned via evolutionary processes that may have led to repression and/or utilization of p53REs originating from primate-specific transposon elements.
25932465	Genetic background influences loss of heterozygosity patterns in radiation-induced mouse thymic lymphoma.	Hang M, Huang Y, Snijders AM, Mao JH.	Previous studies have revealed that p53 heterozygous (p53+/-) mice are extremely susceptible to radiation-induced tumorigenesis. To investigate whether genetic background influences radiation induced tumor susceptibility, we crossed p53+/- 129/Sv mice with genetically diverse strains to generate p53+/- F1 hybrids. The results showed that genetic background had a profound impact on tumor latency after exposure to gamma radiation, while the tumor spectrum did not change. We further characterized the thymic lymphomas that arose in the p53+/- mice by genome-wide loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analyses and found that genetic background strongly influenced the frequency of LOH and the loss of which parental allele on different chromosomes. Further research is needed to identify which genetic variations control the LOH patterns in radiation-induced thymic lymphomas and to evaluate its relevance to human cancers.
25884692	Prognostic role of serum p53 antibodies in lung cancer.	Mattioni M, Soddu S, Prodosmo A, Visca P, Conti S, Alessandrini G, Facciolo F, Strigari L.	BACKGROUND: Mutations in the TP53 (Tumour Protein 53) gene can lead to expression of mutant p53 proteins that accumulate in cancer cells and can induce circulating p53 antibodies in cancer patients. Our aim was to evaluate the presence and prognostic role of these antibodies in lung cancer patients and to investigate whether they were related to p53 expression or TP53 mutations in tumour tissues. METHODS: A total of 201 lung cancer patients were evaluated for p53 antibodies by ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) and control was obtained from 54 patients with non-malignant disorders; p53 expression was evaluated in 131 of the lung cancer patients by immunohistochemistry and TP53 mutations were then investigated in 53 tumours positively staining for p53 and in 12 tumours without p53 overexpression, whose DNA was available for direct sequencing. RESULTS: Our results show that 20.4% of cancer patients have positive levels of p53 antibodies, while none of the controls resulted positive. High levels of p53 expression are detected in 57.3% of cases and a significant correlation between serum p53 antibodies and high levels of p53 expression in the corresponding tumours is observed. In non-small cell lung cancer, p53 antibodies are significantly associated with poorly differentiated tumours; furthermore, high levels of p53 expression significantly correlated with squamous cell carcinoma and tumours with highest grade. Survival time of non-small cell lung cancer patients low/negative for serum p53 antibodies was significantly longer compared to patients with positive levels (p = 0.049); in particular, patients with squamous cell carcinoma, but not adenocarcinoma, low/negative for these antibodies show a significant better survival compared to serum-positive patients (p = 0.044). CONCLUSIONS: In our study, detection of serum p53 antibodies in non-small cell lung cancer patients has been shown to be useful in identifying subsets of patients with poor prognosis. A significant correlation between the presence of serum p53 antibodies in lung cancer patients and p53 overexpression in the corresponding tumours was also observed. We did not find a significant correlation between levels of serum p53 antibodies and TP53 mutations in the corresponding tumours.
25844354	Ki-67 and p53 expression as a predictive marker for early postoperative recurrence in pancreatic head cancer.	Kim H, Park CY, Lee JH, Kim JC, Cho CK, Kim HJ.	PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the clinical significance of Ki-67 and p53 expressions in patients with pancreatic head cancer. METHODS: Between May 2008 and April 2013, immunohistochemical staining for Ki-67 and p53 was performed in 34 patients with pancreatic head cancer (ductal adenocarcinoma). All 34 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy at Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea. Clinical and histopathological characteristics were analyzed, relative to p53 expression. RESULTS: Thirty (88.2%) and twenty-one (61.7%) of the 34 pancreatic head cancers exhibited positive expression of Ki-67 and p53, respectively. Patients expressing Ki-67 and p53 experienced more frequent tumor recurrences within 1 year after surgical resection (P = 0.003 and P = 0.030, respectively). However, no correlation was detected between Ki-67 and p53 expression. Ki-67 expression was correlated with pathological grade, lymph node metasatsis, and clinical stage (P < 0.05). Importantly, Ki-67 was the independent predictive factor for postoperative recurrence within 1 year in both univariable and multivariable analyses (odds ratio, 27.219; 95% confidence interval, 1.403-528.135; P = 0.029). CONCLUSION: The expression of Ki-67 and p53 are significantly related to early postoperative recurrence within 1 year after surgical resection in pancreatic head cancer. Especially, Ki-67 was the independent predictive factor for postoperative recurrence within 1 year. Therefore, immunohistochemical staining for Ki-67 and p53 may be applied as a predictive marker for early postoperative recurrence in pancreatic head cancer.
25645925	MicroRNA 155 control of p53 activity is context dependent and mediated by Aicda and Socs1.	Bouamar H, Jiang D, Wang L, Lin AP, Ortega M, Aguiar RC.	In biological processes, the balance between positive and negative inputs is critical for an effective physiological response and to prevent disease. A case in point is the germinal center (GC) reaction, wherein high mutational and proliferation rates are accompanied by an obligatory suppression of the DNA repair machinery. Understandably, when the GC reaction goes awry, loss of immune cells or lymphoid cancer ensues. Here, we detail the functional interactions that make microRNA 155 (miR-155) a key part of this process. Upon antigen exposure, miR-155(-/-) mature B cells displayed significantly higher double-strand DNA break (DSB) accumulation and p53 activation than their miR-155(+/+) counterparts. Using B cell-specific knockdown strategies, we confirmed the role of the miR-155 target Aicda (activation-induced cytidine deaminase) in this process and, in combination with a gain-of-function model, unveiled a previously unappreciated role for Socs1 in directly modulating p53 activity and the DNA damage response in B lymphocytes. Thus, miR-155 controls the outcome of the GC reaction by modulating its initiation (Aicda) and termination (Socs1/p53 response), suggesting a mechanism to explain the quantitative defect in germinal center B cells found in mice lacking or overexpressing this miRNA.
26075823	Death-associated protein kinase 1 promotes growth of p53-mutant cancers.	Zhao J, Zhao D, Poage GM, Mazumdar A, Zhang Y, Hill JL, Hartman ZC, Savage MI, Mills GB, Brown PH.	Estrogen receptor-negative (ER-negative) breast cancers are extremely aggressive and associated with poor prognosis. In particular, effective treatment strategies are limited for patients diagnosed with triple receptor-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which also carries the worst prognosis of all forms of breast cancer; therefore, extensive studies have focused on the identification of molecularly targeted therapies for this tumor subtype. Here, we sought to identify molecular targets that are capable of suppressing tumorigenesis in TNBCs. Specifically, we found that death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) is essential for growth of p53-mutant cancers, which account for over 80% of TNBCs. Depletion or inhibition of DAPK1 suppressed growth of p53-mutant but not p53-WT breast cancer cells. Moreover, DAPK1 inhibition limited growth of other p53-mutant cancers, including pancreatic and ovarian cancers. DAPK1 mediated the disruption of the TSC1/TSC2 complex, resulting in activation of the mTOR pathway. Our studies demonstrated that high DAPK1 expression causes increased cancer cell growth and enhanced signaling through the mTOR/S6K pathway; evaluation of multiple breast cancer patient data sets revealed that high DAPK1 expression associates with worse outcomes in individuals with p53-mutant cancers. Together, our data support targeting DAPK1 as a potential therapeutic strategy for p53-mutant cancers.
26189367	Interleukin-13 interferes with activation-induced t-cell apoptosis by repressing p53 expression.	Yang L, Xu LZ, Liu ZQ, Yang G, Geng XR, Mo LH, Liu ZG, Zheng PY, Yang PC.	The etiology and the underlying mechanism of CD4(+) T-cell polarization are unclear. This study sought to investigate the mechanism by which interleukin (IL)-13 prevents the activation-induced apoptosis of CD4(+) T cells. Here we report that CD4(+) T cells expressed IL-13 receptor α2 in the intestine of sensitized mice. IL-13 suppressed both the activation-induced apoptosis of CD4(+) T cells and the expression of p53 and FasL. Exposure to recombinant IL-13 inhibited activation-induced cell death (AICD) along with the expression of p53, caspase 3, and tumor necrosis factor-α in CD4(+) T cells. Administration of an anti-IL-13 antibody enhanced the effect of specific immunotherapy on allergic inflammation in the mouse intestine, enforced the expression of p53 in intestinal CD4(+) T cells, and enhanced the frequency of CD4(+) T-cell apoptosis upon challenge with specific antigens. In summary, blocking IL-13 enhances the therapeutic effect of antigen-specific immunotherapy by regulating apoptosis and thereby enforcing AICD in CD4(+) T cells.Cellular & Molecular Immunology advance online publication, 20 July 2015; doi:10.1038/cmi2015.50.
26200049	EGFR, p53, IDH-1 and MDM2 immunohistochemical analysis in glioblastoma: therapeutic and prognostic correlation.	Montgomery RM, Queiroz Lde S, Rogerio F.	We studied 36 glioblastoma cases at HC-UNICAMP from 2008 to 2012 and classified the immunohistochemical distribution of the wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), mutated forms of p53 protein and isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH-1) and murine double protein 2 (MDM2). Immunostaining findings were correlated with clinical data and response to treatment (surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy). About 97% of the tumors were primary, most of them localized in the frontal lobe. Mean time free of clinical or symptomatic disease and free time of radiological disease were 7.56 and 7.14 months, respectively. We observed a significant positive correlation between expressions of p53 and MDM2, EGFR and MDM2. Clinical, radiological and overall survivals also showed a significant positive correlation. p53 staining and clinical survival showed a significant negative correlation. The current series provides clinical and histopathological data that contribute to knowledge on glioblastoma in Brazilians.
24406212	p53 orchestrates between normal differentiation and cancer.	Rivlin N, Koifman G, Rotter V.	During recent years, it is becoming more and more evident that there is a tight connection between abnormal differentiation processes and cancer. While cancer and stem cells are very different, especially in terms of maintaining genomic integrity, these cell types also share many similar properties. In this review, we aim to provide an over-view of the roles of the key tumor suppressor, p53, in regulating normal differentiation and function of both stem cells and adult cells. When these functions are disrupted, undifferentiated cells may become transformed. Understanding the function of p53 in stem cells and its role in maintaining the balance between differentiation and malignant transformation can help shed light on cancer initiation and propagation, and hopefully also on cancer prevention and therapy.
25925024	SMIFH2 has effects on Formins and p53 that perturb the cell cytoskeleton.	Isogai T, van der Kammen R, Innocenti M.	Formin proteins are key regulators of the cytoskeleton involved in developmental and homeostatic programs, and human disease. For these reasons, small molecules interfering with Formins' activity have gained increasing attention. Among them, small molecule inhibitor of Formin Homology 2 domains (SMIFH2) is often used as a pharmacological Formin blocker. Although SMIFH2 inhibits actin polymerization by Formins and affects the actin cytoskeleton, its cellular mechanism of action and target specificity remain unclear. Here we show that SMIFH2 induces remodelling of actin filaments, microtubules and the Golgi complex as a result of its effects on Formins and p53. We found that SMIFH2 triggers alternated depolymerization-repolymerization cycles of actin and tubulin, increases cell migration, causes scattering of the Golgi complex, and also cytotoxicity at high dose. Moreover, SMIFH2 reduces expression and activity of p53 through a post-transcriptional, proteasome-independent mechanism that influences remodelling of the cytoskeleton. As the action of SMIFH2 may go beyond Formin inhibition, only short-term and low-dose SMIFH2 treatments minimize confounding effects induced by loss of p53 and cytotoxicity.
26016020	[Influence of silver and titanium dioxide nanoparticles on the expression of genes of biomarkers of inflammatory responses and apoptosis].	Baranova LA, Zhornik EV, Volotovski ID.	In order to evaluate the toxic effect of silver (AgNP) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles their influence on the expression of genes of biomarkers of inflammatory responses and apoptosis in human lymphocytes was studied. An increase in the IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α and p53 genes expression in the concentration range of silver and titanium dioxide nanoparticles of 10-40 μk g/ml was found. Increased expression of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α and p53 genes under the nanoparticles action indicates the stimulation of the immune system and of apoptosis, respectively.
25359126	The Apoptotic Effect of Plant Based Nanosilver in Colon Cancer Cells is a p53 Dependent Process Involving ROS and JNK Cascade.	Satapathy SR, Mohapatra P, Das D, Siddharth S, Kundu CN.	Here, we report the p53 dependent mitochondria-mediated apoptotic mechanism of plant derived silver-nanoparticle (PD-AgNPs) in colorectal cancer cells (CRCs). PD-AgNPs was synthesized by reduction of AgNO3 with leaf extract of a medicinal plant periwinkle and characterized. Uptake of PD-AgNPs (ξ - 2.52 ± 4.31 mV) in HCT116 cells was 3 fold higher in comparison to synthetic AgNPs (ξ +2.293 ± 5.1 mV). A dose dependent increase in ROS production, activated JNK and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were noted in HCT116 but not in HCT116 p53(-/-) cells after PD-AgNP exposure. PD-AgNP-mediated apoptosis in CRCs is a p53 dependent process involving ROS and JNK cascade.
26471002	Histone methyltransferase SETDB1 regulates liver cancer cell growth through methylation of p53.	Fei Q, Shang K, Zhang J, Chuai S, Kong D, Zhou T, Fu S, Liang Y, Li C, Chen Z, Zhao Y, Yu Z, Huang Z, Hu M, Ying H, Chen Z, Zhang Y, Xing F, Zhu J, Xu H, Zhao K, Lu C, Atadja P, Xiao ZX, Li E, Shou J.	SETDB1 is a histone H3K9 methyltransferase that has a critical role in early development. It is located within a melanoma susceptibility locus and facilitates melanoma formation. However, the mechanism by which SETDB1 regulates tumorigenesis remains unknown. Here we report the molecular interplay between SETDB1 and the well-known hotspot gain-of-function (GOF) TP53 R249S mutation. We show that in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) SETDB1 is overexpressed with moderate copy number gain, and GOF TP53 mutations including R249S associate with this overexpression. Inactivation of SETDB1 in HCC cell lines bearing the R249S mutation suppresses cell growth. The TP53 mutation status renders cancer cells dependent on SETDB1. Moreover, SETDB1 forms a complex with p53 and catalyses p53K370 di-methylation. SETDB1 attenuation reduces the p53K370me2 level, which subsequently leads to increased recognition and degradation of p53 by MDM2. Together, we provide both genetic and biochemical evidence for a mechanism by which SETDB1 regulates cancer cell growth via methylation of p53.
26468276	Hypoxia inhibits myogenic differentiation through p53-dependent induction of Bhlhe40.	Wang C, Liu W, Liu Z, Chen L, Liu X, Kuang S.	Satellite cells are muscle resident stem cells capable of self-renewal and differentiation to repair injured muscles. However, muscle injury often leads to an ischemic hypoxia environment that impedes satellite cell differentiation and reduces the efficiency of muscle regeneration. Here, we performed microarray analysis and identified the basic Helix-Loop-Helix family transcription factor Bhlhe40 as a candidate mediator of the myogenic inhibitory effect of hypoxia. Bhlhe40 is strongly induced by hypoxia in satellite cell-derived primary myoblasts. Overexpression of Bhlhe40 inhibits Myogenin expression and mimics the effect of hypoxia on myogenesis. Inhibition of Bhlhe40 conversely upregulates Myogenin expression and promotes myogenic differentiation. Importantly, Bhlhe40 knockdown rescues myogenic differentiation under hypoxia. Mechanistically, Bhlhe40 binds to the proximal E-boxes of Myogenin promoter and reduces the binding affinity and transcriptional activity of MyoD on Myogenin. Interestingly, hypoxia induces Bhlhe40 expression independent of HIF1α, but through a novel p53-dependent signaling pathway. Together, our study establishes a crucial role of Bhlhe40 in mediating the repressive effect of hypoxia on myogenic differentiation and suggests that inhibition of Bhlhe40 or p53 may facilitate muscle regeneration after ischemic injuries.
26078718	NQO1 Stabilizes p53 in Response to Oncogene-Induced Senescence.	Liu K, Jin B, Wu C, Yang J, Zhan X, Wang L, Shen X, Chen J, Chen H, Mao Z.	Cellular senescence is a state of permanent cellular arrest that provides an initial barrier to cell transformation and tumorigenesis. In this study, we report that expression ofquinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), a cytoplasmic 2-electron reductase, is induced during oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). Depletion of NQO1 resulted in the delayed onset of senescence. In contrast, ectopic expression of NQO1 enhanced the senescence phenotype. Analysis of the mechanism underlying the up-regulation of NQO1 expression during senescence identified that NQO1 promotes p53 accumulation in an MDM2 and ubiquitin independent manner, which reinforces the cellular senescence phenotype. Specifically, we demonstrated that NRF2/KEAP1 signaling regulates NQO1 expression during OIS. More importantly, we confirmed that depletion of NQO1 facilitates cell transformation and tumorigenesis, which indicates that NQO1 takes part in the senescence barrier and has anti-oncogenic properties in cell transformation.
25636474	Methods to generate genetically engineered mouse models of soft tissue sarcoma.	Dodd RD, Añó L, Blum JM, Li Z, Van Mater D, Kirsch DG.	We discuss the generation of primary soft tissue sarcomas in mice using the Cre-loxP system to activate conditional mutations in oncogenic Kras and the tumor suppressor p53 (LSL-Kras(G12D/+); p53(flox/flox)). Sarcomas can be generated either by adenoviral delivery of Cre recombinase, activation of transgenic Cre recombinase with tamoxifen, or through transplantation of isolated satellite cells with Cre activation in vitro. Various applications of these models are discussed, including anticancer therapies, metastasis, in vivo imaging, and genetic requirements for tumorigenesis.
26497681	Suppression of ATAD2 inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma progression through activation of p53- and p38-mediated apoptotic signaling.	Lu WJ, Chua MS, So SK.	The ATPase family, AAA domain containing 2 (ATAD2) is highly expressed in multiple cancers. We aim to understand the clinical and biological significance of ATAD2 over-expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as a means to validate it as a therapeutic target in HCC. We demonstrated that ATAD2 was over-expressed in HCC patients, where high ATAD2 levels were significantly correlated with aggressive phenotypes such as high AFP levels, advanced tumor stages, and vascular invasion. Using RNA interference, suppression of ATAD2 in HCC cell lines decreased cell viability, migration, and invasion, and induced apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, we identified p53 and p38 as key proteins that mediate apoptosis induced by ATAD2 suppression. In HCC cells, we demonstrated that ATAD2 directly interacted with MKK3/6, which prevented p38 activation and therefore inhibited p38-mediated apoptosis. In vivo, suppression of ATAD2 impaired the growth of HepG2 and Hep3B subcutaneous xenografts, accompanied by enhanced apoptosis and p-p53 and p-p38 levels. Our results validate that ATAD2 is an important negative regulator of apoptosis, and that neutralizing its activity has promising anti-tumor effects in HCC cells.
25486431	Antitumor mechanisms when pRb and p53 are genetically inactivated.	Zhu L, Lu Z, Zhao H.	pRb and p53 are the two major tumor suppressors. Their inactivation is frequent when cancers develop and their reactivation is rationale of most cancer therapeutics. When pRb and p53 are genetically inactivated, cells irreparably lose the antitumor mechanisms afforded by them. Cancer genome studies document recurrent genetic inactivation of RB1 and TP53, and the inactivation becomes more frequent in more advanced cancers. These findings may explain why more advanced cancers are more likely to resist current therapies. Finding successful treatments for more advanced and multi-therapy-resistant cancers will depend on finding antitumor mechanisms that remain effective when pRb and p53 are genetically inactivated. Here, we review studies that have begun to make progress in this direction.
26189498	A Thiol-Ene Coupling Approach to Native Peptide Stapling and Macrocyclization.	Wang Y, Chou DH.	We report the discovery of a peptide stapling and macrocyclization method using thiol-ene reactions between two cysteine residues and an α,ω-diene in high yields. This new approach enabled us to selectively modify cysteine residues in native, unprotected peptides with a variety of stapling modifications for helix stabilization or general macrocyclization. We synthesized stapled Axin mimetic analogues and demonstrated increased alpha helicity upon peptide stapling. We then synthesized stapled p53 mimetic analogues using pure hydrocarbon linkers and demonstrated their abilities to block the p53-MDM2 interaction and selectively kill p53 wild-type colorectal carcinoma HCT-116 cells but not p53 null cells. In summary, we demonstrated a robust and versatile peptide stapling method that could be potentially applied to both synthetic and expressed peptides.
26181851	Discovery of a Dihydroisoquinolinone Derivative (NVP-CGM097): A Highly Potent and Selective MDM2 Inhibitor Undergoing Phase 1 Clinical Trials in p53wt Tumors.	Holzer P, Masuya K, Furet P, Kallen J, Valat-Stachyra T, Ferretti S, Berghausen J, Bouisset-Leonard M, Buschmann N, Pissot-Soldermann C, Rynn C, Ruetz S, Stutz S, Chène P, Jeay S, Gessier F.	As a result of our efforts to discover novel p53:MDM2 protein-protein interaction inhibitors useful for treating cancer, the potent and selective MDM2 inhibitor NVP-CGM097 (1) with an excellent in vivo profile was selected as a clinical candidate and is currently in phase 1 clinical development. This article provides an overview of the discovery of this new clinical p53:MDM2 inhibitor. The following aspects are addressed: mechanism of action, scientific rationale, binding mode, medicinal chemistry, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, and in vivo pharmacology/toxicology in preclinical species.
26595384	Transient PLK4 overexpression accelerates tumorigenesis in p53-deficient epidermis.	Serçin Ö, Larsimont JC, Karambelas AE, Marthiens V, Moers V, Boeckx B, Le Mercier M, Lambrechts D, Basto R, Blanpain C.	Aneuploidy is found in most solid tumours, but it remains unclear whether it is the cause or the consequence of tumorigenesis. Using Plk4 overexpression (PLK4OE) during epidermal development, we assess the impact of centrosome amplification and aneuploidy on skin development and tumorigenesis. PLK4OE in the developing epidermis induced centrosome amplification and multipolar divisions, leading to p53 stabilization and apoptosis of epidermal progenitors. The resulting delayed epidermal stratification led to skin barrier defects. Plk4 transgene expression was shut down postnatally in the surviving mice and PLK4OE mice never developed skin tumours. Concomitant PLK4OE and p53 deletion (PLK4OE/p53cKO) rescued the differentiation defects, but did not prevent the apoptosis of PLK4OE cells. Remarkably, the short-term presence of cells with supernumerary centrosomes in PLK4OE/p53cKO mice was sufficient to generate aneuploidy in the adult epidermis and triggered spontaneous skin cancers with complete penetrance. These results reveal that aneuploidy induced by transient centrosome amplification can accelerate tumorigenesis in p53-deficient cells.
26295305	Non genomic loss of function of tumor suppressors in CML: BCR-ABL promotes IκBα mediated p53 nuclear exclusion.	Crivellaro S, Panuzzo C, Carrà G, Volpengo A, Crasto F, Gottardi E, Familiari U, Papotti M, Torti D, Piazza R, Redaelli S, Taulli R, Guerrasio A, Saglio G, Morotti A.	Tumor suppressor function can be modulated by subtle variation of expression levels, proper cellular compartmentalization and post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, acetylation and sumoylation. The non-genomic loss of function of tumor suppressors offers a challenging therapeutic opportunity. The reactivation of a tumor suppressor could indeed promote selective apoptosis of cancer cells without affecting normal cells. The identification of mechanisms that affect tumor suppressor functions is therefore essential. In this work, we show that BCR-ABL promotes the accumulation of the NFKBIA gene product, IκBα, in the cytosol through physical interaction and stabilization of the protein. Furthermore, BCR-ABL/IκBα complex acts as a scaffold protein favoring p53 nuclear exclusion. We therefore identify a novel BCR-ABL/IκBα/p53 network, whereby BCR-ABL functionally inactivates a key tumor suppressor.
25860929	FBXW7-mutated colorectal cancer cells exhibit aberrant expression of phosphorylated-p53 at Serine-15.	Li N, Lorenzi F, Kalakouti E, Normatova M, Babaei-Jadidi R, Tomlinson I, Nateri AS.	FBXW7 mutations occur in a variety of human cancers including colorectal cancer (CRC). Elucidating its mechanism of action has become crucial for cancer therapy; however, it is also complicated by the fact that FBXW7 can influence many pathways due to its role as an E3-ubiquitin ligase in proteasome degradation. FBXW7 and TP53 are tumour suppressors intensively implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis. Deletion mutations in these two genes in animal models mark the progression from adenoma to carcinoma. Although still largely unknown, the last defense mechanism against CRC at the molecular level could be through a synergistic effect of the two genes. The underlying mechanism requires further investigation. In our laboratory, we have used a phospho-kinase profiler array to illustrate a potential molecular link between FBXW7 and p53 in CRC cells. In vitro and in vivo assessments demonstrated aberrant induction of phosphorylated p53 at Serine 15 [phospho-p53(Ser15)] in human FBXW7-deficient CRC cells as compared to their FBXW7-wild-type counterparts. FBXW7 loss in HCT116 cells promoted resistance to oxaliplatin. Immunoblotting data further confirmed that reduction of phospho-p53(Ser15) may contribute to the decreased efficacy of therapy in FBXW7-mutated CRC cells. The findings may suggest the applicability of phospho-p53(Ser15) as an indicative marker of FBXW7-mutations. Phospho-p53(Ser15) regulation by FBXW7 E3-ligase activity could provide important clues for understanding FBXW7 behavior in tumour progression and grounds for its clinical applicability thereafter.
26122228	BERBERIS VULGARIS FRUIT CRUDE EXTRACT AS A NOVEL ANTI-LEUKAEMIC AGENT.	Saedi TA, Ghafourian S, Jafarlou M, Sabariah MN, Ismail P, Eusni RM, Othman F.	Tumor protein p53 encoded by the TP53 gene in humans is known as a cancer biomarker in patients diagnosed with cancer, and it plays an essential role in apoptosis, genomic stability, and inhibition of angiogenesis. Cancer therapies with common chemotherapy methods are effective, as known, but have some side effects. Berberis vulgaris is traditionally administrated as a cancer drug. The current research aims to evaluate p53 as a biomarker in WEHI-3 cell line and to demonstrate the Berberis vulgaris fruit crude extract (BVFCE) as a new anticancer drug. For this purpose, we evaluated the effect of BVFCE in different concentrations against WEHI-3cell line in vitro and determined the quantitative level of p53 gene in the treated WEHI-3 cells. The results demonstrated that even at only 1 mg/ml concentration of Berberis vulgaris crude extract, there was a low level of p53 biomarker expression on WEHI-3 cells in comparison with doxorubicin. Therefore, the current study suggests BVFCE as a reliable anti-leukaemic drug and candidate for anticancer therapy. However, further investigation need be carried out to confirm its efficiency in vivo.
26124267	Expression of Apoptotic vs Antiapoptotic Proteins in Middle Ear Cholesteatoma.	Chung JH, Lee SH, Park CW, Kim KR, Tae K, Kang SH, Oh YH, Pyo JY.	OBJECTIVES: To explore the role of antiapoptotic and apoptotic processes in the development of cholesteatoma by investigating the expression of an antiapoptotic (c-FLIP) and apoptotic (p53) protein relative to the expression of a proliferation marker (Ki-67). STUDY DESIGN: Basic science study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: An immunohistochemical investigation was performed on 35 cholesteatoma specimens (21 acquired, 14 congenital) and 10 normal retroauricular skins to evaluate the expression of c-FLIP, p53, and Ki-67. The expression rate of each marker was measured to assess the difference between retroauricular skin and cholesteatoma, as well as between congenital and acquired cholesteatoma. RESULTS: c-FLIP expression was significantly higher in the cholesteatoma specimens than in retroauricular skin (P < .05), while the expression of p53 did not significantly differ between the two. Ki-67 expression in cholesteatoma was significantly higher than in retroauricular skin (P < .001). The c-FLIP expression rate was positively correlated with that of Ki-67 (r = 0.47, P = .001), and there was no significant correlation between the expression level of p53 and that of Ki-67 (r = 0.152, P = .319). In addition, no differences in c-FLIP, p53, and Ki-67 expression rates were evident between congenital and acquired cholesteatoma. CONCLUSIONS: The upregulation of c-FLIP together with unchanged p53 suggests an altered equilibrium between apoptosis and antiapoptosis, favoring antiapoptosis, and may play a role in the pathogenesis of cholesteatoma.
26168827	Evaluation of Intraductal Ultrasonography, Endoscopic Brush Cytology and K-ras, P53 Gene Mutation in the Early Diagnosis of Malignant Bile Duct Stricture.	Huang P, Zhang H, Zhang XF, Zhang X, Lyu W, Fan Z.	BACKGROUND: In qualitative diagnosis of bile duct stenosis, single diagnostic measure is difficult to make a correct diagnosis, to combine several diagnostic techniques may be helpful to make an accurate diagnosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of intraductal ultrasonography (IDUS), endoscopic brush cytology and K-ras, P53 gene mutation in the early diagnosis of malignant biliary stricture. METHODS: From February 2012 to February 2013, 84 patients with suspected malignant biliary stricture were performed IDUS firstly, then endoscopic brush cytology and finally K-ras, P53 gene mutation detection, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of all above ways were evaluated and compared. RESULTS: Of 84 patients, 52 cases were ultimately diagnosed malignant biliary stenosis; of which, 9 cases had no recurrence or metastasis to other organs after radical operation during the follow-up period. IDUS combined with brush cytology and K-ras + P53 gene mutation detection had obvious advantage in the sensitivity, accuracy and negative predictive value than any other joint detection and single detection (the advantage was more significant compared with IDUS + brush cytology or any single detection P < 0.01). There were obvious statistical significance in the sensitivity and accuracy between IDUS + brush cytology + P53 or IDUS + brush cytology + K-ras and IDUS + brush cytology or IDUS (P < 0.05). There was no statistical significance in the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy between IDUS + brush cytology + P53 and IDUS + brush cytology + K-ras (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: IDUS combined with brush cytology and K-ras, P53 gene mutation detection is better than the separate detection and contribute to the early diagnosis of malignant biliary stricture. Its more widespread use is recommended.
26174856	The amyloid precursor protein (APP) intracellular domain regulates translation of p44, a short isoform of p53, through an IRES-dependent mechanism.	Li M, Pehar M, Liu Y, Bhattacharyya A, Zhang SC, O'Riordan KJ, Burger C, D'Adamio L, Puglielli L.	p44 is a short isoform of the tumor suppressor protein p53 that is regulated in an age-dependent manner. When overexpressed in the mouse, it causes a progeroid phenotype that includes premature cognitive decline, synaptic defects, and hyperphosphorylation of tau. The hyperphosphorylation of tau has recently been linked to the ability of p44 to regulate transcription of relevant tau kinases. Here, we report that the amyloid precursor protein (APP) intracellular domain (AICD), which results from the processing of the APP, regulates translation of p44 through a cap-independent mechanism that requires direct binding to the second internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of the p53 mRNA. We also report that AICD associates with nucleolin, an already known IRES-specific trans-acting factor that binds with p53 IRES elements and regulates translation of p53 isoforms. The potential biological impact of our findings was assessed in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. In conclusion, our study reveals a novel aspect of AICD and p53/p44 biology and provides a possible molecular link between APP, p44, and tau.
26335255	Metabolic activation of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine and DNA adduct formation depends on p53: studies in Trp53(+/+), Trp53(+/-) and Trp53(-/-) mice.	Krais AM, Speksnijder EN, Melis JP, Singh R, Caldwell A, Gamboa da Costa G, Luijten M, Phillips DH, Arlt VM.	The expression of the tumour suppressor p53 can influence the bioactivation of, and DNA damage induced by, the environmental carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene, indicating a role for p53 in its cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated biotransformation. The carcinogen 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), which is formed during the cooking of food, is also metabolically activated by CYP enzymes, particularly CYP1A2. We investigated the potential role of p53 in PhIP metabolism in vivo by treating Trp53(+/+), Trp53(+/-) and Trp53(-/-) mice with a single oral dose of 50 mg/kg body weight PhIP. N-(Deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP-C8-dG) levels in DNA, measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, were significantly lower in liver, colon, forestomach and glandular stomach of Trp53(-/-) mice compared to Trp53(+/+) mice. Lower PhIP-DNA adduct levels in the livers of Trp53(-/-) mice correlated with lower Cyp1a2 enzyme activity (measured by methoxyresorufin-O-demethylase activity) in these animals. Interestingly, PhIP-DNA adduct levels were significantly higher in kidney and bladder of Trp53(-/-) mice compared to Trp53(+/+) mice, which was accompanied by higher sulfotransferase (Sult) 1a1 protein levels and increased Sult1a1 enzyme activity (measured by 2-naphthylsulfate formation from 2-naphthol) in kidneys of these animals. Our study demonstrates a role for p53 in the metabolism of PhIP in vivo, extending previous results on a novel role for p53 in xenobiotic metabolism. Our results also indicate that the impact of p53 on PhIP biotransformation is tissue-dependent and that in addition to Cyp1a enzymes, Sult1a1 can contribute to PhIP-DNA adduct formation.

24798519	Gallotannin is a DNA damaging compound that induces senescence independently of p53 and p21 in human colon cancer cells.	Al-Halabi R, Abou Merhi R, Chakilam S, El-Baba C, Hamade E, Di Fazio P, Ocker M, Schneider-Stock R, Gali-Muhtasib H.	The plant secondary metabolite gallotannin (GT) is the simplest hydrolyzable tannin shown to have anti-carcinogenic properties in several cell lines and to inhibit tumor development in different animal models. Here, we determined if GT induces senescence and DNA damage and investigated the involvement of p53 and p21 in this response. Using HCT116 human colon cancer cells wildtype for p53(+/+) /p21(+/+) and null for p53(+/+) /p21(-/-) or p53(-/-) /p21(+/+) , we found that GT induces senescence independently of p21 and p53. GT was found to increase the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by altering the redox balance in the cell, mainly by reducing the levels of glutathione and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Using the key antioxidants N-acetyl cysteine, dithiothreitol, SOD, and catalase, we showed that ROS were partially involved in the senescence response. Furthermore, GT-induced cell cycle arrest in S-phase in all HCT116 cell lines. At later time points, we noticed that p53 and p21 null cells escaped complete arrest and re-entered cell cycle provoking higher rates of multinucleation. The senescence induction by GT was irreversible and was accompanied by significant DNA damage as evidenced by p-H2AX staining. Our findings indicate that GT is an interesting anti colon cancer agent which warrants further study. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
25789847	Phytochemical regulation of the tumor suppressive microRNA, miR-34a, by p53-dependent and independent responses in human breast cancer cells.	Hargraves KG, He L, Firestone GL.	The tumor suppressive microRNA miR-34a is transcriptionally regulated by p53 and shown to inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation as well as being a marker of increased disease free survival. Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) derived from cruciferous vegetables, artemisinin, extracted from the sweet wormwood plant, and artesunate, a semi-synthetic derivative of artemisinin, are phytochemicals with anti-tumorigenic properties however, little is known about the role of microRNAs in their mechanism of action. Human breast cancer cells expressing wild-type (MCF-7) or mutant p53 (T47D) were treated with a concentration range and time course of each phytochemical under conditions of cell cycle arrest as detected by flow cytometry to examine the potential connection between miR-34a expression and their anti-proliferative responses. Real-time PCR and western blot analysis of extracted RNA and total protein revealed artemsinin and artesunate increased miR-34a expression in a dose-dependent manner correlating with down-regulation of the miR-34a target gene, CDK4. I3C stimulation of miR-34a expression required functional p53, whereas, both artemisinin and artesunate up-regulated miR-34a expression regardless of p53 mutational status or in the presence of dominant negative p53. Phytochemical treatments inhibited the luciferase activity of a construct containing the wild-type 3'UTR of CDK4, but not those with a mutated miR-34a binding site, whereas, transfection of miR-34a inhibitors ablated the phytochemical mediated down-regulation of CDK4 and induction of cell cycle arrest. Our results suggest that miR-34a is an essential component of the anti-proliferative activities of I3C, artemisinin, and artesunate and demonstrate that both wild-type p53 dependent and independent pathways are responsible for miR-34a induction. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
25809501	Phlda3, a urine-detectable protein, causes p53 accumulation in renal tubular cells injured by cisplatin.	Lee CG, Kang YJ, Kim HS, Moon A, Kim SG.	Measurable indicators of renal injury are required for the assessment of kidney function after toxicant challenge. In our previous study, pleckstrin homology-like domain, family A, member 3 (Phlda3) was a most greatly up-regulated molecule downstream from p53, culminating with kidney tubular injury. This study investigated the positive feedforward effect of Phlda3 on p53 in an effort to explain the largest increase of Phlda3 in injured tubules and the potential of its urine excretion. qRT-PCR assays confirmed a rapid and substantial increase in Phlda3 messenger RNA (mRNA) in the kidney cortex of mice treated with a single dose of cisplatin. Cisplatin overexpression of Phlda3 was verified by gene set analyses of three different microarray databases. In the immunohistochemistry, Phlda3 staining intensities were augmented in the tubules as kidney injury worsened. Moreover, the urinary content of Phlda3 was increased after cisplatin treatment, as were those of other kidney injury markers (Kim-1 and Timp-1). By contrast, cisplatin failed to increase Phlda3 mRNA in the liver despite hepatocyte necrosis and ensuing increases in serum transaminase activities. In NRK52E tubular cells, siRNA knockdown of Phlda3 enhanced the ability of cisplatin to increase p-Mdm2 presumably via Akt, enforcing the interaction between Mdm2 and p53. Consistently, a deficiency in Phlda3 abrogated p53 increase by cisplatin, indicating that Phlda3 promotes p53 accumulation. Phlda3 overexpression had the opposite effect. In addition, treatment with cyclosporine A or CdCl2, other nephrotoxicants, increased Phlda3 mRNA and protein levels in NRK52E cells, as did cisplatin treatment. Overall, Phlda3 may cause p53 accumulation through a feedforward pathway, facilitating tubular injury and its urine excretion.
25844948	Connecting radiation-induced bystander effects and senescence to improve radiation response prediction.	Poleszczuk J, Krzywon A, Forys U, Widel M.	For the last two decades radiation-induced bystander effects (RIBEs) have attracted significant attention due to their possible implications for radiotherapy. However, despite extensive research, the molecular pathways associated with RIBEs are still not completely known. In the current study we investigated the role of senescence in the bystander response. Irradiated (2, 4, 6 and 8 Gy) human colorectal carcinoma cells (HCT116) with p53(+/+) (wild-type) or p53(-/-) (knockout) gene were co-incubated with nonirradiated cells of the same type. Clonogenic and senescence assays were used for both irradiated and co-incubated bystander cell populations. We also performed additional measurements on the number of remaining cells after the whole co-incubation period. For radiation doses larger than 2 Gy we observed much larger fractions of senescent cells in p53-positive populations compared to their p53-negative counterparts (15.81% vs. 3.63% in the irradiated population; 2.89% vs. 1.05% in the bystander population; 8 Gy; P < 0.05). Statistically significant differences between cell lines in the clonogenic cell surviving fraction were observed for doses higher than 4 Gy (1.61% for p53(+/+) vs. 0.19% for p53(-/-) in irradiated population; 3.57% for +/+ vs. 50.39% for -/- in bystander population; 8 Gy; P < 0.05). Our main finding was that the number of senescent cells in the irradiated population correlated strongly with the clonogenic cell surviving fraction (R = -0.98, P < 0.001) and the number of senescent cells (R = 0.97, P < 0.001) in the bystander population. We also extended the standard linear-quadratic radiation response model by incorporating the influence of the signals released by the senescent cells, which accurately described the radiation response in the bystander population. Our findings suggest that radiation-induced senescence might be a key player in RIBE, i.e., the strength of RIBE depends on the amount of radiation-induced senescence.
25865700	Up-Regulation of miR-34a Expression in Response to the Luteolin-Induced Neurite Outgrowth of PC12 Cells.	Chen PY, Wu MJ, Chang HY, Tai MH, Ho CT, Yen JH.	Luteolin (3',4',5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone), a flavonoid found in several vegetables and fruits, has been reported to possess neurotrophic activities that are associated with its capacity to promote neuronal survival and differentiation. In the present study, we report for the first time a genomewide screen for microRNAs (miRNAs) regulated during the luteolin-mediated neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. We found that after luteolin treatment, the abundance of 16 miRNAs was markedly up-regulated and that of 3 miRNAs was down-regulated in PC12 cells. The induction of miR-34a by luteolin was the most pronounced among these differentially expressed miRNAs. The correlation between miR-34a down-regulation and decreased luteolin-mediated neurite outgrowth may indicate a mechanism by which miR-34a may act as a modulator of neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, we found that luteolin enhanced the phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15, which was associated with the promotion of miR-34a transcription and neurite outgrowth. Moreover, the level of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a known miR-34a target, was reduced during luteolin-induced neurite outgrowth. In turn, the level of acetylated p53, a substrate of SIRT1, was correspondingly increased in luteolin-treated PC12 cells. In addition to p53 activation, we further identified that luteolin-induced miR-34a transcription and neurite outgrowth involved the activation of the JNK and p38 MAPK pathways. However, the inhibition of JNK and p38 MAPK activation did not block luteolin-induced p53 activation in PC12 cells. Our findings suggested that the activation of both p53-dependent and p53-independent miR-34a/SIRT1 pathways plays a critical role in the mechanisms underlying luteolin-induced neuritogenesis.
25963977	Genomic regulation of senescence and innate immunity signaling in the retinal pigment epithelium.	Chaum E, Winborn CS, Bhattacharya S.	The tumor suppressor p53 is a major regulator of genes important for cell cycle arrest, senescence, apoptosis, and innate immunity, and has recently been implicated in retinal aging. In this study we sought to identify the genetic networks that regulate p53 function in the retina using quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. First we examined age-associated changes in the activation and expression levels of p53; known p53 target proteins and markers of innate immune system activation in primary retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells that were harvested from young and aged human donors. We observed increased expression of p53, activated caspase-1, CDKN1A, CDKN2A (p16INK4a), TLR4, and IFNα in aged primary RPE cell lines. We used the Hamilton Eye Institute (HEI) retinal dataset ( www.genenetwork.org ) to identify genomic loci that modulate expression of genes in the p53 pathway in recombinant inbred BXD mouse strains using a QTL systems biology-based approach. We identified a significant trans-QTL on chromosome 1 (region 172-177 Mb) that regulates the expression of Cdkn1a. Many of the genes in this QTL locus are involved in innate immune responses, including Fc receptors, interferon-inducible family genes, and formin 2. Importantly, we found an age-related increase in FCGR3A and FMN2 and a decrease in IFI16 levels in RPE cultures. There is a complex multigenic innate immunity locus that controls expression of genes in the p53 pathway in the RPE, which may play an important role in modulating age-related changes in the retina.
25996295	The nucleoprotein of influenza A virus induces p53 signaling and apoptosis via attenuation of host ubiquitin ligase RNF43.	Nailwal H, Sharma S, Mayank AK, Lal SK.	The interplay between influenza virus and host factors to support the viral life cycle is well documented. Influenza A virus (IAV) proteins interact with an array of cellular proteins and hijack host pathways which are at the helm of cellular responses to facilitate virus invasion. The multifaceted nature of the ubiquitination pathway for protein regulation makes it a vulnerable target of many viruses including IAV. To this end we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen to search for cellular ubiquitin ligases important for influenza virus replication. We identified host protein, RING finger protein 43 (RNF43), a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, as a novel interactor of nucleoprotein (NP) of IAV and an essential partner to induce NP-driven p53-mediated apoptosis in IAV-infected cells. In this study, we demonstrate that IAV leads to attenuation of RNF43 transcripts and hence its respective protein levels in the cellular milieu whereas in RNF43 depleted cells, viral replication was escalated several folds. Moreover, RNF43 polyubiquitinates p53 which further leads to its destabilization resulting in a decrease in induction of the p53 apoptotic pathway, a hitherto unknown process targeted by NP for p53 stabilization and accumulation. Collectively, these results conclude that NP targets RNF43 to modulate p53 ubiquitination levels and hence causes p53 stabilization which is conducive to an enhanced apoptosis level in the host cells. In conclusion, our study unravels a novel strategy adopted by IAV for utilizing the much conserved ubiquitin proteasomal pathway.
26043079	Microglia-derived IL-1β triggers p53-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in neural precursor cells.	Guadagno J, Swan P, Shaikh R, Cregan SP.	Neurogenesis persists in the adult brain and can contribute to learning and memory processes and potentially to regeneration and repair of the affected nervous system. Deregulated neurogenesis has been observed in neuropathological conditions including neurodegenerative diseases, trauma and stroke. However, the survival of neural precursor cells (NPCs) and newly born neurons is adversely affected by the inflammatory environment that arises as a result of microglial activation associated with injury or disease processes. In the present study, we have investigated the mechanisms by which microglia affect NPC proliferation and survival. Importantly, we demonstrate that interleukin-1β (IL-1β) produced by lipopolysaccharide/interferon-γ-activated microglia is necessary to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in NPCs in vitro. Mechanistically, we show that IL-1β activates the tumor suppressor p53 through an oxidative stress-dependent mechanism resulting in p53-mediated induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and the proapoptotic Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma-2) family members Puma (p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis) and Noxa. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induced by recombinant IL-1β or activated microglia is attenuated in p53-deficient NPCs. Finally, we have determined that IL-1β induces NPC death via the p53-dependent induction of Puma leading to the activation of a Bax (Bcl-2-associated X protein)-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. In summary, we have elucidated a novel role for p53 in the regulation of NPC proliferation and survival during neuroinflammatory conditions that could be targeted to promote neurogenesis and repair in a number of neurological conditions.
26068791	Δ122p53, a mouse model of Δ133p53α, enhances the tumor-suppressor activities of an attenuated p53 mutant.	Slatter TL, Hung N, Bowie S, Campbell H, Rubio C, Speidel D, Wilson M, Baird M, Royds JA, Braithwaite AW.	Growing evidence suggests the Δ133p53α isoform may function as an oncogene. It is overexpressed in many tumors, stimulates pathways involved in tumor progression, and inhibits some activities of wild-type p53, including transactivation and apoptosis. We hypothesized that Δ133p53α would have an even more profound effect on p53 variants with weaker tumor-suppressor capability. We tested this using a mouse model heterozygous for a Δ133p53α-like isoform (Δ122p53) and a p53 mutant with weak tumor-suppressor function (mΔpro). The Δ122p53/mΔpro mice showed a unique survival curve with a wide range of survival times (92-495 days) which was much greater than mΔpro/- mice (range 120-250 days) and mice heterozygous for the Δ122p53 and p53 null alleles (Δ122p53/-, range 78-150 days), suggesting Δ122p53 increased the tumor-suppressor activity of mΔpro. Moreover, some of the mice that survived longest only developed benign tumors. In vitro analyses to investigate why some Δ122p53/mΔpro mice were protected from aggressive tumors revealed that Δ122p53 stabilized mΔpro and prolonged the response to DNA damage. Similar effects of Δ122p53 and Δ133p53α were observed on wild-type of full-length p53, but these did not result in improved biological responses. The data suggest that Δ122p53 (and Δ133p53α) could offer some protection against tumors by enhancing the p53 response to stress.
25432984	Role of WW domain proteins WWOX in development, prognosis, and treatment response of glioma.	Liu SY, Chiang MF, Chen YJ.	Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive and malignant brain tumor. Delicate microenvironment and lineage heterogeneity of GBM cells including infiltration, hypoxia, angiogenesis, and stemness make them highly resistant to current conventional therapies, with an average life expectancy for GBM patients of less than 15 months. Poor response to cytotoxic agents of GBM cells remains the major challenge of GBM treatment. Resistance of GBM to clinical treatment is a result of genomic alternation and deregulated signaling pathways, such as p53 mutation and apoptosis signaling blockage, providing cancer cells more opportunities for survival rather than cell death. WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) is a tumor suppressor gene, commonly downregulated in various types of tumors, including GBM. It has been found that the reintroduction of WWOX induced p53-mutant GBM cells to undergo apoptosis, but not in p53 wild-type GBM cells, indicating WWOX is likely to reopen apoptosis pathways in a p53-independent manner in GBM. Identifying the crucial target modulated by WWOX deficiency provides a potential therapeutic target for GBM treatment. Here, we have reviewed the literatures about the role of WWOX in development, signaling pathway, prognosis, and treatment response in malignant glioma.
25517961	Locus/chromosome aberrations in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization.	Miyabe K, Hori Y, Nakazawa T, Hayashi K, Naitoh I, Shimizu S, Kondo H, Nishi Y, Yoshida M, Umemura S, Kato A, Ohara H, Joh T, Inagaki H.	Locus and chromosome abnormalities have not been well clarified in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). The aim of this study was to retrospectively examine these abnormalities using fluorescence in situ hybridization. IPMNs (n=28) were histopathologically classified into noninvasive IPMN (n=17) and IPMN with an associated invasive carcinoma (invasive IPMN, n=11) groups. Noninvasive IPMNs possessed non-neoplastic and noninvasive spots in their tissues, and invasive IPMN cases possessed non-neoplastic, noninvasive, and invasive spots. Non-neoplastic (n=28), noninvasive (n=28), and invasive (n=11) spots were then analyzed for aneuploidy of chromosomes 3, 6, 7, 8, 17, and 18 and deletions of p16 and p53 loci. Polysomy 6 and p16 deletion were significantly more frequent in noninvasive than in non-neoplastic spots. Polysomy 7, polysomy 18, p16 deletion, and p53 deletion were significantly more frequent in invasive than in noninvasive spots. Detection of polysomy 7 and p53 deletion gave a high diagnostic accuracy for invasive IPMN (sensitivity, 90.9%; specificity, 94.1%; and accuracy, 92.5%). Our study suggests that: (1) polysomy 6 and p16 deletion may contribute to adenomatous change of IPMN; (2) polysomy 7, polysomy 18, p16 deletion, and p53 deletion play roles in malignant transformation of noninvasive IPMN; and (3) polysomy 7 and p53 deletion may be excellent diagnostic markers for invasive IPMN.
25511237	Overexpression of ankyrin repeat domain 1 enhances cardiomyocyte apoptosis by promoting p53 activation and mitochondrial dysfunction in rodents.	Shen L, Chen C, Wei X, Li X, Luo G, Zhang J, Bin J, Huang X, Cao S, Li G, Liao Y.	The Ankrd1 (ankyrin repeat domain 1) gene is known to be up-regulated in heart failure and acts as a co-activator of p53, modulating its transcriptional activity, but it remains inconclusive whether this gene promotes or inhibits cell apoptosis. In the present study, we attempted to investigate the role of Ankrd1 on AngII (angiotensin II)- or pressure-overload-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. In the failing hearts of mice with pressure overload, the protein expression of Ankrd1-encoded CARP (cardiac ankyrin repeat protein) was significantly increased. In NRCs (neonatal rat cardiomyocytes), AngII increased the expression of Ankrd1 and CARP. In the presence of AngII in NRCs, infection with a recombinant adenovirus containing rat Ankrd1 cDNA (Ad-Ankrd1) enhanced the mitochondrial translocation of Bax and phosphorylated p53, increased mitochondrial permeability and cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and reduced cell viability, whereas these effects were antagonized by silencing of Ankrd1. Intra-myocardial injection of Ad-Ankrd1 in mice with TAC (transverse aortic constriction) markedly exacerbated cardiac dysfunction with an increase in the lung weight/body weight ratio and a decrease in left ventricular fractional shortening. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis and the expression of phosphorylated p53 were also significantly increased in Ad-Ankrd1-infected TAC mice, whereas knockdown of Ankrd1 significantly inhibited the apoptotic signal pathway as well as cardiomyocyte apoptosis in pressure-overload mice. These findings indicate that overexpression of Ankrd1 exacerbates pathological cardiac dysfunction through enhancement of cardiomyocyte apoptosis mediated by the up-regulation of p53.
25500526	New molecular beacon for p53 gene point mutation and significant potential in serving as the polymerization primer.	Xu J, Dong H, Shen W, He S, Li H, Lu Y, Wu ZS, Jia L.	Molecular beacon (MB) is usually explored as a convenient probe for various bioassays. In an enzymatic polymerization-based biosensing system, primer, and MB, sometimes involving other oligonucleotides, are often required to collaboratively generate an amplified fluorescent signal to detect target molecules with high sensitivity and specificity. In the current study, a multifunctional primer-integrated MB (MP-MB) was developed to detect the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Compared with the traditional MB, our MP-MB can not only selectively identify the target of interest and signal sensitively its hybridization event, but also act as the primer during enzymatic polymerization. Specifically, hybridization of MP-MB to target p53 gene restored the fluorescence intensity and activated the pre-locked primer designed by changing the molecular configuration of MP-MB. Moreover, the p53 gene could be detected down to 1nM with a linear response range of 1×10(-9)-3×10(-7)M, and p53 gene point mutation was readily distinguished from the wild-type one. Its potential application as a primer of replication in enzymatic polymerization-based assay systems was validated by running parallel gel electrophoreses in comparison with the native counterpart of MP-MB without any chemical modification. Owning to its excellent assay characteristics, less species requirement, broad sequence diversity and preserved intrinsic bioactivity, the proof-of-concept of MP-MB exhibits a great potential in various biomedical applications.
25638533	Activation of miR-34a/SIRT1/p53 signaling contributes to cochlear hair cell apoptosis: implications for age-related hearing loss.	Xiong H, Pang J, Yang H, Dai M, Liu Y, Ou Y, Huang Q, Chen S, Zhang Z, Xu Y, Lai L, Zheng Y.	The molecular mechanisms underlying age-related hearing loss are not fully understood, and currently, there is no treatment for this disorder. MicroRNAs have recently been reported to be increasingly associated with age-related diseases and are emerging as promising therapeutic targets. In this study, miR-34a/Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)/p53 signaling was examined in cochlear hair cells during aging. MiR-34a, p53 acetylation, and apoptosis increased in the cochlea of C57BL/6 mice with aging, whereas an age-related decrease in SIRT1 was observed. In the inner ear HEI-OC1 cell line, miR-34a overexpression inhibited SIRT1, leading to an increase in p53 acetylation and apoptosis. Moreover, miR-34a knockdown increased SIRT1 expression and diminished p53 acetylation, and apoptosis. Additionally, resveratrol, an activator of SIRT1, significantly rescued miR-34a overexpression-induced HEI-OC1 cell death and significantly reduced hearing threshold shifts and hair cell loss in C57BL/6 mice after a 2-month administration. Our results support a link between age-related cochlear hair cell apoptosis and miR-34a/SIRT1/p53 signaling, which may serve as a potential target for age-related hearing loss treatment.
25736278	Association Between Smoking and p53 Mutation in Oesophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Meta-analysis.	Wu XC, Zheng YF, Tang M, Li XF, Zeng R, Zhang JR.	AIMS: Several studies have evaluated the association between smoking and p53 mutation in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), but the conclusions are inconsistent. The aim of the present study was to carry out a meta-analysis evaluating the relationship between smoking and p53 mutation in patients with ESCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible studies were identified through searches in PubMed and EMBASE. The odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was used to assess the association. In total, 20 studies were identified that met the selection criteria; these studies were analysed using STATA 12.0 software. RESULTS: The 20 studies identified comprised 1524 ESCC patients, of whom 72.97% were smokers and 27.03% were non-smokers. The pooled odds ratio of p53 mutation in ESCC for any cigarette smoking versus no smoking was 1.28 (95% confidence interval=0.88-1.88). The estimated odds ratios were 1.06 (95% confidence interval=0.56-2.00, based on five studies, 129 light smokers and 70 non-smokers) for light smoking and 2.01 (95% confidence interval=1.12-3.60, based on five studies, 223 heavy smokers and 73 non-smokers) for heavy smoking. CONCLUSION: The results of our meta-analysis indicate an overall positive relationship between heavy smoking and p53 mutation in ESCC. Heavy smokers with ESCC have a higher risk for p53 mutation than non-smokers. Large-scale clinical studies are still needed to draw a more precise conclusion.
25750305	Expression of immunohistochemical markers of progression in pre-cancerous and cancerous human colon: correlation with serum vitamin D levels.	Juniku-Shkololli A, Manxhuka-Kerliu S, Ahmetaj H, Khare V, Zekaj S.	BACKGROUND/AIM: We aimed to evaluate vitamin D levels in blood, as well as the immunohistological expression of β-catenin, p21 activated kinase (PAK1), p53 and Ki67 in relation to histological type and grading of colonic tumors. RESULTS were compared to the expression in normal and adenomatous colon. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed colorectal specimens from 20 patients with colorectal tumors for expression of β-catenin, PAK1, p53 and Ki67. Associations between the expression of these markers and levels of vitamin D in serum were analyzed. RESULTS: The average 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25OHD) level in a healthy population was 20.53 ng/ml, while that in patients with colorectal cancer was 5.99 ng/ml. The average vitamin D level in patients with positive nuclear β-catenin was 4.58 ng/ml, which was lower than that of patients with negative nuclear β-catenin expression. Patients with positive nuclear PAK1 also had low vitamin D levels in their blood (4.51 ng/ml). Patients with positive nuclear p53 had significantly lower vitamin D levels (4.18 ng/ml), compared to patients without nuclear p53 expression. In patients with Ki67 expression in at least 50% of cells, the average vitamin D level was 6.27 ng/ml, while in patients with Ki67 staining in fewer than 50% of cells, the average vitamin D levels in serum was double (13.42 ng/ml).
26349782	An indolylquinoline derivative promotes apoptosis in human lung cancer cells by impairing mitochondrial functions.	Liu CY, Wu PT, Wang JP, Fan PW, Hsieh CH, Su CL, Chiu CC, Yao CF, Fang K.	A number of effective anti-cancer drugs contain either indole or quinoline group. Compounds fused indole and quinoline moieties altogether as indolylquinoline were rarely reported as anti-cancer agents. We reported here that a synthetic indolylquinoline derivative, 3-((7-ethyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-methyl)-2-methylquinoline (EMMQ), inhibited the growth of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells in dose- and time-dependent manners. The cytotoxicity was mediated through apoptotic cell death that began with mitochondrial membrane potential interruption and DNA damage. EMMQ caused transient elevation of p53 that assists in cytochrome c release, cleavage of downstream PARP and procaspase-3 and mitochondria-related apoptosis. The degree of apoptotic cell death depends on the status of tumor suppressor p53 of the target cells. H1299 cells with stable ectopic expression of p53 induced cytotoxicity by disrupting mitochondria functions that differed with those transfected with mutant p53. Knocking-down of p53 attenuated drug effects. EMMQ suppressed the growth of A549 tumor cells in xenograft tumors by exhibiting apoptosis characteristics. Given its small molecular weight acting as an effective p53 regulator in NSCLC cells, EMMQ could be an addition to the current list of lung cancer treatment.
26169984	Novel protein-protein interactions of TPPII, p53, and SIRT7.	Nahálková J.	Novel protein-protein interactions of TPPII, SIRT7, and p53 were detected by co-immunoprecipitation using both HeLa cell lysates and the cytoplasmic fraction prepared by fractionation of mouse liver tissue. The interactions were further verified in vivo by in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) within control HEK293 cells transformed with empty vector, highactTPPII HEK293 cells over-expressing murine TPPII displaying high specific enzymatic activity and in lowactTPPII HEK293 cells over-expressing human TPPII having low specific activity of the enzyme. Besides an abundant cytoplasmic localization of TPPII-p53 interaction signal, the nuclear interactions were also demonstrated. The cytoplasmic interactions were likewise detected between TPPII and SIRT7 in control HEK293 and lowactTPPII HEK293 cells. The interactions of SIRT7 with p53 were confirmed in three HEK293 cell transformants as well. The cytoplasmic occurrence of SIRT7 protein was demonstrated by immunofluorescence, when both nucleolar and cytoplasmic signals were identified within HEK293 cells and primary human fibroblasts. The unique cytoplasmic localization of SIRT7 protein was discussed based on an epitope specificity of N-terminus specific SIRT7 antibodies utilized in the present study compared with C-terminus specific antibodies previously used for nuclear detection of SIRT7 by other authors. The epitope sequence of N-terminal antibodies is occurring in all three splicing variants of SIRT7 compared to the epitope of C-terminal antibody, which is specific exclusively to the splicing variant 1. The cytoplasmic localization of p53 detected by immunofluorescence supported the results from its interactions with TPPII and SIRT7 observed by in situ PLA within model cells. Novel interactions of TPPII, p53, and SIRT7 presented in this study might contribute to the knowledge of the regulatory effects of these proteins on apoptotic pathways and to the understanding mechanisms of aging and lifespan regulation.
26053091	NDRG4 is a novel oncogenic protein and p53 associated regulator of apoptosis in malignant meningioma cells.	Kotipatruni RP, Ren X, Thotala D, Jaboin JJ.	Aggressive meningiomas exhibit high levels of recurrence, morbidity and mortality. When surgical and radiation options are exhausted, there is need for novel molecularly-targeted therapies. We have recently identified NDRG4 overexpression in aggressive meningiomas. NDRG4 is a member of the N-Myc Downstream Regulated Gene (NDRG) family of the alpha/beta hydrolase superfamily. We have demonstrated that NDRG4 downregulation results in decreased cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In follow up to our prior studies; here we demonstrate that the predominant form of cell death following NDRG4 silencing is apoptosis, utilizing Annexin-V flow cytometry assay. We show that apoptosis caused by p53 upregulation, phosphorylation at Ser15, BAX activation, Bcl-2 and BcL-xL downregulation, mitochondrial cytochrome c release and execution of caspases following NDRG4 depletion. Sub-cellular distribution of BAX and cytochrome c indicated mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. In addition, we carried out the fluorescence cytochemical analysis to confirm mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis by changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (Ψm), using JC-1 dye. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence confirmed binding of NDRG4 to p53. In addition, we demonstrate that apoptosis is mitochondrial and p53 dependent. The proapoptotic effect of p53 was verified by the results in which a small molecule compound PFT-α, an inhibitor of p53 phosphorylation, is greatly protected against targeting NDRG4 induced apoptosis. These findings bring novel insight to the roles of NDRG4 in meningioma progression. A better understanding of this pathway and its role in meningioma carcinogenesis and cell biology is promising for the development of novel therapeutic targets for the management of aggressive meningiomas.
26318295	Regulation of p53 expression and apoptosis by vault RNA2-1-5p in cervical cancer cells.	Kong L, Hao Q, Wang Y, Zhou P, Zou B, Zhang YX.	nc886 or VRNA2-1 has recently been identified as a noncoding RNA instead of a vault RNA or a pre-microRNA. Several studies have reported that pre-miR-886 plays a tumor-suppressive role in a wide range of cancer cells through its activity as a cellular protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR) ligand and repressor. However, by sequencing stem-PCR products, we found that a microRNA originating from this precursor, vault RNA2-1-5p (VTRNA2-1-5p), occurs in cervical cancer cells. The expression levels of the predicted targets of VTRNA2-1-5p are negatively correlated with VTRNA2-1-5p levels by quantitative reversion transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Previous results have shown that VTRNA2-1-5p is overexpressed in human cervical squamous cell carcinomas (CSCCs) compared with adjacent healthy tissues. Inhibition of VTRNA2-1-5p increases Bax protein expression and apoptotic cell death in cervical cancer cells. Our findings suggest that VTRNA2-1-5p has oncogenic activity related to the progression of cervical cancer. Here, we report that VTRNA2-1-5p directly targeted p53 expression and functioned as an oncomir in cervical cancer. VTRNA2-1-5p inhibition decreased cervical cancer cell invasion, proliferation, and tumorigenicity while increasing apoptosis and p53 expression. Interestingly, VTRNA2-1-5p inhibition also increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis of HeLa and SiHa cells. In human clinical cervical cancer specimens, low p53 expression and high VTRNA2-1-5p expression were positively associated.In addition, VTRNA2-1-5p was found to directly target the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of p53. We propose that VTRNA2-1-5p is a direct regulator of p53 and suggest that it plays an essential role in the apoptosis and proliferation of cervical cancer cells.
25941131	DNA damage in children with scoliosis following X-ray exposure.	Himmetoglu S, Guven MF, Bilsel N, Dincer Y.	AIM: It has been suggested that cancer incidence is high in subjects with scoliosis who are relatively more often exposed to X-ray for diagnosis and follow-up. X-ray is a kind of ionizing radiation and leads to formation of oxygen free radicals which are capable of damage to DNA, thus altered gen expression and mutation. p53 tumor suppressor gene plays a crucial role in the damage response. It controls the checkpoint of cell cycle and redirects the cell metabolism to either repair of damaged DNA or apoptosis as response to DNA damage. The aim of the present study was to examine serum levels of 8-Hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a strongly mutagenic product of oxidative DNA damage, p53, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (G-Px), as antioxidant activity, in children with scoliosis who had got whole spine radiograph two times during the last year. METHODS: A total of 31 children with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and 21 age-matched healthy children were included in the study. Serum levels of 8-OHdG and p53 were measured with ELISA kits. SOD and G-Px activities were determined with spectrophotometric assays. RESULTS: Serum levels of 8-OHdG and p53 were found to be higher (P<0.001 and P<0.01, respectively), SOD activity was found to be lower (P<0.001) in the children with scoliosis as compared to age-matched controls. There was no significant difference between the groups for G-Px activity. CONCLUSION: Our data show that X-ray exposure causes increased 8-OHdG level, and decreased SOD activity, which both may reflect a tumor promoting condition. Increased p53 level may be interpreted as a compensatory effort of cell to X-ray mediated DNA damage.
24964769	P14ARF deficiency and its correlation with overexpression of p53/MDM2 in sporadic vestibular schwannomas.	Chen Y, Wang ZY, Wu H.	Recent studies have shed considerable light into schwannomas. To date, only merlin has been identified as a hallmark or pathogenesis of both sporadic and NF2-related schwannomas. Here, we show, by immunoblot and immunohistochemical analyses of 58 sporadic vestibular schwannomas, that upregulation of p53 was observed in 90 % of tumors examined. No p53 mutations were found in 12 % tumors analyzed. Expression of p14ARF was negative in 95 % of tumors, while overexpression of MDM2 was found in all specimens. Aberrant DNA hypermethylation of the p14ARF promoter was observed in three of seven tumors examined (43 %), associated with remarkably decreased mRNA levels. The very high degree of concordance in the aberrations of the p14ARF/MDM2/p53 pathway in this tumor may be considered to be a new player in the pathogenesis of sporadic vestibular schwannomas. Moreover, expression of p21 (waf1) was negative in all tumors, suggesting that the aberration of this pathway is associated with greater attenuation of p21-mediated signals that are critical for growth inhibition. These data are in agreement with the model in RT-4 rat schwannoma cells: i.e., overexpression of ARF was associated with accumulation of p21 expression both at protein and mRNA levels. ShRNA knock-down of p53 expression attenuated p21-mediated increase in cellular arrest in the G1-phase, suggesting that p14ARF regulates p21 protein levels through a p53-dependent pathway. Thus, this study reveals a high degree of concordance in the aberrations of the p14ARF/MDM2/p53 pathway with the development of sporadic vestibular schwannomas.
25578565	RBM5 and p53 expression after rat spinal cord injury: implications for neuronal apoptosis.	Zhang J, Cui Z, Feng G, Bao G, Xu G, Sun Y, Wang L, Chen J, Jin H, Liu J, Yang L, Li W.	RBM5 (RNA-binding motif protein 5), a nuclear RNA binding protein, is known to trigger apoptosis and induce cell cycle arrest by regulating the activity of the tumor suppressor protein p53. However, its expression and function in spinal cord injury (SCI) are still unknown. To investigate whether RBM5 is involved in central nervous system injury and repair, we performed an acute SCI model in adult rats in this study. Our results showed RBM5 was unregulated significantly after SCI, which was accompanied with an increase in the levels of apoptotic proteins such as p53, Bax, and active caspase-3. Immunofluorescent labeling also showed that traumatic SCI induced RBM5 location changes and co-localization with active caspase-3 in neurons. To further probe the role of RBM5, a neuronal cell line PC12 was employed to establish an apoptotic model. Knockdown of RBM5 apparently decreased the level of p53 as well as active caspase-3, demonstrating its pro-apoptotic role in neurons by regulating expressions of p53 and caspase-3. Taken together, our findings indicate that RBM5 promotes neuronal apoptosis through modulating p53 signaling pathway following SCI.
26236013	Pin1-Induced Proline Isomerization in Cytosolic p53 Mediates BAX Activation and Apoptosis.	Follis AV, Llambi F, Merritt P, Chipuk JE, Green DR, Kriwacki RW.	The cytosolic fraction of the tumor suppressor p53 activates the apoptotic effector protein BAX to trigger apoptosis. Here we report that p53 activates BAX through a mechanism different from that associated with activation by BH3 only proteins (BIM and BID). We observed that cis-trans isomerization of proline 47 (Pro47) within p53, an inherently rare molecular event, was required for BAX activation. The prolyl isomerase Pin1 enhanced p53-dependent BAX activation by catalyzing cis-trans interconversion of p53 Pro47. Our results reveal a signaling mechanism whereby proline cis-trans isomerization in one protein triggers conformational and functional changes in a downstream signaling partner. Activation of BAX through the concerted action of cytosolic p53 and Pin1 may integrate cell stress signals to induce a direct apoptotic response.
26054846	Loss of protein phosphatase 6 in mouse keratinocytes increases susceptibility to ultraviolet-B-induced carcinogenesis.	Kato H, Kurosawa K, Inoue Y, Tanuma N, Momoi Y, Hayashi K, Ogoh H, Nomura M, Sakayori M, Kakugawa Y, Yamashita Y, Miura K, Maemondo M, Katakura R, Ito S, Sato M, Sato I, Chiba N, Watanabe T, Shima H.	We previously reported that deficiency in the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 6 (Ppp6c) predisposes mouse skin tissue to papilloma formation initiated by DMBA. Here, we demonstrate that Ppp6c loss acts as a tumor promoter in UVB-induced squamous cell carcinogenesis. Following UVB irradiation, mice with Ppp6c-deficient keratinocytes showed a higher incidence of skin squamous cell carcinoma than did control mice. Time course experiments showed that following UVB irradiation, Ppp6c-deficient keratinocytes upregulated expression of p53, PUMA, BAX, and cleaved caspase-3 proteins. UVB-induced tumors in Ppp6c-deficient keratinocytes exhibited a high frequency of both p53- and γH2AX-positive cells, suggestive of DNA damage. Epidemiological and molecular data strongly suggest that UVB from sunlight induces p53 gene mutations in keratinocytes and is the primary causative agent of human skin cancers. Our analysis suggests that PP6 deficiency underlies molecular events that drive outgrowth of initiated keratinocytes harboring UVB-induced mutated p53. Understanding PP6 function in preventing UV-induced tumorigenesis could suggest strategies to prevent and treat this condition.
25944899	The Tyrosine Kinase c-Abl Promotes Homeodomain-interacting Protein Kinase 2 (HIPK2) Accumulation and Activation in Response to DNA Damage.	Reuven N, Adler J, Porat Z, Polonio-Vallon T, Hofmann TG, Shaul Y.	The non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl is activated in response to DNA damage and induces p73-dependent apoptosis. Here, we investigated c-Abl regulation of the homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2), an important regulator of p53-dependent apoptosis. c-Abl phosphorylated HIPK2 at several sites, and phosphorylation by c-Abl protected HIPK2 from degradation mediated by the ubiquitin E3 ligase Siah-1. c-Abl and HIPK2 synergized in activating p53 on apoptotic promoters in a reporter assay, and c-Abl was required for endogenous HIPK2 accumulation and phosphorylation of p53 at Ser(46) in response to DNA damage by γ- and UV radiation. Accumulation of HIPK2 in nuclear speckles and association with promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) in response to DNA damage were also dependent on c-Abl activity. At high cell density, the Hippo pathway inhibits DNA damage-induced c-Abl activation. Under this condition, DNA damage-induced HIPK2 accumulation, phosphorylation of p53 at Ser(46), and apoptosis were attenuated. These data demonstrate a new mechanism for the induction of DNA damage-induced apoptosis by c-Abl and illustrate network interactions between serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases that dictate cell fate.
25349197	Murine Double Minute-2 Prevents p53-Overactivation-Related Cell Death (Podoptosis) of Podocytes.	Thomasova D, Bruns HA, Kretschmer V, Ebrahim M, Romoli S, Liapis H, Kotb AM, Endlich N, Anders HJ.	Murine double minute-2 (MDM2), an E3 ligase that regulates the cell cycle and inflammation, is highly expressed in podocytes. In podocyte injury, MDM2 drives podocyte loss by mitotic catastrophe, but the function of MDM2 in resting podocytes has not been explored. Here, we investigated the effects of podocyte MDM2 deletion in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, MDM2 knockdown by siRNA caused increased expression of p53 and podocyte death, which was completely rescued by coknockdown of p53. Apoptosis, pyroptosis, pyronecrosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, and parthanatos were excluded as modes of occurrence for this p53-overactivation-related cell death (here referred to as podoptosis). Podoptosis was associated with cytoplasmic vacuolization, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and dysregulated autophagy (previously described as paraptosis). MDM2 knockdown caused podocyte loss and proteinuria in a zebrafish model, which was consistent with the phenotype of podocyte-specific MDM2-knockout mice that also showed the aforementioned ultrastructual podocyte abnormalities before and during progressive glomerulosclerosis. The phenotype of both animal models was entirely rescued by codeletion of p53. We conclude that MDM2 maintains homeostasis and long-term survival in podocytes by preventing podoptosis, a p53-regulated form of cell death with unspecific features previously classified as paraptosis.
25565400	Decarbamoyl mitomycin C (DMC) activates p53-independent ataxia telangiectasia and rad3 related protein (ATR) chromatin eviction.	Xiao G, Kue P, Bhosle R, Bargonetti J.	Interstrand crosslinks induce DNA replication fork stalling that in turn activates the ATR-dependent checkpoint and DNA repair on nuclear chromatin. Mitomycin C (MC) and Decarbamoyl Mitomycin C (DMC) induce different types of DNA crosslinks with DMC being a more cytotoxic agent. We previously reported that the novel DMC induced β-interstrand DNA crosslinks induce a p53-independent form of cell death. The p53-independent DMC cytotoxicity associates with the activation, and subsequent depletion, of Chk1. In this study we further dissect the novel DMC signal transduction pathway and asked how it influences chromatin-associated proteins. We found that treatment with DMC, but not MC, stimulated the disassociation of ATR from chromatin and re-localization of ATR to the cytoplasm. The chromatin eviction of ATR was coupled with the formation of nuclear Rad51 foci and the phosphorylation of Chk1. Furthermore, DMC but not MC, activated expression of gadd45α mRNA. Importantly, knocking down p53 via shRNA did not inhibit the DMC-induced disassociation of ATR from chromatin or reduce the activation of transcription of gadd45α. Our results suggest that DMC induces a p53-independent disassociation of ATR from chromatin that facilitates Chk1 checkpoint activation and Rad51 chromatin recruitment. Our findings provide evidence that ATR chromatin eviction in breast cancer cells is an area of study that should be focused on for inducing p53-independent cell death.
26088424	Effects of TNF-α on Cementoblast Differentiation, Mineralization, and Apoptosis.	Wang YL, He H, Liu ZJ, Cao ZG, Wang XY, Yang K, Fang Y, Han M, Zhang C, Huo FY.	Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is involved in various inflammatory processes, including periodontitis. Although the influences of TNF-α on periodontal ligament fibroblasts and osteoblasts have been widely documented, its effects on cementoblasts, the cells responsible for cementum production, remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that TNF-α suppressed the mineralization ability of cementoblasts by inhibiting differentiation and inducing apoptosis. Various signaling pathways, such as p53, PP2AC, p38, Erk1/2, JNK, PI3K-Akt, and NF-κB, were activated during this process. The use of a specific inhibitor and siRNA transfection confirmed that the effects of TNF-α on differentiation and apoptosis in cementoblasts were partially abrogated by inhibiting p53 activity. By contrast, the effects of TNF-α were even exacerbated by the inhibition of the p38, Erk1/2, JNK, PI3K-Akt, and NF-κB pathways. Moreover, p53 activity was further enhanced by blocking the p38, Erk1/2, JNK, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. Taken together, these results suggested that the differentiation inhibition and apoptosis in cementoblasts induced by TNF-α were partially dependent on p53 activity. The p38, Erk1/2, JNK, PI3K-Akt, and NF-κB pathways were also activated but acted as balancing players to limit rather than conduct the negative effects of TNF-α. These balancing effects were dependent, or at least partially dependent, on p53, except for the NF-κB pathway.
25347740	Apc and p53 interaction in DNA damage and genomic instability in hepatocytes.	Méniel V, Megges M, Young MA, Cole A, Sansom OJ, Clarke AR.	Disruption of Apc (adenomatous polyposis coli) within hepatocytes activates Wnt signalling, perturbs differentiation and ultimately leads to neoplasia. Apc negatively regulates Wnt signalling but is also involved in organizing the cytoskeleton and may have a role in chromosome segregation. In vitro studies have implicated Apc in the control of genomic stability. However, the relevance of this data has been questioned in vivo as Apc is lost earlier than the onset of genomic instability. Here we analyse the relationship between immediate loss of Apc and the acquisition of genomic instability in hepatocytes. We used Cre-lox technology to inactivate Apc and in combination with p53 in vivo, to define the consequences of gene loss on cell cycle regulation, proliferation, death and aneuploidy. We show that, although Apc loss leads to increased proliferation, it also leads to increased apoptosis, the accumulation of p53, p21 and markers of double-strand breaks and DNA repair. Flow cytometry revealed an increased 4N DNA content, consistent with a G2 arrest. Levels of anaphase bridges were also elevated, implicating failed chromosome segregation. This was accompanied by an increase in centrosome number, which demonstrates a role for Apc in maintaining euploidy. To address the role of p53 in these processes, we analysed combined loss of Apc and p53, which led to a further increase in proliferation, cell death, DNA damages and repair and a bypass of G2 arrest than was observed with Apc loss. However, we observed only a marginal effect on anaphase bridges and centrosome number, which could be due to increased cell death. Our data therefore establishes, in an in vivo setting, that APC loss leads to a DNA damage signature and genomic instability in the liver and that additional loss of p53 leads to an increase in the DNA damage signal but not to an immediate increase in the genomic instability phenotype.
25614517	Starvation promotes REV1 SUMOylation and p53-dependent sensitization of melanoma and breast cancer cells.	Shim HS, Wei M, Brandhorst S, Longo VD.	Short-term starvation or fasting can augment cancer treatment efficacy and can be effective in delaying cancer progression in the absence of chemotherapy, but the underlying molecular mechanisms of action remain elusive. Here, we describe the role of REV1, a specialized DNA polymerase involved in DNA repair, as an important signaling node linking nutrient sensing and metabolic control to cell fate. We show that REV1 is a novel binding partner of the tumor suppressor p53 and regulates its activity. Under starvation, REV1 is modified by SUMO2/3, resulting in the relief of REV1's inhibition of p53 and enhancing p53's effects on proapoptotic gene expression and apoptosis in breast cancer and melanoma cells. Thus, fasting in part through its effect on REV1 is a promising nontoxic strategy to increase p53-dependent cell death and to enhance the efficacy of cancer therapies.
24469051	Selective killing of lung cancer cells by miRNA-506 molecule through inhibiting NF-κB p65 to evoke reactive oxygen species generation and p53 activation.	Yin M, Ren X, Zhang X, Luo Y, Wang G, Huang K, Feng S, Bao X, Huang K, He X, Liang P, Wang Z, Tang H, He J, Zhang B.	The tumor suppressor p53, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) have crucial roles in tumorigenesis, although the mechanisms of cross talk between these factors remain largely unknown. Here we report that miR-506 upregulation occurs in 83% of lung cancer patients (156 cases), and its expression highly correlates with ROS. Ectopic expression of miR-506 inhibits NF-κB p65 expression, induces ROS accumulation and then activates p53 to suppress lung cancer cell viability, but not in normal cells. Interestingly, p53 promotes miR-506 expression level, indicating that miR-506 mediates cross talk between p53, NF-κB p65 and ROS. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-506 mimics inhibited tumorigenesis in vivo, implicating that miR-506 might be a potential therapeutic molecule for selective killing of lung cancer cells.
25316440	The prognostic significance of p53 expression in gastric cancer: a meta-analysis.	Wei K, Jiang L, Wei Y, Wang Y, Qian X, Dai Q, Guan Q.	OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis was conducted to quantitatively assess the prognostic significance of p53 expression in gastric cancer patients. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted to identify eligible studies in PubMed and Embase. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios (ORs) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to estimate the effect sizes. Moreover, meta-regression analysis and subgroup analysis were carried out. RESULTS: A total of 34 studies comprising 6,599 patients were subjected to final analysis. Positive/high p53 expression was significantly associated with poorer overall survival (HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.23-1.98) and disease-specific survival (HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.35-1.73). The results also indicated that positive/high p53 expression was significantly associated with gender (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.09-1.45), Lauren's classification (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.23-2.29), the depth of invasion (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.56-0.83), lymph node metastasis (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.23-1.97), TNM stage (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.47-0.69), vascular invasion (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.18-1.92) and lymphatic invasion (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.11-1.72), but not with Bormann type (OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.91-1.70), grade of differentiation (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.82-1.44) or distant metastasis (OR 1.37, 95% CI 0.92-2.03). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests positive/high p53 expression may be a useful biomarker to predict a poorer prognosis for patients with gastric cancer.
25827815	p53 signalling mediates acupuncture-induced neuroprotection in Parkinson's disease.	Park JY, Choi H, Baek S, Jang J, Lee A, Jeon S, Kim J, Park HJ.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with a selective loss of dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Recently, it has been demonstrated that acupuncture treatment has protective effects in PD. However, to date, the molecular mechanisms underlying acupuncture's effect on DA neuronal protection are largely unknown. In this study, we report that p53 signalling mediates the protective effects of acupuncture treatment in a mouse model of PD. We found that the acupuncture treatment in the mouse PD model results in significant recovery to the normal in the context of behaviour and molecular signatures. We found that the gene network associated with p53 signalling is closely involved in the protective effects of acupuncture treatment in PD. Consistent with this idea, we demonstrated that specific knockout of the p53 gene in the midbrain DA neurons abrogates the acupuncture induced protective effects in the mouse model of PD. Thus, these data suggest that p53 signalling mediates the protective effects of acupuncture treatment in PD.
25636963	Znf385C mediates a novel p53-dependent transcriptional switch to control timing of facial bone formation.	Hochgreb-Hägele T, Koo DE, Bronner ME.	Jaw formation involves an intricate series of molecular events, whereby a chondrogenic scaffold precedes osteogenesis. The mechanisms coupling timing of cartilage maturation to onset of bone differentiation are poorly understood, particularly for neural crest-derived bones of the head. Here we present a novel zebrafish gene/protein-trap Citrine-fusion line that reveals transient expression of the zinc-finger protein Znf385C in maturing chondrocytes of the jaw. Functional analysis shows that loss of Znf385C disrupts a distinct peak of p21(cip1/waf1) expression in the chondrocytes, as well as causes premature ossification of the zebrafish jaw. We find that Znf385C is expressed as two splice variants which act differentially to activate p21(cip1/waf1) and/or interact with p53 in subcellular compartments. Taken together, the results suggest that Znf385C acts as a developmental switch for p53 function that modulates cell cycle arrest of chondrocytes and regulates timing of jaw cartilage maturation and ossification.
24632606	Altered p53 regulation of miR-148b and p55PIK contributes to tumor progression in colorectal cancer.	Wang G, Cao X, Lai S, Luo X, Feng Y, Wu J, Ning Q, Xia X, Wang J, Gong J, Hu J.	MicroRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expressions of many genes. Previously, we found that the expression of p55PIK, an isoform of phosphatidylinosotol 3-kinase that has important roles in the regulation of cell cycle, is increased significantly in several types of cancer and contributes to the tumor growth. However, the mechanism for this increased p55PIK expression is not well understood. In this study, we show that miR-148b binds specifically to the 3'-untranslated region of p55PIK and significantly suppresses p55PIK expression. MiR-148b overexpression abolished p55PIK stimulation of cell proliferation and cell cycle progression in colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines and decreased tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated that p53 directly activates the transcription of miR-148b by binding to its promoter. In CRC cell lines and tissues, p53 expression was associated with miR-148b expression, and both were negatively associated with p55PIK expression. Our study shows that the p53/miR-148b/p55PIK axis has an important role in cell proliferation and tumor growth, and may represent a novel therapeutic target for treating cancers containing p53 mutations or losses.
25149358	CDK2 transcriptional repression is an essential effector in p53-dependent cellular senescence-implications for therapeutic intervention.	Zalzali H, Nasr B, Harajly M, Basma H, Ghamloush F, Ghayad S, Ghanem N, Evan GI, Saab R.	Cellular senescence, a form of cell-cycle arrest, is a tumor-suppressor mechanism triggered by multiple tumor-promoting insults, including oncogenic stress and DNA damage. The role of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) regulation has been evaluated in models of replicative senescence, but little is known regarding its role in other senescence settings. Using in vitro and in vivo models of DNA damage-and oncogene-induced cellular senescence, it was determined that activation of the tumor-suppressor protein p53 (TP53) resulted in repression of the CDK2 transcript that was dependent on intact RB. Ectopic CDK2 expression was sufficient to bypass p53-dependent senescence, and CDK2-specific inhibition, either pharmacologically (CVT313) or by use of a dominant-negative CDK2, was sufficient to induce early senescence. Pharmacologic inhibition of CDK2 in an in vivo model of pineal tumor decreased proliferation and promoted early senescence, and it also decreased tumor penetrance and prolonged time to tumor formation in animals lacking p53. In conclusion, for both oncogene- and DNA damage-induced cellular senescence, CDK2 transcript and protein are decreased in a p53- and RB-dependent manner, and this repression is necessary for cell-cycle exit during senescence.These data show that CDK2 inhibition may be useful for cancer prevention in premalignant hyperproliferative lesions, as well as established tumors.
25416806	Rpl22 Loss Impairs the Development of B Lymphocytes by Activating a p53-Dependent Checkpoint.	Fahl SP, Harris B, Coffey F, Wiest DL.	Although ribosomal proteins facilitate the ribosome’s core function of translation, emerging evidence suggests that some ribosomal proteins are also capable of performing tissue-restricted functions either from within specialized ribosomes or from outside of the ribosome. In particular, we have previously demonstrated that germline ablation of the gene encoding ribosomal protein Rpl22 causes a selective and p53-dependent arrest of ab T cell progenitors at the b-selection checkpoint. We have now identified a crucial role for Rpl22 during early B cell development. Germline ablation of Rpl22 results in a reduction in the absolute number of B-lineage progenitors in the bone marrow beginning at the pro–B cell stage. Although Rpl22-deficient pro–B cells are hyporesponsive to IL-7, a key cytokine required for early B cell development, the arrest of B cell development does not result from disrupted IL-7 signaling. Instead, p53 induction appears to be responsible for the developmental defects, as Rpl22 deficiency causes increased expression of p53 and activation of downstream p53 target genes, and p53 deficiency rescues the defect in B cell development in Rpl22-deficient mice. Interestingly, the requirement for Rpl22 in the B cell lineage appears to be developmentally restricted, because Rpl22-deficient splenic B cells proliferate normally in response to Ag receptor and Toll receptor stimuli and undergo normal class-switch recombination. These results indicate that Rpl22 performs a critical, developmentally restricted role in supporting early B cell development by preventing p53 induction.
26102034	Lafora disease proteins laforin and malin negatively regulate the HIPK2-p53 cell death pathway.	Upadhyay M, Gupta S, Bhadauriya P, Ganesh S.	Lafora disease (LD) is an autosomal recessive, progressive, and fatal form of a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of Lafora polyglucosan bodies. LD is caused by defects in either the laforin protein phosphatase or the malin E3 ubiquitin ligase. Laforin and malin were shown play key roles in proteolytic processes, unfolded stress response, and glycogen metabolism. Therefore, the LD proteins laforin and malin are thought to function as pro-survival factors and their loss thus could result in neurodegeneration. To understand the molecular pathway leading to the cell death in LD, in the present study, we investigated the possible role of LD proteins in the p53-mediated cell death pathway. We show that loss of laforin or malin results in the increased level and activity of p53, both in cellular and animal models of LD, and that this is primarily due to the increased levels of Hipk2, a proapoptotic activator of p53. Overexpression of laforin or malin confers protection against Hipk2-mediated cell death by targeting the Hipk2 to the cytoplasmic compartment. Taken together, our study strengthens the notion that laforin and malin are pro-survival factors, and that the activation of Hipk2-p53 cell death pathway might underlie neurodegeneration in LD.
26585176	An anthraquinone derivative from Luffa acutangula induces apoptosis in human lung cancer cell line NCI-H460 through p53-dependent pathway.	Vanajothi R, Srinivasan P.	The current study was designed to evaluate the in vitro antiproliferative activity of 1,8-dihydroxy-4-methylanthracene-9,10-dione (DHMA) isolated from the Luffa acutangula against human non-small cell lung cancer cell line (NCI-H460). Induction of apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was determined through fluorescence microscopic technique. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting analysis was carried out to detect the expression of pro-apoptotic (p53, p21, caspase-3, Bax, GADD45A, and ATM) and anti-apoptotic (NF-κB) proteins in NCI-H460 cell line. In silico studies also performed to predict the binding mechanism of DHMA with MDM2-p53 protein. The DHMA inhibited the cell viability of NCI-H460 cells in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of about 50 µg/ml. It significantly reduced cell viability correlated with induction of apoptosis, which was associated with ROS generation. The apoptotic cell death was further confirmed through dual staining and DNA fragmentation assay. DHMA significantly increased the expression of anti-apoptotic protein such as p53, p21, Bax, and caspase-3 but downregulated the expression of NF-κB in NCI-H460 cell line. In silico studies demonstrate that DHMA formed hydrogen bond interaction with key residues Trp26, Phe55 and Lys24 by which it disrupt the binding of p53 with MDM2 receptor. These findings suggested that DHMA induces apoptosis in NCI-H460 via a p53-dependent pathway. This the first study on cytotoxic and apoptosis inducing activity of DHMA from L. acutangula against NCI-H460 cell line. Therefore, DHMA has therapeutic potential for lung cancer treatment.
26494712	A chromatin-independent role of Polycomb-like 1 to stabilize p53 and promote cellular quiescence.	Brien GL, Healy E, Jerman E, Conway E, Fadda E, O'Donovan D, Krivtsov AV, Rice AM, Kearney CJ, Flaus A, McDade SS, Martin SJ, McLysaght A, O'Connell DJ, Armstrong SA, Bracken AP.	Polycomb-like proteins 1-3 (PCL1-3) are substoichiometric components of the Polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2) that are essential for association of the complex with chromatin. However, it remains unclear why three proteins with such apparent functional redundancy exist in mammals. Here we characterize their divergent roles in both positively and negatively regulating cellular proliferation. We show that while PCL2 and PCL3 are E2F-regulated genes expressed in proliferating cells, PCL1 is a p53 target gene predominantly expressed in quiescent cells. Ectopic expression of any PCL protein recruits PRC2 to repress the INK4A gene; however, only PCL2 and PCL3 confer an INK4A-dependent proliferative advantage. Remarkably, PCL1 has evolved a PRC2- and chromatin-independent function to negatively regulate proliferation. We show that PCL1 binds to and stabilizes p53 to induce cellular quiescence. Moreover, depletion of PCL1 phenocopies the defects in maintaining cellular quiescence associated with p53 loss. This newly evolved function is achieved by the binding of the PCL1 N-terminal PHD domain to the C-terminal domain of p53 through two unique serine residues, which were acquired during recent vertebrate evolution. This study illustrates the functional bifurcation of PCL proteins, which act in both a chromatin-dependent and a chromatin-independent manner to regulate the INK4A and p53 pathways.
26599530	Design and synthesis of a C7-aryl piperlongumine derivative with potent antimicrotubule and mutant p53-reactivating properties.	Punganuru SR, Madala HR, Venugopal SN, Samala R, Mikelis C, Srivenugopal KS.	Small molecules that can restore biological function to the p53 mutants found in human cancers have been highly sought to increase the anticancer efficacy. In efforts to generate hybrid anticancer drugs that can impact two or more targets simultaneously, we designed and developed piperlongumine (PL) derivatives with an aryl group inserted at the C-7 position. This insertion bestowed a combretastatin A4 (CA4, an established microtubule disruptor) like structure while retaining the piperlongumine configuration. The new compounds exhibited potent antiproliferative activities against eight cancer cell lines, in particular, were more cytotoxic against the SKBR-3 breast cancer cells which harbor a R175H mutation in p53 suppressor. KSS-9, a representative aryl PL chosen for further studies induced abundant ROS generation and protein glutathionylation. KSS-9 strongly disrupted the tubulin polymerization in vitro, destabilized the microtubules in cells and induced a potent G2/M cell cycle block. More interestingly, KSS-9 showed the ability to reactivate the p53 mutation and restore biological activity to the R175H mutant protein present in SKBR3 cells. Several procedures, including immunocytochemistry using conformation-specific antibodies for p53, immunoprecipitation combined with western blotting, electrophoretic shift mobility shift assays showed a reciprocal loss of mutant protein and generation of wild-type like protein. p53 reactivation was accompanied by the induction of the target genes, MDM2, p21cip1 and PUMA. Mechanistically, the redox-perturbation in cancer cells by the hybrid drug appears to underlie the p53 reactivation process. This anticancer drug approach merits further development.
25681390	Identification of novel radiation-induced p53-dependent transcripts extensively regulated during mouse brain development.	Quintens R, Verreet T, Janssen A, Neefs M, Leysen L, Michaux A, Verslegers M, Samari N, Pani G, Verheyde J, Baatout S, Benotmane MA.	Ionizing radiation is a potent activator of the tumor suppressor gene p53, which itself regulates the transcription of genes involved in canonical pathways such as the cell cycle, DNA repair and apoptosis as well as other biological processes like metabolism, autophagy, differentiation and development. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis on gene expression data from different in vivo and in vitro experiments to identify a signature of early radiation-responsive genes which were predicted to be predominantly regulated by p53. Moreover, we found that several genes expressed different transcript isoforms after irradiation in a p53-dependent manner. Among this gene signature, we identified novel p53 targets, some of which have not yet been functionally characterized. Surprisingly, in contrast to genes from the canonical p53-regulated pathways, our gene signature was found to be highly enriched during embryonic and post-natal brain development and during in vitro neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, we could show that for a number of genes, radiation-responsive transcript variants were upregulated during development and differentiation, while radiation non-responsive variants were not. This suggests that radiation exposure of the developing brain and immature cortical neurons results in the p53-mediated activation of a neuronal differentiation program. Overall, our results further increase the knowledge of the radiation-induced p53 network of the embryonic brain and provide more evidence concerning the importance of p53 and its transcriptional targets during mouse brain development.
25647692	Altered p53 and NOX1 activity cause bioenergetic defects in a SCA7 polyglutamine disease model.	Ajayi A, Yu X, Wahlo-Svedin C, Tsirigotaki G, Karlström V, Ström AL.	Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is one of the nine neurodegenerative disorders caused by expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) domains. Common pathogenic mechanisms, including bioenergetics defects, have been suggested for these so called polyQ diseases. However, the exact molecular mechanism(s) behind the metabolic dysfunction is still unclear. In this study we identified a previously unreported mechanism, involving disruption of p53 and NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1) activity, by which the expanded SCA7 disease protein ATXN7 causes metabolic dysregulation. The NOX1 protein is known to promote glycolytic activity, whereas the transcription factor p53 inhibits this process and instead promotes mitochondrial respiration. In a stable inducible PC12 model of SCA7, p53 and mutant ATXN7 co-aggregated and the transcriptional activity of p53 was reduced, resulting in a 50% decrease of key p53 target proteins, like AIF and TIGAR. In contrast, the expression of NOX1 was increased approximately 2 times in SCA7 cells. Together these alterations resulted in a decreased respiratory capacity, an increased reliance on glycolysis for energy production and a subsequent 20% reduction of ATP in SCA7 cells. Restoring p53 function, or suppressing NOX1 activity, both reversed the metabolic dysfunction and ameliorated mutant ATXN7 toxicity. These results hence not only enhance the understanding of the mechanisms causing metabolic dysfunction in SCA7 disease, but also identify NOX1 as a novel potential therapeutic target in SCA7 and possibly other polyQ diseases.
25912236	Ionizing radiation induces neuronal differentiation of Neuro-2a cells via PI3-kinase and p53-dependent pathways.	Eom HS, Park HR, Jo SK, Kim YS, Moon C, Jung U.	PURPOSE: The influence of ionizing radiation (IR) on neuronal differentiation is not well defined. In this study, we investigated the effects of IR on the differentiation of Neuro-2a mouse neuroblastoma cells and the involvement of tumor protein 53 (p53) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) during this process. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells were exposed to (137)Cs γ-rays at 4, 8 or 16 Gy. After incubation for 72 h with or without inhibitors of p53, phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) and other kinases, the neuronal differentiation of irradiated Neuro-2a cells was examined through analyzing neurite outgrowth and neuronal maker expression and the activation of related signaling proteins by western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Mouse primary neural stem cells (NSC) were exposed to IR at 1 Gy. The change of neuronal marker was examined using immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: The irradiation of Neuro-2a cells significantly increased the neurite outgrowth and the expression of neuronal markers (neuronal nuclei [NeuN], microtubule-associated protein 2 [Map2], growth associated protein-43 [GAP-43], and Ras-related protein 13 [Rab13]). Immunocytochemistry revealed that neuronal class III beta-tubulin (Tuj-1) positive cells were increased and nestin positive cells were decreased by IR in Neuro-2a cells, which supported the IR-induced neuronal differentiation. However, the IR-induced neuronal differentiation was significantly attenuated when p53 was inhibited by pifithrin-α (PFT-α) or p53-small interfering RNA (siRNA). The PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, also suppressed the IR-induced neurite outgrowth, the activation of p53, the expression of GAP-43 and Rab13, and the increase of Tuj-1 positive cells. The increase of neurite outgrowth and Tuj-1 positive cells by IR and its suppression by LY294002 were also observed in mouse primary NSC. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that IR is able to trigger the neuronal differentiation of Neuro-2a cells and the activation of p53 via PI3K is an important step for the IR-induced differentiation of Neuro-2a cells.
25362853	miR-34a-5p suppresses colorectal cancer metastasis and predicts recurrence in patients with stage II/III colorectal cancer.	Gao J, Li N, Dong Y, Li S, Xu L, Li X, Li Y, Li Z, Ng SS, Sung JJ, Shen L, Yu J.	Although surgery remains the mainstay of curative treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC), many patients still have high chance to experience disease relapse. It is therefore imperative to identify prognostic markers that can help predict the clinical outcomes of CRC. Aberrant microRNA expression holds great potential as diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for CRC. Here we aimed to investigate clinical potential of miR-34a-5p as a prognostic marker for CRC recurrence and its functional significance. First, we validated that miR-34a-5p was downregulated in CRC tumour tissues (P<0.05). The expression level of tissue miR-34a-5p was then evaluated in two independent cohorts of 268 CRC patients. miR-34a-5p expression was positively correlated with disease-free survival in two independent cohorts (cohort I: n=205, P<0.001; cohort II: n=63, P=0.006). Moreover, the expression of miR-34a-5p was an independent prognostic factor for CRC recurrence by multivariate analysis (P<0.001 for cohort I, P=0.007 for cohort II). Ectopic expression of miR-34a-5p in p53 wild-type colon cancer cell HCT116 significantly inhibited cell growth, migration, invasion and metastasis. miR-34a-5p induced cell apoptosis, cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and p53 transcription activity in HCT116 cells, but not in the HCT116 p53 knockout (p53(-/-)) cells. miR-34a-5p significantly suppressed the HCT116 growth in vivo, whereas it showed no effect on the HCT116 p53(-/-) xenograft, indicating that the growth-inhibiting effect by miR-34a-5p was dependent on p53. In addition, the expression level of miR-34a-5p in patients with p53-positive expression was higher than that in patients with p53-negative expression (P<0.01). In conclusion, miR-34a-5p inhibits recurrence of CRC through inhibiting cell growth, migration and invasion, inducing cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in a p53-dependent manner.
25305081	PINK1 positively regulates HDAC3 to suppress dopaminergic neuronal cell death.	Choi HK, Choi Y, Kang H, Lim EJ, Park SY, Lee HS, Park JM, Moon J, Kim YJ, Choi I, Joe EH, Choi KC, Yoon HG.	Deciphering the molecular basis of neuronal cell death is a central issue in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Dysregulation of p53 levels has been implicated in neuronal apoptosis. The role of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) in suppressing p53-dependent apoptosis has been recently emphasized; however, the molecular basis of modulation of p53 function by HDAC3 remains unclear. Here we show that PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), which is linked to autosomal recessive early-onset familial Parkinson's disease, phosphorylates HDAC3 at Ser-424 to enhance its HDAC activity in a neural cell-specific manner. PINK1 prevents H2O2-induced C-terminal cleavage of HDAC3 via phosphorylation of HDAC3 at Ser-424, which is reversed by protein phosphatase 4c. PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of HDAC3 enhances its direct association with p53 and causes subsequent hypoacetylation of p53. Genetic deletion of PINK1 partly impaired the suppressive role of HDAC3 in regulating p53 acetylation and transcriptional activity. However, depletion of HDAC3 fully abolished the PINK1-mediated p53 inhibitory loop. Finally, ectopic expression of phosphomometic-HDAC3(S424E) substantially overcomes the defective action of PINK1 against oxidative stress in dopaminergic neuronal cells. Together, our results uncovered a mechanism by which PINK1-HDAC3 network mediates p53 inhibitory loop in response to oxidative stress-induced damage.
25651062	An acetyl-methyl switch drives a conformational change in p53.	Tong Q, Mazur SJ, Rincon-Arano H, Rothbart SB, Kuznetsov DM, Cui G, Liu WH, Gete Y, Klein BJ, Jenkins L, Mer G, Kutateladze AG, Strahl BD, Groudine M, Appella E, Kutateladze TG.	Individual posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of p53 mediate diverse p53-dependent responses; however, much less is known about the combinatorial action of adjacent modifications. Here, we describe crosstalk between the early DNA damage response mark p53K382me2 and the surrounding PTMs that modulate binding of p53 cofactors, including 53BP1 and p300. The 1.8 Å resolution crystal structure of the tandem Tudor domain (TTD) of 53BP1 in complex with p53 peptide acetylated at K381 and dimethylated at K382 (p53K381acK382me2) reveals that the dual PTM induces a conformational change in p53. The α-helical fold of p53K381acK382me2 positions the side chains of R379, K381ac, and K382me2 to interact with TTD concurrently, reinforcing a modular design of double PTM mimetics. Biochemical and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses show that other surrounding PTMs, including phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues of p53, affect association with TTD. Our findings suggest a novel PTM-driven conformation switch-like mechanism that may regulate p53 interactions with binding partners.
25265062	Studying p53 family proteins in yeast: induction of autophagic cell death and modulation by interactors and small molecules.	Leão M, Gomes S, Bessa C, Soares J, Raimundo L, Monti P, Fronza G, Pereira C, Saraiva L.	In this work, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used to individually study human p53, p63 (full length and truncated forms) and p73. Using this cell system, the effect of these proteins on cell proliferation and death, and the influence of MDM2 and MDMX on their activities were analyzed. When expressed in yeast, wild-type p53, TAp63, ΔNp63 and TAp73 induced growth inhibition associated with S-phase cell cycle arrest. This growth inhibition was accompanied by reactive oxygen species production and autophagic cell death. Furthermore, they stimulated rapamycin-induced autophagy. On the contrary, none of the tested p53 family members induced apoptosis either per se or after apoptotic stimuli. As previously reported for p53, also TAp63, ΔNp63 and TAp73 increased actin expression levels and its depolarization, suggesting that ACT1 is also a p63 and p73 putative yeast target gene. Additionally, MDM2 and MDMX inhibited the activity of all tested p53 family members in yeast, although the effect was weaker on TAp63. Moreover, Nutlin-3a and SJ-172550 were identified as potential inhibitors of the p73 interaction with MDM2 and MDMX, respectively. Altogether, the yeast-based assays herein developed can be envisaged as a simplified cell system to study the involvement of p53 family members in autophagy, the modulation of their activities by specific interactors (MDM2 and MDMX), and the potential of new small molecules to modulate these interactions.
26181367	Stress-mediated Sin3B activation leads to negative regulation of subset of p53 target genes.	Kadamb R, Mittal S, Bansal N, Saluja D.	The multiprotein SWI-independent 3 (Sin3)-HDAC (histone deacetylase) corepressor complex mediates gene repression through its interaction with DNA-binding factors and recruitment of chromatin-modifying proteins on to the promoters of target gene. Previously, an increased expression of Sin3B and tumour suppressor protein, p53 has been established upon adriamycin treatment. We, now provide evidence that Sin3B expression is significantly up-regulated under variety of stress conditions and this response is not stress-type specific. We observed that Sin3B expression is significantly up-regulated both at transcript and at protein level upon DNA damage induced by bleomycin drug, a radiomimetic agent. This increase in Sin3B expression upon stress is found to be p53-dependent and is associated with enhanced interaction of Sin3B with Ser(15) phosphorylated p53. Binding of Sin3-HDAC repressor complex on to the promoters of p53 target genes influences gene regulation by altering histone modifications (H3K9me3 and H3K27me3) at target genes. Furthermore, knockdown of Sin3B by shRNA severely compromises p53-mediated gene repression under stress conditions. Taken together, these results suggest that stress-induced Sin3B activation is p53-dependent and is essential for p53-mediated repression of its selective target genes. The present study has an implication in understanding the transrepression mechanism of p53 under DNA damaging conditions.
25293814	X-ray and ultraviolet C irradiation-induced γ-H2AX and p53 formation in normal human periosteal cells in vitro: markers for quality control in cell therapy.	Kawase T, Kamiya M, Hayama K, Nagata M, Okuda K, Yoshie H, Burns DM, Tsuchimochi M, Nakata K.	BACKGROUND AIMS: For successful cell transplantation therapy, the quality of cells must be strictly controlled. Unfortunately, to exclude inappropriate cells that possess structurally abnormal chromosomes, currently only karyotyping functions as an assessment. Unfortunately, this methodology is time-consuming and only effective for metaphasic cells. To develop a more efficient, inclusive and sensitive methodology, we examined the phosphorylation of histone H2AX and the p53 levels in normal human periosteal cells exposed to x-rays or other oxidative stressors. METHODS: Periosteal cells were obtained from human alveolar bone before being exposed to x-rays, ultraviolet C or hydrogen peroxide. The cell cycle, electric nuclear volume and CD44 expression were evaluated using flow cytometry, and the phosphorylated H2AX (γ-H2AX), p53, p21 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) levels were evaluated by Western blot analyses. RESULTS: Each oxidative stress dose-dependently arrested cell growth and partially induced premature cellular senescence. In parallel, each oxidative stress rapidly phosphorylated H2AX and stabilized p53, and intense stress sustained these high levels for at least 8 days. CONCLUSIONS: Intensive oxidative stress induces sustained high levels of γ-H2AX and p53, which force cells toward senescence or non-apoptotic cell death. Lower doses of oxidative stress induced more modest and transient increases in γ-H2AX and p53, and these cells eventually survive. However, because DNA is repaired without a template in the majority of these cells, G1 mutations accumulate. Therefore, we recommend that any cell population expressing elevated γ-H2AX and p53 levels be excluded from cell transplantation therapy.
25512378	Oxidative stress-induced inhibition of Sirt1 by caveolin-1 promotes p53-dependent premature senescence and stimulates the secretion of interleukin 6 (IL-6).	Volonte D, Zou H, Bartholomew JN, Liu Z, Morel PA, Galbiati F.	Oxidative stress can induce premature cellular senescence. Senescent cells secrete various growth factors and cytokines, such as IL-6, that can signal to the tumor microenvironment and promote cancer cell growth. Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) is a class III histone deacetylase that regulates a variety of physiological processes, including senescence. We found that caveolin-1, a structural protein component of caveolar membranes, is a direct binding partner of Sirt1, as shown by the binding of the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1 (amino acids 82-101) to the caveolin-binding domain of Sirt1 (amino acids 310-317). Our data show that oxidative stress promotes the sequestration of Sirt1 into caveolar membranes and the interaction of Sirt1 with caveolin-1, which lead to inhibition of Sirt1 activity. Reactive oxygen species stimulation promotes acetylation of p53 and premature senescence in wild-type but not caveolin-1 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Either down-regulation of Sirt1 expression or re-expression of caveolin-1 in caveolin-1 null MEFs restores reactive oxygen species-induced acetylation of p53 and premature senescence. In addition, overexpression of caveolin-1 induces stress induced premature senescence in p53 wild-type but not p53 knockout MEFs. Phosphorylation of caveolin-1 on tyrosine 14 promotes the sequestration of Sirt1 into caveolar membranes and activates p53/senescence signaling. We also identified IL-6 as a caveolin-1-specific cytokine that is secreted by senescent fibroblasts following the caveolin-1-mediated inhibition of Sirt1. The caveolin-1-mediated secretion of IL-6 by senescent fibroblasts stimulates the growth of cancer cells. Therefore, by inhibiting Sirt1, caveolin-1 links free radicals to the activation of the p53/senescence pathway and the protumorigenic properties of IL-6.
26099430	Pure versus combined Merkel cell carcinomas: immunohistochemical evaluation of cellular proteins (p53, Bcl-2, and c-kit) reveals significant overexpression of p53 in combined tumors.	Lai JH, Fleming KE, Ly TY, Pasternak S, Godlewski M, Doucette S, Walsh NM.	Merkel cell polyomavirus is of oncogenic significance in approximately 80% of Merkel cell carcinomas. Morphological subcategories of the tumor differ in regard to viral status, the rare combined type being uniformly virus negative and the predominant pure type being mainly virus positive. Indications that different biological subsets of the tumor exist led us to explore this diversity. In an Eastern Canadian cohort of cases (75 patients; mean age, 76 years [range, 43-91]; male/female ratio, 43:32; 51 [68%] pure and 24 [34%] combined tumors), we semiquantitatively compared the immunohistochemical expression of 3 cellular proteins (p53, Bcl-2, and c-kit) in pure versus combined groups. Viral status was known in a subset of cases. The significant overexpression of p53 in the combined group (mean [SD], 153.8 [117.8] versus 121.6 [77.9]; P = .01) and the increased epidermal expression of this protein (p53 patches) in the same group lend credence to a primary etiologic role for sun damage in these cases. Expression of Bcl-2 and c-kit did not differ significantly between the 2 morphological groups. A relative increase in c-kit expression was significantly associated with a virus-negative status (median [interquartile range], 100 [60-115] versus 70 [0-100]; P = .03). Emerging data reveal divergent biological pathways in Merkel cell carcinoma, each with a characteristic immunohistochemical profile. Virus-positive tumors (all pure) exhibit high retinoblastoma protein and low p53 expression, whereas virus-negative cases (few pure and all combined) show high p53 and relatively high c-kit expression. The potential biological implications of this dichotomy call for consistent stratification of these tumors in future studies.
25996291	Che-1 modulates the decision between cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by its binding to p53.	Desantis A, Bruno T, Catena V, De Nicola F, Goeman F, Iezzi S, Sorino C, Gentileschi MP, Germoni S, Monteleone V, Pellegrino M, Kann M, De Meo PD, Pallocca M, Höpker K, Moretti F, Mattei E, Reinhardt HC, Floridi A, Passananti C, Benzing T, Blandino G, Fanciulli M.	The tumor suppressor p53 is mainly involved in the transcriptional regulation of a large number of growth-arrest- and apoptosis-related genes. However, a clear understanding of which factor/s influences the choice between these two opposing p53-dependent outcomes remains largely elusive. We have previously described that in response to DNA damage, the RNA polymerase II-binding protein Che-1/AATF transcriptionally activates p53. Here, we show that Che-1 binds directly to p53. This interaction essentially occurs in the first hours of DNA damage, whereas it is lost when cells undergo apoptosis in response to posttranscriptional modifications. Moreover, Che-1 sits in a ternary complex with p53 and the oncosuppressor Brca1. Accordingly, our analysis of genome-wide chromatin occupancy by p53 revealed that p53/Che1 interaction results in preferential transactivation of growth arrest p53 target genes over its pro-apoptotic target genes. Notably, exposure of Che-1(+/-) mice to ionizing radiations resulted in enhanced apoptosis of thymocytes, compared with WT mice. These results confirm Che-1 as an important regulator of p53 activity and suggest Che-1 to be a promising yet attractive drug target for cancer therapy.
26029996	Sensitivity to cdk1-inhibition is modulated by p53 status in preclinical models of embryonal tumors.	Schwermer M, Lee S, Köster J, van Maerken T, Stephan H, Eggert A, Morik K, Schulte JH, Schramm A.	Dysregulation of the cell cycle and cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) is a hallmark of cancer cells. Intervention with cdk function is currently evaluated as a therapeutic option in many cancer types including neuroblastoma (NB), a common solid tumor of childhood. Re-analyses of mRNA profiling data from primary NB revealed that high level mRNA expression of both cdk1 and its corresponding cyclin, CCNB1, were significantly associated with worse patient outcome independent of MYCN amplification, a strong indicator of adverse NB prognosis. Cdk1 as well as CCNB1 expression were readily detectable in all embryonal tumor cell lines investigated. Pharmacological inhibition or siRNA-mediated knockdown of cdk1/CCNB1 induced proliferation arrest independent of MYCN status in NB cells. Sensitivity to cdk1 inhibition was modulated by TP53, which was demonstrated using isogenic cells with wild-type TP53 expressing either dominant-negative p53 or a short hairpin RNA directed against TP53. Apoptosis induced by cdk1 inhibition was dependent on caspase activation and was concomitant with upregulation of transcriptional targets of TP53. Our results confirm an essential role for the cdk1/CCNB1 complex in tumor cell survival. As relapsing embryonal tumors often present with p53 pathway alterations, these findings have potential implications for therapy approaches targeting cdks.
26101637	Prognostic role of p53 and Ki-67 immunohistochemical expression in patients with surgically resected lung adenocarcinoma: a retrospective study.	Kim CH, Lee HS, Park JH, Choi JH, Jang SH, Park YB, Lee MG, Hyun IG, Kim KI, Kim HS, Cho SW, Lee WY, Kim EJ, Kim H, Shim JW, Choi YH.	OBJECTIVE: p53 mutations and the Ki-67 protein are frequently observed in various types of human cancer; the abnormal expression of p53 and Ki-67 in the tumor is associated with poor survival of lung cancer patients. We aimed to assess the prognostic role of immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of p53 and Ki-67 in lung adenocarcinoma tissue. METHODS: Tumor samples from 136 patients who had undergone surgical resection for lung adenocarcinoma were retrospectively evaluated for p53 and Ki-67 expression by immunohistochemistry. Associations of clinical and pathologic variables with p53 and Ki-67 were determined using the χ(2) test. After excluding two patients (follow-up loss), 134 cases were evaluated for associations between p53, Ki-67, clinical and pathologic variables, and survival by using the Cox proportional hazards regression model and Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: In the 136 patients, p53 was positive in 71.0% (93/131), and Ki-67 showed high in 49.2% (61/124). Unlike p53, Ki-67 was associated with male sex, smoking, and poor tumor differentiation (P=0.004, P=0.001 and P=0.006). Of these, poor tumor differentiation strongly was correlated with high level of Ki-67 expression (P=0.008). Neither p53 nor Ki-67 was associated with increased risk of death (P=0.318, P=0.053); however, age ≥60 years and lymph node involvement were significant predictors of death (P=0.039 and P=0.042). The log-rank test revealed a significant association between Ki-67 and lower survival in all patients (χ(2)=5637; P=0.018); however, the risk was limited to stage III cases (χ(2)=5.939; P=0.015). Unlike p53, patients with high level of Ki-67 expression showed lower 3-year actuarial survival than those without (log-rank test, χ(2)=4.936; P=0.026). CONCLUSIONS: IHC expression of Ki-67 in lung adenocarcinoma tissue shows stronger association with poor tumor differentiation, and negatively affects patients' survival in advanced-stage lung cancer; however, the role of p53 on patient outcome needs further study.
25786345	p53-dependent expression of CXCR5 chemokine receptor in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.	Mitkin NA, Hook CD, Schwartz AM, Biswas S, Kochetkov DV, Muratova AM, Afanasyeva MA, Kravchenko JE, Bhattacharyya A, Kuprash DV.	Elevated expression of chemokine receptors in tumors has been reported in many instances and is related to a number of survival advantages for tumor cells including abnormal activation of prosurvival intracellular pathways. In this work we demonstrated an inverse correlation between expression levels of p53 tumor suppressor and CXCR5 chemokine receptor in MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line. Lentiviral transduction of MCF-7 cells with p53 shRNA led to elevated CXCR5 at both mRNA and protein levels. Functional activity of CXCR5 in p53-knockdown MCF-7 cells was also increased as shown by activation of target gene expression and chemotaxis in response to B-lymphocyte chemoattractant CXCL13. Using deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of the cxcr5 gene promoter and enhancer elements, we demonstrated that p53 appears to act upon cxcr5 promoter indirectly, by repressing the activity of NFκB transcription factors. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter gene analysis, we further demonstrated that p65/RelA was able to bind the cxcr5 promoter in p53-dependent manner and to directly transactivate it when overexpressed. Through the described mechanism, elevated CXCR5 expression may contribute to abnormal cell survival and migration in breast tumors that lack functional p53.
26125596	Analytical Validation of AmpliChip p53 Research Test for Archival Human Ovarian FFPE Sections.	Marton MJ, McNamara AR, Nikoloff DM, Nakao A, Cheng J.	The p53 tumor suppressor gene (TP53) is reported to be mutated in nearly half of all tumors and plays a central role in genome integrity. Detection of mutations in p53 can be accomplished by many assays, including the AmpliChip p53 Research Test. The AmpliChip p53 Research Test has been successfully used to determine p53 status in hematologic malignancies and fresh frozen solid tissues but there are few reports of using the assay with formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. The objective of this study was to describe analytical performance characterization of the AmpliChip p53 Research Test to detect p53 mutations in genomic DNA isolated from archival FFPE human ovarian tumor tissues. Method correlation with sequencing showed 96% mutation-wise agreement and 99% chip-wise agreement. We furthermore observed 100% agreement (113/113) of the most prevalent TP53 mutations. Workflow reproducibility was 96.8% across 8 samples, with 2 operators, 2 reagent lots and 2 instruments. Section-to-section reproducibility was 100% for each sample across a 60 μm region of the FFPE block from ovarian tumors. These data indicate that the AmpliChip p53 Research Test is an accurate and reproducible method for detecting mutations in TP53 from archival FFPE human ovarian specimens.
25778922	NORE1A is a Ras senescence effector that controls the apoptotic/senescent balance of p53 via HIPK2.	Donninger H, Calvisi DF, Barnoud T, Clark J, Schmidt ML, Vos MD, Clark GJ.	The Ras oncoprotein is a key driver of cancer. However, Ras also provokes senescence, which serves as a major barrier to Ras-driven transformation. Ras senescence pathways remain poorly characterized. NORE1A is a novel Ras effector that serves as a tumor suppressor. It is frequently inactivated in tumors. We show that NORE1A is a powerful Ras senescence effector and that down-regulation of NORE1A suppresses senescence induction by Ras and enhances Ras transformation. We show that Ras induces the formation of a complex between NORE1A and the kinase HIPK2, enhancing HIPK2 association with p53. HIPK2 is a tumor suppressor that can induce either proapoptotic or prosenescent posttranslational modifications of p53. NORE1A acts to suppress its proapoptotic phosphorylation of p53 but enhance its prosenescent acetylation of p53. Thus, we identify a major new Ras signaling pathway that links Ras to the control of specific protein acetylation and show how NORE1A allows Ras to qualitatively modify p53 function to promote senescence.
25544776	The anti-leukemic activity of sodium dichloroacetate in p53mutated/null cells is mediated by a p53-independent ILF3/p21 pathway.	Agnoletto C, Brunelli L, Melloni E, Pastorelli R, Casciano F, Rimondi E, Rigolin GM, Cuneo A, Secchiero P, Zauli G.	B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patients harboring p53 mutations are invariably refractory to therapies based on purine analogues and have limited treatment options and poor survival. Having recently demonstrated that the mitochondria-targeting small molecule sodium dichloroacetate (DCA) exhibits anti-leukemic activity in p53wild-type B-CLL cells, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of DCA in p53mutated B-CLL cells and in p53mutated/null leukemic cell lines. DCA exhibited comparable cytotoxicity in p53wild-type and p53mutated B-CLL patient cell cultures, as well as in p53mutated B leukemic cell lines (MAVER, MEC-1, MEC-2). At the molecular level, DCA promoted the transcriptional induction of p21 in all leukemic cell types investigated, including p53null HL-60. By using a proteomic approach, we demonstrated that DCA up-regulated the ILF3 transcription factor, which is a known regulator of p21 expression. The role of the ILF3/p21 axis in mediating the DCA anti-leukemic activity was underscored by knocking-down experiments. Indeed, transfection with ILF3 and p21 siRNAs significantly decreased both the DCA-induced p21 expression and the DCA-mediated cytotoxicity. Taken together, our results emphasize that DCA is a small molecule that merits further evaluation as a therapeutic agent also for p53mutated leukemic cells, by acting through the induction of a p53-independent pathway.
25821638	Modelling the p53/p66Shc Aging Pathway in the Shortest Living Vertebrate Nothobranchius Furzeri.	Priami C, De Michele G, Cotelli F, Cellerino A, Giorgio M, Pelicci PG, Migliaccio E.	Oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) increases during lifespan and is involved in aging processes. The p66Shc adaptor protein is a master regulator of oxidative stress response in mammals. Ablation of p66Shc enhances oxidative stress resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Most importantly, it has been demonstrated that its deletion retards aging in mice. Recently, new insights in the molecular mechanisms involving p66Shc and the p53 tumor suppressor genes were given: a specific p66Shc/p53 transcriptional regulation pathway was uncovered as determinant in oxidative stress response and, likely, in aging. p53, in a p66Shc-dependent manner, negatively downregulates the expression of 200 genes which are involved in the G2/M transition of mitotic cell cycle and are downregulated during physiological aging. p66Shc modulates the response of p53 by activating a p53 isoform (p44/p53, also named Delta40p53). Based on these latest results, several developments are expected in the future, as the generation of animal models to study aging and the evaluation of the use of the p53/p66Shc target genes as biomarkers in aging related diseases. The aim of this review is to investigate the conservation of the p66Shc and p53 role in oxidative stress between fish and mammals. We propose to approach this study trough a new model organism, the annual fish Nothobranchius furzeri, that has been demonstrated to develop typical signs of aging, like in mammals, including senescence, neurodegeneration, metabolic disorders and cancer.
26129908	Combined HDAC1 and HDAC2 Depletion Promotes Retinal Ganglion Cell Survival After Injury Through Reduction of p53 Target Gene Expression.	Lebrun-Julien F, Suter U.	Histones deacetylases (HDACs), besides their function as epigenetic regulators, deacetylate and critically regulate the activity of nonhistone targets. In particular, HDACs control partially the proapoptotic activity of p53 by balancing its acetylation state. HDAC inhibitors have revealed neuroprotective properties in different models, but the exact mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. We have generated a conditional knockout mouse model targeting retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) to investigate specifically the functional role of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in an acute model of optic nerve injury. Our results demonstrate that combined HDAC1 and HDAC2 ablation promotes survival of axotomized RGCs. Based on global gene expression analyses, we identified the p53-PUMA apoptosis-inducing axis to be strongly activated in axotomized mouse RGCs. Specific HDAC1/2 ablation inhibited this apoptotic pathway by impairing the crucial acetylation status of p53 and reducing PUMA expression, thereby contributing to the ensuing enhanced neuroprotection due to HDAC1/2 depletion. HDAC1/2 inhibition and the affected downstream signaling components emerge as specific targets for developing therapeutic strategies in neuroprotection.
26214628	Assessment and biological significance of JC polyomavirus in colorectal cancer in Tunisia.	Ksiaa F, Allous A, Ziadi S, Mokni M, Trimeche M.	PURPOSE: Several reports have indicated the presence of JC polyomavirus (JCV) in many human tumors, including colorectal cancers (CRCs). The presence of JCV infection in CRC patients has not been investigated in African countries. METHODS: We examined the prevalence and the biological significance of JCV in Tunisian CRC patients. The presence of JCV was assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a series of 105 CRCs and 89 paired non-tumor colonic mucosa samples from Tunisian patients. Results were correlated with the clinicopathological features and immunohistochemical expression of β-catenin, p53, and the proliferation marker Ki-67. RESULTS: JCV DNA was detected in 58.1% (61/105) of CRC and in only 14.6% (13/89) of paired non tumor colonic mucosa samples (p=0.03). The presence of JCV was significantly correlated with tumor differentiation (p=0.03). Moreover, JCV presence was significantly correlated with nuclear accumulation of β-catenin (p=0.008) and p53 accumulation (p=0.0001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that tumor differentiation, β-catenin and p53 accumulation were independent parameters significantly associated with the presence of JCV in CRC (p=0.04; p=0.05; p=0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: We support a role of JCV in colorectal carcinogenesis in Tunisian patients, especially of well differentiated morphology.
26277390	PEDF attenuates hypoxia-induced apoptosis and necrosis in H9c2 cells by inhibiting p53 mitochondrial translocation via PEDF-R.	Wang X, Zhang Y, Lu P, Zhang H, Li Y, Dong H, Zhang Z.	Pigment epithelial-derived factor (PEDF) is a multifunctional secreted glycoprotein, which could protect against hypoxia-induced cell death related to its anti-oxidative effect in cultured cardiomyocytes. However, the pathway mediating this cytoprotective process has not been fully established. Here we confirmed that PEDF bound to pigment epithelial-derived factor receptor (PEDF-R) expressed on the membrane of H9c2 cells. Under hypoxic condition, PEDF increased the ratio of MDM2:p53, so as to inhibited p53 mitochondrial translocation via PEDF-R. As a result, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening were inhibited, meanwhile cleaved caspase-3, PARP and the release of HMGB1 were reduced. Accordingly, apoptosis and necrosis were attenuated simultaneously. We conclude that PEDF-R mediates PEDF attenuates hypoxia-induced apoptosis and necrosis in H9c2 cells by inhibiting p53 mitochondrial translocation.
26279702	Influence of parameter values on the oscillation sensitivities of two p53-Mdm2 models.	Cuba CE, Valle AR, Ayala-Charca G, Villota ER, Coronado AM.	Biomolecular networks that present oscillatory behavior are ubiquitous in nature. While some design principles for robust oscillations have been identified, it is not well understood how these oscillations are affected when the kinetic parameters are constantly changing or are not precisely known, as often occurs in cellular environments. Many models of diverse complexity level, for systems such as circadian rhythms, cell cycle or the p53 network, have been proposed. Here we assess the influence of hundreds of different parameter sets on the sensitivities of two configurations of a well-known oscillatory system, the p53 core network. We show that, for both models and all parameter sets, the parameter related to the p53 positive feedback, i.e. self-promotion, is the only one that presents sizeable sensitivities on extrema, periods and delay. Moreover, varying the parameter set values to change the dynamical characteristics of the response is more restricted in the simple model, whereas the complex model shows greater tunability. These results highlight the importance of the presence of specific network patterns, in addition to the role of parameter values, when we want to characterize oscillatory biochemical systems.
26294168	Anti-cancer activity of trans-chalcone in osteosarcoma: Involvement of Sp1 and p53.	Silva G, Marins M, Fachin AL, Lee SH, Baek SJ.	Osteosarcoma is the most common bone cancer. Although the emergence of multidrug therapies has improved available treatments for osteosarcoma, approximately 30% of patients will still develop metastasis. Currently, much anticancer therapy uses drugs that affect oncogenes/tumor suppressor genes, such as p53 (up-regulation) and Sp1 (down-regulation). Chalcones are secondary metabolites of plants and have been demonstrated to induce apoptosis in human cancer cells. Building on this knowledge, we evaluated the ability of trans-chalcone to reduce viability, to induce apoptosis, and to alter gene expression of p53 and Sp1 in human osteosarcoma cell lines. We found that treatment of trans-chalcone inhibited growth of osteosarcoma cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with significant inhibition at 10 μM after 48 h; apoptosis was also induced in a dose-dependent manner, with 1.9- and 3.6-fold induction at 10 μM and 50 μM, respectively, compared to non-treated cells. Further experiments suggest that trans-chalcone affected Sp1 down-regulation at the transcriptional level, whereas trans-chalcone up-regulated p53 expression at the post-translational level. trans-chalcone and its derivatives could be important in the development of future clinical trials in osteosarcoma. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
26354682	Hypoxia Promotes Synergy between Mitomycin C and Bortezomib through a Coordinated Process of Bcl-xL Phosphorylation and Mitochondrial Translocation of p53.	Song X, Dilly AK, Choudry HA, Bartlett DL, Kwon YT, Lee YJ.	Colorectal peritoneal carcinomatosis (CPC) exhibits severe tumor hypoxia, leading to drug resistance and disease aggressiveness. This study demonstrates that the combination of the chemotherapeutic agent mitomycin C with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib induced synergistic cytotoxicity and apoptosis, which was even more effective under hypoxia in colorectal cancer cells. The combination of mitomycin C and bortezomib at sub-lethal doses induced activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and resulted in Bcl-xL phosphorylation at Serine 62, leading to dissociation of Bcl-xL from pro-apoptotic Bak. Interestingly, the intracellular level of p53 became elevated and p53 translocated to the mitochondria during the combinatorial treatment, in particular under hypoxia. The coordinated action of Bcl-xL phosphorylation and p53 translocation to the mitochondria resulted in conformational activation of Bak oligomerization, facilitating cytochrome c release and apoptosis induction. In addition, the combinatorial treatment with mitomycin C and bortezomib significantly inhibited intraperitoneal tumor growth in LS174T cells and increased apoptosis, especially under hypoxic conditions in vivo. This study provides a preclinical rationale for the use of combination therapies for CPC patients. IMPLICATIONS: The combination of a chemotherapy agent and proteasome inhibitor at sub-lethal doses induced synergistic apoptosis, in particular under hypoxia, in vitro and in vivo through coordinated action of Bcl-xL and p53 on Bak activation.
25837273	Scopoletin has a potential activity for anti-aging via autophagy in human lung fibroblasts.	Nam H, Kim MM.	Autophagy was known to be associated with aging in addition to cancer and neurodegeneration. The effects of scopoletin on autophagy and anti-aging were investigated in human lung fibroblast cell line, IMR 90. Here we show that scopoletin induces autophagy. It is also identified that the modulation of p53 by scopoletin are related to the induction of autophagy. Moreover, the level of SA-β-Gal staining, an aging marker, is reduced by scopoletin. In addition, while the expression levels of histone deacetylases such as HDAC1, SIRT1 and SIRT6 are increased in IMR 90 cells in the presence of scopoletin, the expression levels of histone acetyltransferases are decreased. Furthermore, scopoletin enhances the level of transcription factors such as Nrf-2and p-FoxO1 related to anti-aging. In addition, scopoletin modulates the reprogramming proteins. Therefore, these findings suggest that scopoletin could exert a positive effect on anti-aging related to autophagy through modulation of p53 in human lung fibroblasts.
24616007	Divergence of P53, PTEN, PI3K, Akt and mTOR expression in tonsillar cancer.	Chun SH, Jung CK, Won HS, Kang JH, Kim YS, Kim MS.	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate expression differences of p53, PTEN, PI3K, Akt and mTOR according to the human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and to evaluate clinical significance as prognostic markers in patients with locally advanced tonsillar cancer. METHODS: Sixty-five patients were reviewed. Tissue microarrays were prepared from surgical specimens and stained with antibodies against p53, PTEN, PIK3CA, Akt and mTOR. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were HPV-positive. Expression of P53 as well as PIK3CA, Akt and mTOR were not significantly different between the 2 groups. However, total PTEN (nuclear and cytoplasmic PTEN) expression was significantly frequent in HPV-positive group. Both overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were significantly different between the 2 groups. Nuclear PTEN expression in the cancer area and pathological nodal stage were significantly correlated with DFS. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the presence of PTEN expression with predisposition to nucleus more frequently observed in HPV-positive tonsillar cancers are significantly associated with favorable survival outcome, independent of activated PI3K/Akt/mTOR cell survival pathway.
24975555	Molecular mechanisms of low dose ionizing radiation-induced hormesis, adaptive responses, radioresistance, bystander effects, and genomic instability.	Tang FR, Loke WK.	PURPOSES: To review research progress on the molecular mechanisms of low dose ionizing radiation (LDIR)-induced hormesis, adaptive responses, radioresistance, bystander effects, and genomic instability in order to provide clues for therapeutic approaches to enhance biopositive effects (defined as radiation-induced beneficial effects to the organism), and control bionegative effects (defined as radiation-induced harmful effects to the organism) and related human diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Experimental studies have indicated that Ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM), extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phospho-c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) and protein 53 (P53)-related signal transduction pathways may be involved in LDIR-induced hormesis; MAPK, P53 may be important for adaptive response; ATM, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), ERK, JNK, reactive oxygen species (ROS), P53 for radioresistance; COX-2, ERK, MAPK, ROS, tumor necrosis factor receptor alpha (TNFα) for LDIR-induced bystander effect; whereas ATM, ERK, MAPK, P53, ROS, TNFα-related signal transduction pathways are involved in LDIR-induced genomic instability. These results suggest that different manifestations of LDIR-induced cellular responses may have different signal transduction pathways. On the other hand, LDIR-induced different responses may also share the same signal transduction pathways. For instance, P53 has been involved in LDIR-induced hormesis, adaptive response, radioresistance and genomic instability. Current data therefore suggest that caution should be taken when designing therapeutic approaches using LDIR to induce beneficial effects in humans.
25812964	Slug mediates nasopharyngeal carcinoma radioresistance via downregulation of PUMA in a p53-dependent and -independent manner.	Xu T, Fan B, Lv C, Xiao D.	Slug is involved in the radioresistance and chemoresistance of several types of cancers. In the present study, we first studied the effect of Slug on the radioresistance of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). We established radioresistant CNE-2 cells (CNE-2-RES) by exposing CNE-2 cells to gradually increasing doses of irradiation (IR). We used lentiviral infection technique to stably knock down Slug and then studied the effects in vitro and in vivo. Western blotting and RT-PCR were applied to detect the protein and mRNA expression in NPC cells or xenograft tumor tissues, respectively. Colony forming assay was applied to detect the cell survival after IR. As a result, CNE-2-RES cells were successfully established, CNE-2-RES cells showed relatively higher expression of Slug, higher expression of p53 and lower expression of PUMA. Following inhibition of Slug, the radiosensitivity of NPC was enhanced both in vitro and in vivo. Slug inversely regulated PUMA and p53 expression in both CNE-2 and CNE-2-RES cells. Animal experiments showed the same trend of protein expression as the in vitro results. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that Slug overexpression in CNE-2-RES cells may result in the radioresistance of cells. Slug mediates CNE-2 radioresistance via downregulation of PUMA in both a p53-dependent and p53-independent manner.
25875800	MGMT inhibition suppresses survivin expression in pancreatic cancer.	Bobustuc GC, Patel A, Thompson M, Srivenugopal KS, Frick J, Weese J, Konduri SD.	OBJECTIVES: Survivin, an antiapoptotic gene inhibited by p53, is overexpressed in human cancers and correlates with chemotherapy resistance. Here, we investigated the mutual regulatory mechanism between MGMT (O-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase) and survivin. METHODS: This study used standard techniques for protein and messenger RNA levels, promoter activity, protein-DNA interaction, cell viability, and correlative animal model. RESULTS: O-benzylguanine (BG), a potent inhibitor of MGMT (a DNA repair protein), curtails the expression of survivin in pancreatic cancer. Silencing MGMT by small interfering RNA down-regulates survivin transcription. p53 inhibition enhances MGMT and survivin expressions. When p53 was silenced, BG-induced MGMT inhibition was not associated with the down-regulation of survivin, underscoring the regulatory role of p53 in the MGMT-survivin axis. O-benzylguanine inhibits survivin and PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) at messenger RNA and protein levels in PANC-1 and L3.6pl cells and decreases survivin promoter activity via increased p53 recruitment to the survivin promoter. In orthotopic pancreatic xenografts established in nude mice, BG ± gemcitabine (GEM) decrease survivin expression in tumor tissue; protein levels and immunohistochemistry show significant decrease in survivin and PCNA levels, which correlate with increased sensitivity to GEM. CONCLUSIONS: MGMT inhibition is associated with decrease in survivin expression and increase in sensitivity to GEM in pancreatic cancer.
25914192	Rational Design of Ruthenium Complexes Containing 2,6-Bis(benzimidazolyl)pyridine Derivatives with Radiosensitization Activity by Enhancing p53 Activation.	Deng Z, Yu L, Cao W, Zheng W, Chen T.	The rational design of metal-based complexes is an effective strategy for the discovery of potent sensitizers for use in cancer radiotherapy. In this study, we synthesized three ruthenium complexes containing bis-benzimidazole derivatives: Ru(bbp)Cl3 (1), [Ru(bbp)2 ]Cl2 (2 a) (in which bbp=2,6-bis(benzimidazol-1-yl)pyridine), and [Ru(bnbp)2 ]Cl2 (2 b) (where bnbp=2,6-bis-(6-nitrobenzimidazol-2-yl)pyridine). We evaluated their radiosensitization capacities in vitro and mechanisms of action. Complex 2 b was found to be particularly effective in sensitizing human melanoma A375 cells toward radiation, with a sensitivity enhancement ratio of 2.4. Along with this potency, complex 2 b exhibited a high degree of selectivity between human cancer and normal cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that 2 b promotes radiation-induced accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) by reacting with cellular glutathione (GSH) and then causing DNA stand breaks. The subsequent DNA damage induces phosphorylation of p53 (p-p53) and upregulates the expression levels of p21, which inhibits the expression of cyclin-B, leading to G2M arrest. Moreover, p-p53 activates caspases-3 and -8, triggers cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), finally resulting in apoptosis. Taken together, the results of this study provide a strategy for the design of ruthenium-based radiosensitizers for use in cancer therapy.
25915849	Mdm2 overexpression and p73 loss exacerbate genomic instability and dampen apoptosis, resulting in B-cell lymphoma.	Riley MF, You MJ, Multani AS, Lozano G.	Many human tumors express high levels of the p53 inhibitor Mdm2, resulting from amplification of the Mdm2 locus or aberrant post-translational regulation of the Mdm2 protein. While the importance of Mdm2 in regulating p53 is clear, Mdm2 also has p53-independent roles. For example, overexpression of Mdm2 results in genomic instability in a p53-independent manner. In addition, Mdm2 has many additional binding partners, some of which, such as the tumor suppressor p73, have also been implicated in genomic instability. In this study, cells and tumors with Mdm2 overexpression and p73 loss exhibit increased genomic instability as compared with either alteration alone and cooperate in development of B-cell lymphomagenesis. Cytogenetic analysis of mouse embryonic fibroblasts and pre-malignant B cells demonstrates that loss of p73 exacerbates the chromosome breaks and fusions observed in Mdm2(Tg) cells. B-cell lymphomas from Mdm2(Tg);p73(+/-) mice retain the remaining p73 allele, exhibit elevated levels of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl2 and thus dampen apoptosis. In summary, Mdm2 overexpression and p73 loss cooperate in genomic instability and tumor development, indicating that the oncogenic function of Mdm2 is a combined effect of inhibiting p53 and p73 functions. Given that p73 is lost or silenced in human B-cell lymphomas, the Mdm2(Tg);p73(+/-) mouse serves as a model for human disease and may provide additional insight into the pathways that contribute to B-cell lymphomagenesis.Oncogene advance online publication, 27 April 2015; doi:10.1038/onc.2015.88.
25920253	Ovarian cancer HO-8910 cell apoptosis induced by crocin in vitro.	Xia D.	The effect and mechanism of ovarian cancer HO-8910 cell apoptosis induced by crocin.MTT assay was performed to detect the inhibitory action of crocin on the proliferation of HO-8910 cells. Flow cytometry was used to test the cell cycle distribution and apoptosis rate of ovarian cancer HO-8910 cells. Western blot analysis was utilized to measure the levels of apoptotic proteins such as p53, Fas/APO-1, and Caspase-3. MTT analysis revealed that crocin significantly inhibited the growth of HO-8910 cells. Additionally, flow cytometry illustrated that crocin raised the proportion of HO-8910 cells in the G0/G1 phase and increased their apoptosis rate. Furthermore, Western blot analysis revealed that crocin up-regulated the expression of p53, Fas/APO-1, and Caspase-3. The results of this study showed that crocin can significantly inhibit the growth of HO-8910 cells and arrest them in the G0/G1 phase. Crocin can also promote ovarian cancer HO-8910 cell apoptosis, most likely by increasing p53 and Fas/APO-1 expression, and then activating the apoptotic pathway regulated by Caspase-3.
25987034	Identification of High Affinity Non-Peptidic Small Molecule Inhibitors of MDM2-p53 Interactions through Structure-Based Virtual Screening Strategies.	Bandaru S, Ponnala D, Lakkaraju C, Bhukya CK, Shaheen U, Nayarisseri A.	BACKGROUND: Approaches in disruption of MDM2-p53 interactions have now emerged as an important therapeutic strategy in resurrecting wild type p53 functional status. The present study highlights virtual screening strategies in identification of high affinity small molecule non-peptidic inhibitors. Nutlin3A and RG7112 belonging to compound class of Cis-imidazoline, MI219 of Spiro-oxindole class and Benzodiazepine derived TDP 665759 served as query small molecules for similarity search with a threshold of 95%. The query molecules and the similar molecules corresponding to each query were docked at the transactivation binding cleft of MDM2 protein. Aided by MolDock algorithm, high affinity compound against MDM2 was retrieved. Patch Dock supervised Protein-Protein interactions were established between MDM2 and ligand (query and similar) bound and free states of p53. Compounds with PubCid 68870345, 77819398, 71132874, and 11952782 respectively structurally similar to Nutlin3A, RG7112, Mi219 and TDP 665759 demonstrated higher affinity to MDM2 in comparison to their parent compounds. Evident from the protein-protein interaction studies, all the similar compounds except for 77819398 (similar to RG 7112) showed appreciable inhibitory potential. Of particular relevance, compound 68870345 akin to Nutlin 3A had highest inhibitory potential that respectively showed 1.3, 1.2, 1.16 and 1.26 folds higher inhibitory potential than Nutilin 3A, MI 219, RG 7112 and TDP 1665759. Compound 68870345 was further mapped for structure based pharamacophoric features. In the study, we report Cis-imidazoline derivative compound; Pubcid: 68870345 to have highest inhibitory potential in blocking MDM2-p53 interactions hitherto discovered.
26044732	Inhibitor of p53-p21 pathway induces the differentiation of human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells into cardiomyogenic cells.	Ruan ZB, Zhu L, Yin YG, Chen GC.	P53 is shown recently to play an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. In this study, human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) were isolated and purified from the umbilical cords of normal or cesarean term deliveries, after treatment with 20 μmol/L PFT-α for 24 h, hUCMSCs were continued to be cultured for 4 weeks, cardiac-specific protein expression of cTnI, Desmin and Nkx2.5 was determined using immunofluorescence assay and RT-PCR. The expression of p53 and p21 was detected by western blot. Results showed that no expression of cTnI, Desmin or Nkx2.5 was observed in the control and the PFT-α group at 1 week after induction. However, after 4 weeks, while control group still had little expression of cTnI, Desmin and Nkx2.5, the PFT-α group demonstrated strong expression of cTnI, Desmin and Nkx2.5 (P < 0.001). At 4 weeks after induction, differentiation rate of cardiomyogenic cells in the PFT-α group (36.98 %) was significantly higher than that in the control group (4.41 %) (P < 0.01). Western blot analysis show that downregulation of p53 and p21 was seen in the PFT-α group at 4 weeks. The difference compared with the control group was statistically significant (P < 0.01). In conclusion, PFT-α can promote the differentiation of hUCMSCs into cardiomyogenic cells by modulating the p53-p21 pathway.
26063033	Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology in pancreaticobiliary carcinomas: diagnostic efficacy of cell-block immunocytochemistry.	Ieni A, Todaro P, Crino SF, Barresi V, Tuccari G.	BACKGROUND: Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology was demonstrated to be a useful tool for the diagnosis and staging of pancreaticobiliary neoplastic lesions. Nonetheless, the diagnostic value of this procedure may be limited by low cellularity of the specimen, contamination of intestinal cells and unfeasibility of ancillary immunocytochemical procedures. The present study was to evaluate its usefulness in the diagnosis of neoplastic lesions. METHODS: A series of 46 pancreaticobiliary carcinomas with available cell block preparations was submitted to immunocytochemistry against cytokeratins, carcinoembryonic antigen, E-cadherin, CD10 and p53. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the cytological smear in the discrimination of malignant lesions were calculated and compared with those of cell block preparation with the immunocytochemical stains against p53 and CD10. RESULTS: According to our findings, the use of cell block preparations together with immunostains against p53 and CD10 allowed to discriminate malignant versus benign specimens with higher sensitivity than the only cytological examination. In detail, CD10 immunostaining was of significant help for the discrimination between cytological contaminants, such as benign gastrointestinal cells, and the neoplastic elements of pancreaticobiliary well differentiated adenocarcinomas. Also, intense nuclear immunoreactivity for p53 was encountered in about 2/3 of the cases and identified pancreatic malignancy with high sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that immunocytochemistry against both CD10 and p53 could be applied case by case, mainly to differentiate gastrointestinal and pancreatic benign cellular contaminants showing hyperplasia or reactive changes from differentiated pancreaticobiliary adenocarcinomas.
25404359	Granzyme B-activated p53 interacts with Bcl-2 to promote cytotoxic lymphocyte-mediated apoptosis.	Ben Safta T, Ziani L, Favre L, Lamendour L, Gros G, Mami-Chouaib F, Martinvalet D, Chouaib S, Thiery J.	Granzyme B (GzmB) plays a major role in CTLs and NK cell-mediated elimination of virus-infected cells and tumors. Human GzmB preferentially induces target cell apoptosis by cleaving the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bid, which, together with Bax, induces mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. We previously showed that GzmB also induces a rapid accumulation of the tumor-suppressor protein p53 within target cells, which seems to be involved in GzmB-induced apoptosis. In this article, we show that GzmB-activated p53 accumulates on target cell mitochondria and interacts with Bcl-2. This interaction prevents Bcl-2 inhibitory effect on both Bax and GzmB-truncated Bid, and promotes GzmB-induced mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. Consequently, blocking p53-Bcl-2 interaction decreases GzmB-induced Bax activation, cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and subsequent effector caspases activation leading to a decreased sensitivity of target cells to both GzmB and CTL/NK-mediated cell death. Together, our results define p53 as a new important player in the GzmB apoptotic signaling pathway and in CTL/NK-induced apoptosis.
25639717	CR389, a benzoimidazolyl pyridinone analog, induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via p53 activation in human ovarian cancer PA-1 cells.	Suh H, Choi KW, Lee CH.	In the course of screening for novel cell cycle inhibitors and apoptotic inducers, CR389, elucidated as 5-(1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyridin-2-one, was generated as a new hit compound. Flow cytometric analysis and western blots of PA-1 cells treated with 40 micrometer CR389 revealed an appreciable cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase through direct inhibition of the CDK1 complex. In addition, activation of p53 via phosphorylation at Ser15 and subsequent up-regulation of p21(CIP1) showed that CR389 also induces p53-dependent-p21(CIP1)-mediated cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, apoptotic induction in 40 micrometer CR389-treated PA-1 cells is associated with the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria through up-regulation of the proapoptotic Bax protein, which results in the activation of procaspase-9 and -3, and the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Accordingly, CR389 seems to have multiple mechanisms of antiproliferative activity through p53-mediated pathways against human ovarian cancer cells. Therefore, we conclude that CR389 is a candidate therapeutic agent for the treatment of human ovarian cancer via the activation of p53.
25772694	Meloxicam inhibits fipronil-induced apoptosis via modulation of the oxidative stress and inflammatory response in SH-SY5Y cells.	Park JH, Park YS, Lee JB, Park KH, Paik MK, Jeong M, Koh HC.	Oxidative stress and inflammatory responses have been identified as key elements of neuronal cell apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which inflammatory responses contribute to apoptosis in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells treated with fipronil (FPN). Based on the cytotoxic mechanism of FPN, we examined the neuroprotective effects of meloxicam against FPN-induced neuronal cell death. Treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with FPN induced apoptosis via activation of caspase-9 and -3, leading to nuclear condensation. In addition, FPN induced oxidative stress and increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) via inflammatory stimulation. Pretreatment of cells with meloxicam enhanced the viability of FPN-exposed cells through attenuation of oxidative stress and inflammatory response. FPN activated mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and inhibitors of MAPK abolished FPN-induced COX-2 expression. Meloxicam also attenuated FPN-induced cell death by reducing MAPK-mediated pro-inflammatory factors. Furthermore, we observed both nuclear accumulation of p53 and enhanced levels of cytosolic p53 in a concentration-dependent manner after FPN treatment. Pretreatment of cells with meloxicam blocked the translocation of p53 from the cytosol to the nucleus. Together, these data suggest that meloxicam may exert anti-apoptotic effects against FPN-induced cytotoxicity by both attenuating oxidative stress and inhibiting the inflammatory cascade via inactivation of MAPK and p53 signaling.

25394497	Flavonoids in Ginkgo biloba fallen leaves induce apoptosis through modulation of p53 activation in melanoma cells.	Park HJ, Kim MM.	The aim of the present study was to examine the apoptotic effect of flavonoids in methanol extracts of Ginkgo biloba fallen leaves (MEGFL) on melanoma cells. Ginkgo biloba is a deciduous castle chaplain and its leaves include various types of flavonoids such as flavonol-O-glycosides. Ginkgo biloba is known to have therapeutic properties against a number of diseases such as cerebrovascular diseases, blood circulation disease and hypertension. In the present study MEGFL exhibited a higher cytotoxic effect on melanoma cells than Ginkgo biloba leaves (MEGL). It was also found that MEGFL induced apoptotic cell death which was characterized by DNA fragmentation. During the cell death process following treatment with MEGFL, the expression of a variety of death-associated proteins including p53, caspase-3, caspase-9, cytochrome c and Bax were analyzed in the cytosol of melanoma cells. MEGFL significantly increased the expression levels of caspase-3, caspase-9 and p53 in a dose-dependent manner. Our results indicate that MEGFL induced apoptotic cell death by increasing the expression of cell death-associated proteins in melanoma cells.
26214777	Role of Δ133p53 in Tumor Necrosis Factor-induced survival of p53 functions in MKN45 gastric cancer cell line.	Shang ZM, Tang JD, Jiang QQ, Guo A, Zhang N, Gao ZX, Ji WS.	OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of Δ133p53 in the effect of recombinant mutant human Tumor Necrosis Factor (rmhTNF) on two gastric cancer cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MKN45 (with Δ133p53 expression) or SGC7901 (without Δ133p53 expression) cells were treated with rmhTNF of different concentrations only or combined with fluorouracil (5-FU), and the growth inhibition rate was detected by a cell counting kit, and apoptosis by flow cytometry. The mRNA of Δ133p53, p53, Gadd45α, MDM2, PTEN and Bax was measured by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) or Nested PCR (nPCR). RESULTS: On Δ133p53-positive MKN-45 cells, the effect of rmhTNF was significant in growth inhibition test (t = -9.558, p < 0.01); also, the effect of 5-FU was improved by rmhTNF with remarkable time- and dose-effect (F = 82.742, p < 0.01; F = 128.583, p < 0.01). However, on Δ133p53-negative SGC-7901 cells, no growth inhibition was showed by rmhTNF only (t = -0.121, p > 0.05). In apoptosis test, the effect of rmhTNF was significant on MKN45 cells, and the effect of 5-FU was improved significantly by rmhTNF (F = 123.931, p < 0.05). In mRNA measurement, rmhTNF-induced up-regulation of p53 accompanied with down-regulation of Δ133p53, which correlated significantly to the change of p53 downstream molecules, including MDM2, PTEN, Gadd45α, and Bax. CONCLUSIONS: The results in these experiments suggested that Δ133p53 play a pivotal role in rmhTNF-induced survival of p53 functions in Δ133p53-positive MKN-45 cells.
26418905	Correlation Between RAB27B and p53 Expression and Overall Survival in Pancreatic Cancer.	Zhao H, Wang Q, Wang X, Zhu H, Zhang S, Wang W, Wang Z, Huang J.	OBJECTIVES: RAB27B is a member of the Rab family GTPases involved in vesicle trafficking, and p53 has recently been implicated in regulating the exosome secretion pathway. Because exosome secretion plays an important role in modulating tumor microenvironment and invasive growth, we hypothesized that RAB27B and p53 expression might be associated with the aggressive behavior in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, one of the most deadly human malignancies. METHODS: We determined protein expression of RAB27B and p53 in 260 pancreatic tissues (186 malignant and 74 normal or benign) by immunohistochemistry analysis on tissue microarray and their correlation with patients' clinical parameters and overall survival. RESULTS: We found that a high RAB27B protein expression (RAB27B) was significantly associated with perineural and vascular invasion, as well as distant metastasis. Patients with a high RAB27B expression had significantly poorer overall survival in both univariate and multivariate analyses. A significant correlation between RAB27B and p53 expression was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that RAB27B expression is an independent prognostic marker for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and suggest that RAB27B-regulated exosome secretion pathway represents a novel therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

26312422	Correlation between radiation dose and p53 protein expression levels in human lymphocytes.	Cavalcanti MB, Fernandes TS, Silva EB, Amaral A.	The aim of this research was to evaluate the relationship between p53 protein levels and absorbed doses from in vitro irradiated human lymphocytes. For this, samples of blood from 23 donors were irradiated with 0.5; 1; 2; and 4 Gy from a Cobalt-60 source, and the percentages of lymphocytes expressing p53 were scored using Flow Cytometry. The subjects were divided into 3 groups, in accordance with the p53 levels expressed per radiation dose: low (Group I), high (Group II), and excessive levels (Group III). For all groups, the analyses showed that the p53 expression levels increase with the absorbed dose. Particularly for groups I and II, the correlation between this protein expression and the dose follows the linear-quadratic model, such as for radioinduced chromosomal aberrations. In conclusion, our findings indicate possible applications of this approach in evaluating individual radiosensitivity prior to radiotherapeutical procedures as well as in medical surveillance of occupationally exposed workers. Furthermore, due to the rapidity of flow-cytometric analyses, the methodology here employed would play an important role in emergency responses to a large-scale radiation incident where many people may have been exposed.
25605253	Selective inhibition of histone deacetylase 2 induces p53-dependent survivin downregulation through MDM2 proteasomal degradation.	Seo SK, Hwang CS, Choe TB, Hong SI, Yi JY, Hwang SG, Lee HG, Oh ST, Lee YH, Park IC.	In the present study, we found that selective inhibition of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) with small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) induced survivin downregulation in a p53-dependent manner. Interestingly, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) or knockdown of HDAC2 induced downregulation of Mdm2, a negative regulator of p53, at the protein level. SAHA and/or HDAC2 siRNA increased Mdm2 ubiquitination, and MG132, an inhibitor of proteosome function, prevented HDAC2 inhibition-induced degradation of Mdm2. Clinically, the mRNA levels of HDAC2 and survivin were prominently overexpressed in lung cancer patients compared to normal lung tissues. Silencing of HDAC2 enhanced the cell death caused by ionizing radiation in lung cancer cells. Collectively, our results indicate that selective inhibition of HDAC2 causes survivin downregulation through activation of p53, which is mediated by downregulation of Mdm2. They further suggest that HDAC2 may exert a dominant effect on lung cancer cell survival by sustaining Mdm2-survivin levels.
25749379	Enzastaurin inhibits ABCB1-mediated drug efflux independently of effects on protein kinase C signalling and the cellular p53 status.	Michaelis M, Rothweiler F, Löschmann N, Sharifi M, Ghafourian T, Cinatl J Jr.	The PKCβ inhibitor enzastaurin was tested in parental neuroblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines, their vincristine-resistant sub-lines, primary neuroblastoma cells, ABCB1-transduced, ABCG2-transduced, and p53-depleted cells. Enzastaurin IC50s ranged from 3.3 to 9.5 μM in cell lines and primary cells independently of the ABCB1, ABCG2, or p53 status. Enzastaurin 0.3125 μM interfered with ABCB1-mediated drug transport. PKCα and PKCβ may phosphorylate and activate ABCB1 under the control of p53. However, enzastaurin exerted similar effects on ABCB1 in the presence or absence of functional p53. Also, enzastaurin inhibited PKC signalling only in concentrations ≥ 1.25 μM. The investigated cell lines did not express PKCβ. PKCα depletion reduced PKC signalling but did not affect ABCB1 activity. Intracellular levels of the fluorescent ABCB1 substrate rhodamine 123 rapidly decreased after wash-out of extracellular enzastaurin, and enzastaurin induced ABCB1 ATPase activity resembling the ABCB1 substrate verapamil. Computational docking experiments detected a direct interaction of enzastaurin and ABCB1. These data suggest that enzastaurin directly interferes with ABCB1 function. Enzastaurin further inhibited ABCG2-mediated drug transport but by a different mechanism since it reduced ABCG2 ATPase activity. These findings are important for the further development of therapies combining enzastaurin with ABC transporter substrates.
26363315	Repositioning antipsychotic chlorpromazine for treating colorectal cancer by inhibiting sirtuin 1.	Lee WY, Lee WT, Cheng CH, Chen KC, Chou CM, Chung CH, Sun MS, Cheng HW, Ho MN, Lin CW.	Investigating existing drugs for repositioning can enable overcoming bottlenecks in the drug development process. Here, we investigated the effect and molecular mechanism of the antipsychotic drug chlorpromazine (CPZ) and identified its potential for treating colorectal cancer (CRC). Human CRC cell lines harboring different p53 statuses were used to investigate the inhibitory mechanism of CPZ. CPZ effectively inhibited tumor growth and induced apoptosis in CRC cells in a p53-dependent manner. Activation of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was crucial for CPZ-induced p53 expression and the subsequent induction of tumor apoptosis. Induction of p53 acetylation at lysine382 was involved in CPZ-mediated tumor apoptosis, and this induction was attenuated by sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a class III histone deacetylase. By contrast, knocking down SIRT1 sensitized tumor cells to CPZ treatment. Moreover, CPZ induced the degradation of SIRT1 protein participating downstream of JNK, and JNK suppression abrogated CPZ-mediated SIRT1 downregulation. Clinical analysis revealed a significant association between high SIRT1 expression and poor outcome in CRC patients. These data suggest that SIRT1 is an attractive therapeutic target for CRC and that CPZ is a potential repositioned drug for treating CRC.
25948499	Aphidicolin inhibits cell proliferation via the p53-GADD45β pathway in AtT-20 cells.	Kageyama K, Sugiyama A, Murasawa S, Asari Y, Niioka K, Oki Y, Daimon M.	Cushing's disease is primarily caused by pituitary corticotroph adenomas, which autonomically secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH production may be associated with tumor cell proliferation; however, the effects of cell cycle progression on ACTH production and cell proliferation are little known in corticotroph tumor cells. A DNA polymerase inhibitor, aphidicolin, arrests cells at the entrance to the S phase and blocks the cell cycle; aphidicolin also induces apoptosis in tumor cells. In the present study, we determined ACTH production and cell proliferation of AtT-20 corticotroph tumor cells following treatment with aphidicolin. Aphidicolin decreased proopiomelanocortin mRNA levels in AtT-20 cells and the levels of ACTH in the culture medium of these cells. Aphidicolin also decreased cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in AtT-20 cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses revealed that this agent increased the percentage of G0/G1 phase cells, and decreased S phase cells. Aphidicolin decreased the phosphorylation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein and Akt. Aphidicolin increased the levels of tumor protein 27 (p27) and 53 (p53), while it decreased cyclin E levels. Aphidicolin also increased the mRNA levels of the stress response gene growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45β (GADD45β), a putative downstream target of p53. The p53 knockdown increased GADD45β mRNA levels. The GADD45β knockdown inhibited the decreases in cell proliferation. Thus, aphidicolin inhibits cell proliferation via the p53-GADD45β pathway in AtT-20 cells.
26115576	Identification of a new p53/MDM2 inhibitor motif inspired by studies of chlorofusin.	Cominetti MM, Goffin SA, Raffel E, Turner KD, Ramoutar JC, O'Connell MA, Howell LA, Searcey M.	Previous studies on the natural product chlorofusin have shown that the full peptide and azaphilone structure are required for inhibition of the interaction between MDM2 and p53. In the current work, we utilized the cyclic peptide as a template and introduced an azidonorvaline amino acid in place of the ornithine/azaphilone of the natural product and carried out click chemistry with the resulting peptide. From this small library the first ever non-azaphilone containing chlorofusin analog with MDM2/p53 activity was identified. Further studies then suggested that the simple structure of the Fmoc-norvaline amino acid that had undergone a click reaction was also able to inhibit MDM2/p53 interaction. This is an example where studies of a natural product have led to the serendipitous identification of a new small molecule inhibitor of a protein-protein interaction.
26201457	Evidence for anti-apoptotic roles of proteasome activator 28γ via inhibiting caspase activity.	Moncsek A, Gruner M, Meyer H, Lehmann A, Kloetzel PM, Stohwasser R.	Proteasome activator PA28γ (REGγ, Ki antigen) has recently been demonstrated to display anti-apoptotic properties via enhancing Mdm2-p53 interaction, thereby facilitating ubiquitination and down-regulation of the tumor suppressor p53. In this study we demonstrate a correlation between cellular PA28γ levels and the sensitivity of cells towards apoptosis in different cellular contexts thereby confirming a role of proteasome activator PA28γ as an anti-apoptotic regulator. We investigated the anti-apoptotic role of PA28γ upon UV-C stimulation in B8 mouse fibroblasts stably overexpressing the PA28γ-encoding PSME3 gene and upon butyrate-induced apoptosis in human HT29 adenocarcinoma cells with silenced PSME3 gene. Interestingly, our results demonstrate that PA28γ has a strong influence on different apoptotic hallmarks, especially p53 phosphorylation and caspase activation. In detail, PA28γ and effector caspases mutually restrict each other. PA28γ is a caspase substrate, if PA28γ levels are low. In contrast, PA28γ overexpression reduces caspase activities, including the caspase-dependent processing of PA28γ. Furthermore, overexpression of PA28γ resulted in a nuclear accumulation of transcriptional active p53. In summary, our findings indicate that even in a p53-dominated cellular context, pro-apoptotic signaling might be overcome by PA28γ-mediated caspase inhibition.
25640527	Cisplatin-induced renal toxicity via tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin 6, tumor suppressor P53, DNA damage, xanthine oxidase, histological changes, oxidative stress and nitric oxide in rats: protective effect of ginseng.	Yousef MI, Hussien HM.	Cisplatin is an effective chemotherapeutic agent successfully used in the treatment of a wide range of solid tumors, while its usage is limited due to its nephrotoxicity. The present study was undertaken to examine the effectiveness of ginseng to ameliorate the renal nephrotoxicity, damage in kidney genomic DNA, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin 6, tumor suppressor P53, histological changes and oxidative stress induced by cisplatin in rats. Cisplatin caused renal damage, including DNA fragmentation, upregulates gene expression of tumor suppressor protein p53 and tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-6. Cisplatin increased the levels of kidney TBARS, xanthine oxidase, nitric oxide, serum urea and creatinine. Cisplatin decreased the activities of antioxidant enzymes (GST, GPX, CAT and SOD), ATPase and the levels of GSH. A microscopic examination showed that cisplatin caused kidney damage including vacuolization, severe necrosis and degenerative changes. Ginseng co-treatment with cisplatin reduced its renal damage, oxidative stress, DNA fragmentation and induced DNA repair processes. Also, ginseng diminished p53 activation and improved renal cell apoptosis and nephrotoxicity. It can be concluded that, the protective effects of ginseng against cisplatin induced-renal damage was associated with the attenuation of oxidative stress and the preservation of antioxidant enzymes.
26490992	Curcumin induces apoptosis in p53-null Hep3B cells through a TAp73/DNp73-dependent pathway.	Wang J, Xie H, Gao F, Zhao T, Yang H, Kang B.	Curcumin has anticancer functions in various tumors. It has been shown to induce apoptosis through p53-dependent pathways. p73 gene is a member of the p53 family which encodes both a tumor suppressor (transactivation-competent p73 (TAp73)) and a putative oncogene (dominant-negative p73 (DNp73)); the former shares similarity with the tumor suppressor p53, and the latter behaves as dominant-negative proteins that interfere with the activity of TAp73. To understand the p73-dependent mechanisms that are engaged during curcumin-induced apoptosis, we established a p73 overexpression cell models using p53-deficient Hep3B cells (Hep3B(TAp73/DNp73)). Our results demonstrated that curcumin at concentrations of 40 and 80 μM induced DNA damage, increased TAp73/DNp73 ratio, and also led to apoptosis in the Hep3B(TAp73/DNp73) cells. The apoptotic cell death was concurrent with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential; release of cytochrome c from mitochondria; and the cleavage of caspase 9, caspase 3, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). These results demonstrated a p73-dependent mechanism for curcumin-induced apoptosis that involves the mitochondria-mediated pathway.
25424361	PRMT5 enhances generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from dairy goat embryonic fibroblasts via down-regulation of p53.	Chu Z, Niu B, Zhu H, He X, Bai C, Li G, Hua J.	OBJECTIVES: Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), is thought to play a role in epigenetic reprogramming of mouse germ cells. However, up to now there has been little information concerning its expression profile and effects on generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from somatic cells, in livestock. Here, we have explored PRMT5 expression profiles in dairy goats and its consequences to derivation of iPSCs from dairy goat embryonic fibroblasts (GEFs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated effects of PRMT5 on iPS-like cells production in vitro. alkaline phosphatase (AP) staining, QRT-PCR and western blotting analysis of expression of related markers were used to evaluate efficiency of generation of iPSCs derived from GEFs. RESULTS: These showed PRMT5 to be a conservative gene widely expressed in various tissues and different-aged testes. PRMT5 overexpression in combination with OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4 and C-MYC (POSKM) significantly increased number of AP positive iPS-like colony-derived GEFs compared to OSKM alone, in our dairy goats. Moreover, our results demonstrated that PRMT5 overexpression stimulated GEF proliferation and down-regulated p53, p21 (a target gene of p53) and the apoptotic marker caspase 3, to enhance somatic cell reprogramming. CONCLUSION: This study provides an efficient model for future studies on mechanisms underlying goat somatic cell reprogramming and differentiation.
25762091	p53 target gene Rap2B regulates the cytoskeleton and inhibits cell spreading.	Di J, Huang H, Wang Y, Qu D, Tang J, Cheng Q, Lu Z, Zhang Y, Zheng J.	Cell migration requires spatiotemporal integration of signals that target cytoskeletal. Previous studies have indicated that Rho GTPases are crucial regulators of actin dynamics. As homologs of Rho proteins, the role of Rap2B in the regulation of cytoskeleton and its cell signaling pathway remains unknown.The cellular functions of Rap2B were monitored by Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining in order to characterize the protein level and the cell shape.Here, we show that expression of Rap2B was induced by nocodazole in a p53-dependent manner. However, Rap2B itself is not necessary for p53-dependent cell cycle arrest. We evidenced that over-expression of Rap2B may inhibit cell spreading by disrupting actin dynamics upon nocodazole treatment, but Rap2B (C180A) mutant does not. In contrast, knockdown of Rap2B promoted cell spreading.Altogether, these results revealed that Rap2B plays a pivotal role in cytoskeleton reorganization and subsequently inhibits cell spreading, which could be responsible for cancer metastasis.
26505272	Low-Dose Actinomycin-D Induces Redistribution of Wild-Type and Mutated Nucleophosmin Followed by Cell Death in Leukemic Cells.	Brodská B, Holoubek A, Otevřelová P, Kuželová K.	Specific mutations involving C-terminal part of the nucleolar protein nucleophosmin (NPM) are associated with better outcome of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapy, possibly due to aberrant cytoplasmic NPM localization facilitating induction of anti-NPM immune response. Actinomycin D (actD) is known to induce nucleolar stress leading to redistribution of many nucleolar proteins, including NPM. We analyzed the distribution of both wild-type and mutated NPM (NPMmut) in human cell lines, before and after low-dose actD treatment, in living cells expressing exogenous fluorescently labeled proteins as well as using immunofluorescence staining of endogenous proteins in fixed cells. The wild-type NPM form is prevalently nucleolar in intact cells and relocalizes mainly to the nucleoplasm following actD addition. The mutated NPM form is found both in the nucleoli and in the cytoplasm of untreated cells. ActD treatment leads to a marked increase in NPMmut amount in the nucleoplasm while a mild decrease is observed in the cytoplasm. Cell death was induced by low-dose actD in all the studied leukemic cell lines with different p53 and NPM status. In cells expressing the tumor suppresor p53 (CML-T1, OCI-AML3), cell cycle arrest in G1/G0 phase was followed by p53-dependent apoptosis while in p53-null HL60 cells, transient G2/M-phase arrest was followed by cell necrosis. We conclude that although actD does not increase NPM concentration in the cytoplasm, it could improve the effect of standard chemotherapy in leukemias through more general mechanisms.

26508747	Enhanced antigen detection in immunohistochemical staining using a 'digitized' chimeric antibody.	Eng HY, Wang CI, Xue Y, Lee CY, Binte Zulkifli S, Chiam PC, Ghadessy FJ, Lane DP.	The immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of mouse tissue sections using antibodies of mouse origin can result in high nonspecific background due to the staining of endogenous immunoglobulins (Igs) by enzyme-conjugated secondary antibodies. In order to obviate this issue, we developed a chimeric mouse-human anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (MH242) by grafting the variable regions of a known mouse antibody into a human Ig scaffold. This facilitated use of an anti-human secondary antibody, and resulted in near-zero background when compared with its parental mouse monoclonal antibody (PAb242). Furthermore, the chimeric antibody enabled reproducible detection of mutant p53 (homozygous R172H) expression in mouse tissue, an observation hitherto largely equivocal based on the use of existing antibodies. The approach we describe leads to the generation of tractable antibody reagents, whose integrity can be readily verified through DNA sequencing of expressor plasmids. The wide-spread adoption of such 'digitized' antibodies should reduce experimental disparities that can commonly arise through variations in antibody quality.
25556322	Correlation between SPARC (Osteonectin) expression with immunophenotypical and invasion characteristics of pituitary adenomas.	Onoz M, Basaran R, Gucluer B, Isik N, Kaner T, Sav A, Elmaci I.	Pituitary adenomas are the third most common intracranial tumors. Invasive adenomas account for only 0.1-0.2% of pituitary tumors. SPARC is a matrix glycoprotein that plays a role in progression and invasiveness of neoplasms. In this study, we examined the potential role of SPARC in invasive pituitary adenomas. Forty pituitary adenomas have been examined with histopathological and immunohistochemical techniques. The cohort has been classified into two groups as invasive (n = 25) and non-invasive (n = 15) utilizing the Hardy classification. Formalin fixed tissues have been stained with hematoxylin eosin. Ki-67, p53, and SPARC monoclonal antibodies have been used. We did not detect any significant difference on Ki-67, SPARC, and p53 expression patterns correlating with the pathological subtype or invasiveness. Only 24% of invasive adenomas had Ki-67 levels over 1%. A total of 67.7% non-invasive adenomas had Ki-67 levels below 1%. We did not detect any relation between SPARC levels and invasiveness of pituitary adenomas. Absence of significant SPARC expression in tumor progression, sellar dilatation, erosion and destruction suggest that SPARC scores are not related with invasiveness or progressiveness of pituitary adenomas.
25789401	Stranglehold on the spindle assembly checkpoint: the human papillomavirus E2 protein provokes BUBR1-dependent aneuploidy.	Tan CL, Teissier S, Gunaratne J, Quek LS, Bellanger S.	The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) E2 protein, which inhibits the E6 and E7 viral oncogenes, is believed to have anti-oncogenic properties. Here, we challenge this view and show that HPV-18 E2 over-activates the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) and induces DNA breaks in mitosis followed by aneuploidy. This phenotype is associated with interaction of E2 with the Mitotic Checkpoint Complex (MCC) proteins Cdc20, MAD2 and BUBR1. While BUBR1 silencing rescues the mitotic phenotype induced by E2, p53 silencing or presence of E6/E7 (inactivating p53 and increasing BUBR1 levels respectively) both amplify it. This work pinpoints E2 as a key protein in the initiation of HPV-induced cervical cancer and identifies the SAC as a target for oncogenic pathogens. Moreover, our results suggest a role of p53 in regulating the mitotic process itself and highlight SAC over-activation in a p53-negative context as a highly pathogenic event.
26473758	Structural investigations of the p53/p73 homologs from the tunicate species Ciona intestinalis reveal the sequence requirements for the formation of a tetramerization domain.	Heering J, Jonker HR, Löhr F, Schwalbe H, Dötsch V.	Most members of the p53 family of transcription factors form tetramers. Responsible for determining the oligomeric state is a short oligomerization domain consisting of one β-strand and one α-helix. With the exception of human p53 all other family members investigated so far contain a second α-helix as part of their tetramerization domain. Here we have used NMR spectroscopy to characterize the oligomerization domains of the two p53-like proteins from the tunicate Ciona intestinalis, representing the closest living relative of vertebrates. Structure determination reveals for one of the two proteins a new type of packing of this second α-helix on the core domain that was not predicted based on the sequence, while the other protein does not form a second helix despite the presence of crucial residues that are conserved in all other family members that form a second helix. By mutational analysis we identify a proline as well as large hydrophobic residues in the hinge region between both helices as the crucial determinant for the formation of a second helix.

25591593	Clinical significance of ERG rearrangement subtype and its association with increased p53 expression in Japanese and German prostate cancer.	Nishijima J, Hara T, Ikemoto K, Oga A, Kobayashi K, Kawai Y, Matsumoto H, Nagao K, Sasaki K, Gkoleizakis V, Fichtner J, Matsuyama H.	This study investigated differences in prevalence of the androgen-regulated transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and ETS transcription factor family member, v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog (ERG) fusion gene (TMPRSS2-ERG fusions) in clinically localized prostate cancer Japanese and German patients. A total of 105 specimens, including 69 Japanese and 36 German patients, were collected. The status of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and correlations of the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion with clinicopathological characteristics and immunohistochemistry were studied. Gene fusions were identified in 20% (14/69) of Japanese and 53% (19/36) of German patients (P < 0.001). The difference in the type of gene fusion between the two ethnic groups was statistically significant (P=0.024). Overexpression of ERG protein was significantly associated with gene fusion. Biochemical recurrence was significantly higher in patients with ERG overexpression than in those without, and not related to TMPRSS2-ERG fusion status. Interestingly, two types of gene fusions (deletion and increase of copy number) were significantly associated with increased p53 expression (P = 0.005). Association of specific gene fusions harboring higher genomic alterations with p53 expression levels suggests that p53 mutation might drive more aggressive arrangements of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in prostate cancer.ERG, p53, prostate cancer, TMPRSS2-ERG fusion.
25611575	Testicular hypofunction caused by activating p53 expression induced by reactive oxygen species in varicocele rats.	Liang M, Wen J, Dong Q, Zhao LG, Shi BK.	We investigated the mechanism of the testicular hypofunction induced by hypoxia in varicocele rats. Varicocele was induced by partial ligation of the left renal vein. Seven weeks later, left testis mass index was measured. The sperm counts and motility were tested by CASA. The change of seminiferous tubule tissue was observed by HE staining. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in left testicular tissue was measured by ELISA, and the expressions of HIF-1α and p53 were detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. The left testis mass index and the sperm motility were significantly lower in surgery group. By HE staining, the left seminiferous epithelial cell arrangement was incompact, disordered and vacuolated in surgery group. The ROS level in surgery group was significantly higher than the other groups. The results of immunohistochemistry and Western blot indicated that the expressions of HIF-1α and p53 increased significantly in surgery group. Our study demonstrated that varicocele caused hypoxia that could cause the rise of ROS level to induce the increase of p53 expression, leading to the decrease of testis mass index and changes of seminiferous tubules, which would reduce sperm motility and result in male infertility eventually.
25741593	LincRNA-p21 acts as a mediator of ING1b-induced apoptosis.	Tran UM, Rajarajacholan U, Soh J, Kim TS, Thalappilly S, Sensen CW, Riabowol K.	ING1b is a tumor suppressor that affects transcription, cell cycle control and apoptosis. ING1b is deregulated in disease, and its activity is closely linked to that of p53. In addition to regulating protein-coding genes, we found that ING1b also influences the expression of large intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs). In particular, lincRNA-p21 was significantly induced after DNA-damage stress or by ING1b overexpression. Furthermore, lincRNA-p21 expression in response to DNA damage was significantly attenuated in cells lacking ING1b. LincRNA-p21 is also a target of p53 and can trigger apoptosis in mouse cell models. We found that this function of lincRNA-p21 is conserved in human cell models. Moreover, ING1b and p53 could function independently to influence lincRNA-p21 expression. However, their effects become more additive under conditions of stress. In particular, ING1b regulates lincRNA-p21 levels by binding to its promoter and is required for induction of lincRNA-p21 by p53. The ability of ING1b to cause apoptosis is also impaired in the absence of lincRNA-p21. Surprisingly, deletion of the ING1b plant homeodomain, which allows it to bind histones and regulate chromatin structure, did not alter regulation of lincRNA-p21. Our findings suggest that ING1b induces lincRNA-p21 expression independently of histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation mark recognition and that lincRNA-p21 functions downstream of ING1b. Thus, regulation at the level of lincRNA-p21 may represent the point at which ING1b and p53 pathways converge to induce apoptosis under specific stress conditions.
26531836	A positive feedback loop of p53/miR-19/TP53INP1 modulates pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis.	Wang X, Wang L, Mo Q, Jia A, Dong Y, Wang G.	Pancreatic cancer is a common malignancy whose prognosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer is extremely poor, with only 20% of patients reaching two years of survival. Previous findings have shown that the tumor suppressor p53 is involved in the development of various types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer. Additionally, p53 is able to activate TP53INP1 transcription by regulating several phenotypes of cancer cells. Using gain and loss-of-function assays, the aim of the present study was to examine the relationships between miR-19a/b and cancer development as well as potential underlying mechanisms. The results showed that miR-19a/b identified a positive feedback regulation of p53/TP53INP1 axis. Additionally, p53 upregulated the TP53INP1 level in pancreatic cancer cells. However, overexpressed miR-19a/b partially restored the TP53 function in the pancreatic cancer cells while miR-19a/b downregulated TP53INP1 protein by directly targeting 3'UTR of its mRNA at the post-transcriptional level. In addition, the patient tissues identified that the miR-19a/b level in pancreatic cancer tissues was conversely correlated with TP53 and TP53INP1 expression. The results provide evidence for revealing the molecular mechanism involved in the development of pancreatic cancer and may be useful in the identification of new therapeutic targets for pancreatic cancer.
26439986	Estradiol induces apoptosis via activation of miRNA-23a and p53: implication for gender difference in liver cancer development.	Huang FY, Wong DK, Seto WK, Lai CL, Yuen MF.	Estrogen (E2) has been suggested to have a protective role in attenuating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. miRNAs have great potential as biomarkers and therapeutic agents owing to their ability to control gene expression. However, little is known about the mechanism underlying the protective role of E2 in hepatocarcinogenesis and the effects of E2 on apoptotic miRNAs expression. Using miRNA PCR array, we found more than 2-fold alteration was observed in 25 upregulated and 10 downregulated apoptotic miRNAs in E2-treated cells. Among these miRNAs, we found expression of miR-23a was related to p53 functional status in the male-derived liver cell-lines. We demonstrated that E2 via ERα transcriptionally activated miR-23a and p53 expression, and thus enhanced p53 activation of miR-23a expression. Moreover, miR-23a expression correlated inversely with the expression of target gene X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), but positively with the caspase-3/7 activity. Decreasing of XIAP might contribute to caspase-3 activity and cell apoptosis. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel E2-signaling mechanism in regulating miRNAs expression for controlling apoptosis in liver cells. Delineating the role of E2 in regulating the activation of p53 and miR-23a, expression in HCC is crucial to the understanding of the sex difference observed in HCC.
26460618	ILKAP, ILK and PINCH1 control cell survival of p53-wildtype glioblastoma cells after irradiation.	Hausmann C, Temme A, Cordes N, Eke I.	The prognosis is generally poor for patients suffering from glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) due to radiation and drug resistance. Prosurvival signaling originating from focal adhesion hubs essentially contributes to therapy resistance and tumor aggressiveness. As the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely elusive, we addressed whether targeting of the focal adhesion proteins particularly interesting new cysteine-histidine-rich 1 (PINCH1), integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and ILK associated phosphatase (ILKAP) modulates GBM cell radioresistance. Intriguingly, PINCH1, ILK and ILKAP depletion sensitized p53-wildtype, but not p53-mutant, GBM cells to radiotherapy. Concomitantly, these cells showed inactivated Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) and reduced proliferation. For PINCH1 and ILKAP knockdown, elevated levels of radiation-induced γH2AX/53BP1-positive foci, as a marker for DNA double strand breaks, were observed. Mechanistically, we identified radiation-induced phosphorylation of DNA protein kinase (DNAPK), an important DNA repair protein, to be dependent on ILKAP. This interaction was fundamental to radiation survival of p53-wildtype GBM cells. Conclusively, our data suggest an essential role of PINCH1, ILK and ILKAP for the radioresistance of p53-wildtype GBM cells and provide evidence for DNAPK functioning as a central mediator of ILKAP signaling. Strategies for targeting focal adhesion proteins in combination with radiotherapy might be a promising approach for patients with GBM.
25641429	Flavokawain B inhibits the growth of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells via p53 and caspase-dependent mechanisms.	Tang YL, Huang LB, Tian Y, Wang LN, Zhang XL, Ke ZY, Deng WG, Luo XQ.	The development of novel chemotherapeutic drugs is needed for the treatment of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In this study, the anti-leukemic effect and the potential molecular mechanisms of action of flavokawain B on ALL were investigated. Flavokawain B was found to significantly inhibit the cellular proliferation of B-ALL and T-ALL cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. It also induced cellular apoptosis by increasing the expression of p53, Bax and Puma, and activating the cleavage of caspase-3 and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP). Furthermore, the enhancement of p53-dependent apoptosis by flavokawain B could be rescued by pifithrin-α, a pharmacological inhibitor of p53 transcriptional activity. Moreover, the proliferation of leukemia blast cells from 16 patients with ALL was inhibited by flavokawain B, and tumor growth in xenograft mice was also suppressed by this drug. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of flavokawain B for the treatment of ALL.
25692307	Inauhzin(c) inactivates c-Myc independently of p53.	Jung JH, Liao JM, Zhang Q, Zeng S, Nguyen D, Hao Q, Zhou X, Cao B, Kim SH, Lu H.	Oncogene MYC is deregulated in many human cancers, especially in lymphoma. Previously, we showed that inauhzin (INZ) activates p53 and inhibits tumor growth. However, whether INZ could suppress cancer cell growth independently of p53 activity is still elusive. Here, we report that INZ(c), a second generation of INZ, suppresses c-Myc activity and thus inhibits growth of human lymphoma cells in a p53-independent manner. INZ(c) treatment decreased c-Myc expression at both mRNA and protein level, and suppressed c-Myc transcriptional activity in human Burkitt's lymphoma Raji cells with mutant p53. Also, we showed that overexpressing ectopic c-Myc rescues the inhibition of cell proliferation by INZ(c) in Raji cells, implicating c-Myc activity is targeted by INZ(c). Interestingly, the effect of INZ(c) on c-Myc expression was impaired by disrupting the targeting of c-Myc mRNA by miRNAs via knockdown of ribosomal protein (RP) L5, RPL11, or Ago2, a subunit of RISC complex, indicating that INZ(c) targets c-Myc via miRNA pathways. These results reveal a new mechanism that INZ
26542803	MicroRNA-7 Compromises p53-dependent Apoptosis by Controlling the Expression of the Chromatin Remodeling Factor SMARCD1.	Hong CF, Lin SY, Chou YT, Wu CW.	We previously demonstrated that EGFR upregulated miR-7 to promote tumor growth during lung cancer oncogenesis. Several lines of evidence have suggested that alterations in chromatin remodeling components contribute to cancer initiation and progression. In this study, we identified SMARCD1 (SWI/SNF related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily d, member 1) as a novel target gene of miR-7. miR-7 expression reduced SMARCD1 protein expression in lung cancer cell lines. We used luciferase reporters carrying wild type or mutated 3'UTR of SMARCD1, and found that miR-7 blocked SMARCD1 expression by binding to two seed regions in the 3'UTR of SMARCD1 and downregulated SMARCD1 mRNA expression. Additionally, upon chemotherapy drug treatment, miR-7 downregulated p53-dependent apoptosis-related gene BAX (BCL2-associated X protein) and p21 expression by interfering the interaction between SMARCD1 and p53, thereby reducing caspase3 cleavage and the downstream apoptosis cascades. We found that while SMARCD1 sensitized lung cancer cells to chemotherapy drug-induced apoptosis, miR-7 enhanced the drug resistance potential of lung cancer cells against chemotherapy drugs. SMARCD1 was downregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, and SMARCD1 and miR-7 expression levels were negatively correlated in clinical samples. Our investigation into the involvement of the EGFR-regulated miRNA pathway in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex suggest that EGFR-mediated miR-7 suppressed the coupling of the chromatin remodeling factor SMARCD1 with p53, resulting in increased chemo-resistance of lung cancer cells.
25168243	Cofactor Strap regulates oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial p53 activity through ATP synthase.	Maniam S, Coutts AS, Stratford MR, McGouran J, Kessler B, La Thangue NB.	Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer cells. Strap (stress-responsive activator of p300) is a novel TPR motif OB-fold protein that contributes to p53 transcriptional activation. We show here that, in addition to its established transcriptional role, Strap is localised at mitochondria where one of its key interaction partners is ATP synthase. Significantly, the interaction between Strap and ATP synthase downregulates mitochondrial ATP production. Under glucose-limiting conditions, cancer cells are sensitised by mitochondrial Strap to apoptosis, which is rescued by supplementing cells with an extracellular source of ATP. Furthermore, Strap augments the apoptotic effects of mitochondrial p53. These findings define Strap as a dual regulator of cellular reprogramming: first as a nuclear transcription cofactor and second in the direct regulation of mitochondrial respiration.
26150389	p53 protects against genome instability following centriole duplication failure.	Lambrus BG, Uetake Y, Clutario KM, Daggubati V, Snyder M, Sluder G, Holland AJ.	Centriole function has been difficult to study because of a lack of specific tools that allow persistent and reversible centriole depletion. Here we combined gene targeting with an auxin-inducible degradation system to achieve rapid, titratable, and reversible control of Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4), a master regulator of centriole biogenesis. Depletion of Plk4 led to a failure of centriole duplication that produced an irreversible cell cycle arrest within a few divisions. This arrest was not a result of a prolonged mitosis, chromosome segregation errors, or cytokinesis failure. Depleting p53 allowed cells that fail centriole duplication to proliferate indefinitely. Washout of auxin and restoration of endogenous Plk4 levels in cells that lack centrioles led to the penetrant formation of de novo centrioles that gained the ability to organize microtubules and duplicate. In summary, we uncover a p53-dependent surveillance mechanism that protects against genome instability by preventing cell growth after centriole duplication failure.
25721428	Dynamic p53 protein expression and phosphorylation in the kidneys of rats that experienced intrauterine growth restriction.	He X, Xie Z, Dong Q, Chen P, Li W, Wang T.	This study investigated the mechanisms involved in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).The IUGR model was established by feeding pregnant SD rats a low-protein diet. Protein expression and phosphorylation were detected using Western blot and/or immunohistochemistry. Cell apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining. The MDM2 mRNA expression was measured by real-time PCR.Pups from the IUGR group had significantly lower body (7th day, 2 months) and kidney weights (1st day, 7th day, 2 months) compared to pups from the control group (p < 0.01). The glomeruli number in IUGR pups was significantly less than that in the control pups at 2 and 3 months after birth (p < 0.01). p53 protein level and p53 phosphorylation at Ser(15) were time-dependently decreased in the kidney at 1st day, 7th day, 21st day, 2 months and 3 months, but their levels in the kidney of the IUGR pups was significantly higher than that in control pups at each time point (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, or p < 0.001). Significantly more positive p21 staining was observed in IUGR pups than in control pups at each time point. Real-time PCR of MDM2 mRNA expression showed no significant difference between IUGR and control pups (p > 0.05). Significant apoptosis was observed in the kidneys of IUGR pups compared to control pups.Malnutrition-induced IUGR may be associated with the activation of p53-p21 signaling in the kidney.
26578713	p53 regulates expression of uncoupling protein 1 through binding and repression of PPARγ coactivator 1α.	Hallenborg P, Fjære E, Liaset B, Petersen RK, Murano I, Sonne SB, Falkerslev M, Winther S, Jensen BA, Ma T, Hansen JB, Cinti S, Blagoev B, Madsen L, Kristiansen K.	The tumor suppressor p53 (TRP53 in mice) is known for its involvement in carcinogenesis, but work during recent years has underscored the importance of p53 in the regulation of whole body metabolism. A general notion is that p53 is necessary for efficient oxidative metabolism. The importance of UCP1-dependent uncoupled respiration and increased oxidation of glucose and fatty acids in brown or brown-like, termed BRITE or beige, adipocytes in relation to energy balance and homeostasis has recently been highlighted. UCP1-dependent uncoupled respiration in classic interscapular brown adipose tissue is central to cold-induced thermogenesis, whereas BRITE/beige adipocytes are of special importance in relation to diet-induced thermogenesis, where the importance of UCP1 is only clearly manifested in mice kept at thermoneutrality. We challenged wildtype and TRP53-deficient mice by high fat feeding under thermoneutral conditions. Interestingly, mice lacking TRP53 gained less weight compared to their wildtype counterparts. This was related to an increased expression of Ucp1 and other PPARGC1a and PPARGC1b target genes, but not Ppargc1a or Ppargc1b in inguinal white adipose tissue of mice lacking TRP53. We show that TRP53, independently of its ability to bind DNA, inhibits the activity of PPARGC1a and PPARGC1b. Collectively, our data shows that TRP53 has the ability to regulate the thermogenic capacity of adipocytes through modulation of PPARGC1 activity.
26573798	Hyperthermia Selectively Targets Human Papillomavirus in Cervical Tumors via p53-Dependent Apoptosis.	Oei AL, van Leeuwen CM, Ten Cate R, Rodermond HM, Buist MR, Stalpers LJ, Crezee J, Kok HP, Medema JP, Franken NA.	Human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with cervical cancer, the third most common cancer in women. The high-risk HPV types 16 and 18 are found in over 70% of cervical cancers and produce the oncoprotein, early protein 6 (E6), which binds to p53 and mediates its ubiquitination and degradation. Targeting E6 has been shown to be a promising treatment option to eliminate HPV-positive tumor cells. In addition, combined hyperthermia with radiation is a very effective treatment strategy for cervical cancer. In this study, we examined the effect of hyperthermia on HPV-positive cells using cervical cancer cell lines infected with HPV 16 and 18, in vivo tumor models, and ex vivo-treated patient biopsies. Strikingly, we demonstrate that a clinically relevant hyperthermia temperature of 42°C for 1 hour resulted in E6 degradation, thereby preventing the formation of the E6-p53 complex and enabling p53-dependent apoptosis and G2-phase arrest. Moreover, hyperthermia combined with p53 depletion restored both the cell-cycle distribution and apoptosis to control levels. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into the treatment of HPV-positive cervical cancer and suggest that hyperthermia therapy could improve patient outcomes.

26574916	Testosterone regulation of cyclin E kinase is a key factor determining gender differences in hepatocarcinogenesis.	Pok S, Barn VA, Wong HJ, Blackburn AC, Board P, Farrell GC, Teoh NC.	While gender differences in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are profound, the mechanism is unclear. Using castration and hormone replacement strategies, we tested whether these gender differences are attributable to testosterone or estradiol/progesterone (E/P) effects on cell cycle regulators and p53.We studied dysplastic liver and HCCs in intact and castrated diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-injected C57BL/6J male and female mice, with or without hormonal replacement. Effects of sex steroids on proliferation and survival of primary hepatocytes and primary HCC cells were also characterized.DEN-injected females displayed fewer dysplastic foci and slower onset of HCC than males, with smaller/more differentiated tumors and fewer metastases. Castration of DEN-injected males reduced cyclin E kinase and augmented hepatocyte apoptosis compared with intact males; E/P enhanced these effects. In intact females, cyclin E kinase activity was less than in males; testosterone administered to ovariectomized females up-regulated cyclin E, increased cyclin E kinase and accelerated hepatocarcinogenesis. In vitro, testosterone increased expression of cell cycle regulators (cyclin D1, cyclin E and cyclin-dependent kinase 2) and reduced p53 and p21, which enhanced hepatocyte viability. In contrast, estradiol both suppressed hepatocyte cell cycle markers, up-regulated p53 and reduced viability of hepatocytes and HCC cells.Testosterone is the positive regulator of hepatocyte cell cycle via cyclin E, while estradiol plays a negative role by effects of p53 and p21. Together, both sex hormones determine the male predominance of gender differences in hepatocarcinogenesis.
26575022	Nuclear localization of the caspase-3-cleaved form of p73 in anoikis.	Alsafadi S, Tourpin S, Bessoltane N, Salomé-Desnoulez S, Vassal G, André F, Ahomadegbe JC.	The transcription factor p73 is a homologue of p53 that can be expressed as pro- or anti-apoptotic isoforms. Unlike p53, p73 is rarely mutated or lost in cancers and it is found to replace defective p53 inducing apoptosis. Here, we investigated the p73 involvement in anoikis, a type of apoptosis caused by inadequate cell-matrix interactions. Breast cancer cell lines with different p53 status were treated with doxorubicin (DOX) or docetaxel (DOC) and cells detached from the extracellular matrix were analyzed. We demonstrate for the first time that DOX-induced cell detachment is associated with p73 cleavage and caspase activation, independently of the p53 status. However, we did not detect p73 cleavage or caspase activation in detached cells under DOC treatment. Overexpressing the apoptotic isoform of p73 led to cell detachment associated with p73 cleavage and caspase activation. Interestingly, p73 cleaved forms localize to the nucleus during the late phase of cell death indicating an increase in the transcriptional activity. Our study suggests that the cleavage of p73 on specific sites may release its pro-apoptotic function and contribute to cell death.
26580119	Roles of p53 and ASF1A in the Reprogramming of Sheep Kidney Cells to Pluripotent Cells.	Shi H, Fu Q, Li G, Ren Y, Hu S, Ni W, Guo F, Shi M, Meng L, Zhang H, Qiao J, Guo Z, Chen C.	Since the first report of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by Takahashi and Yamanaka, numerous attempts have been made to derive iPSCs from other species via the ectopic expression of defined factors. Sheep iPSCs (siPSCs) have significant potential for biotechnology and agriculture. Although several groups have described siPSCs, the reprogramming efficiency was extremely low. The exogenous transgenes could be not silenced in the iPSCs, which hampered their development and application. Here, we report that p53 knockdown and antisilencing function 1A (ASF1A) overexpression promoted iPSC generation from sheep kidney cells (SKCs). Compared with transduction with eight human defined transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc, Nanog, Lin28, hTERT, and SV40LT), the additional introduction of p53 RNA interference (RNAi) and/or ASF1A in the presence of small-molecule compounds [vitamin C (Vc) and valproic acid (VPA)] greatly improved the efficiency of sheep iPSC generation. The siPSCs exhibited morphological features similar to mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and were positive for alkaline phosphatase and, pluripotent marker genes (Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, Rex1, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, and E-cadherin). Furthermore, these cells exhibited a normal karyotype of 54 chromosomes and were able to differentiate into all three germ layers both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the exogenous genes were silenced in siPSCs when p53 small hairpin RNA (shRNA) and ASF1A were added. Our results may help to reveal the role of p53 and ASF1A in sheep somatic cell reprogramming and provide an efficient approach to reprogramming sheep somatic cells.
25658812	Quercetin regresses Dalton's lymphoma growth via suppression of PI3K/AKT signaling leading to upregulation of p53 and decrease in energy metabolism.	Maurya AK, Vinayak M.	Various oncogenes are associated with deregulation in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell survival, which ultimately cause cancerous growth. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) mediated signaling plays a key role in malignant transformation. Cell proliferation and cell survival of tumor cell are induced by hyper activation of PI3K, AKT1, glycolytic enzyme LDH-A, and inactivation of tumor suppressor gene p53. Dietary flavonoids such as quercetin are considered a powerful modulator of different cellular signaling pathways. The present study is focused on the role of quercetin on regulation of PI3K/AKT pathways in Dalton's lymphoma mice. Effect of quercetin was analyzed in ascite cells in terms of cell viability, glycolytic metabolism as well as expression, and level of PI3K (regulatory and catalytic subunit), AKT1, and p53 using standard methods. Results reflect hyperactivation of PI3K signaling in ascite cells of Dalton's lymphoma mice, leading to activation of AKT1 and inactivation of p53. Quercetin modulates the pathway toward suppression of lymphoma. Glycolytic metabolism was also downregulated by quercetin. Its tumor suppressor activity was confirmed by morphological parameters and longevity of mice. The findings suggest that quercetin may contribute to lymphoma prevention by downregulating PI3K-AKT1-p53 pathway as well as by glycolytic metabolism.
26593157	A Chemical Inhibitor of the Skp2/p300 Interaction that Promotes p53-Mediated Apoptosis.	Oh M, Lee JH, Moon H, Hyun YJ, Lim HS.	Skp2 is thought to have two critical roles in tumorigenesis. As part of the SCF(Skp2) ubiquitin ligase, Skp2 drives the cell cycle by mediating the degradation of cell cycle proteins. Besides the proteolytic activity, Skp2 also blocks p53-mediated apoptosis by outcompeting p53 for binding p300. Herein, we exploit the Skp2/p300 interaction as a new target for Skp2 inhibition. An affinity-based high-throughput screen of a combinatorial cyclic peptoid library identified an inhibitor that binds to Skp2 and interferes with the Skp2/p300 interaction. We show that antagonism of the Skp2/p300 interaction by the inhibitor leads to p300-mediated p53 acetylation, resulting in p53-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells, without affecting Skp2 proteolytic activity. Our results suggest that inhibition of the Skp2/p300 interaction has a great potential as a new anticancer strategy, and our Skp2 inhibitor can be developed as a chemical probe to delineate Skp2 non-proteolytic function in tumorigenesis.
26592508	Anticancer bioactive peptides suppress human colorectal tumor cell growth and induce apoptosis via modulating the PARP-p53-Mcl-1 signaling pathway.	Su LY, Shi YX, Yan MR, Xi Y, Su XL.	We have reported novel anticancer bioactive peptides (ACBPs) that show tumor-suppressive activities in human gastric cancer, leukemia, nasopharyngeal cancer, and gallbladder cancer. In this study, we investigated the effects of ACBPs on human colorectal cancer and the underlying mechanisms.Cell growth and apoptosis of human colorectal tumor cell line HCT116 were measured using cell proliferation assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The expression levels of PARP, p53 and Mcl1A were assessed with Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. For evaluation of the in vivo antitumor activity of ACBPs, HCT116 xenograft nude mice were treated with ACBPs (35 μg/mL, ip) for 10 days.Treatment of HCT116 cells with ACBPs (35 μg/mL) for 4-6 days significantly inhibited the cell growth. Furthermore, treatment of HCT116 cells with ACBPs (35 μg/mL) for 6-12 h significantly enhanced UV-induced apoptosis, increased the expression of PARP and p53, and decreased the expression of Mcl-1. Administration of ACBPs did not change the body weight of HCT116 xenograft nude mice, but decreased the tumor growth by approximately 43%, and increased the expression of PARP and p53, and decreased the expression of Mcl-1 in xenograft mouse tumor tissues.Administration of ACBPs inhibits human colorectal tumor cell growth and induces apoptosis in vitro and in vivo through modulating the PARP-p53-Mcl-1 signaling pathway.
26523514	Vaginal LPS changed gene transcriptional regulation response to ischemic reperfusion and increased vulnerability of fetal brain hemorrhage.	Dong Y, Kimura Y, Ito T, Velayo C, Sato T, Sugibayashi R, Funamoto K, Hitomi K, Iida K, Endo M, Sato N, Yaegashi N.	During pregnancy, both ischemic reperfusion and bacterial agent LPS are known risk factors for fetal brain damage. However, there is a lack of evidence to explain whether vaginal LPS affects the fetus response to ischemic reperfusion. Here we reported that there was more than 2 folds higher vulnerability of fetal brain hemorrhage response to ischemic reperfusion when mother mouse was treated with vaginal LPS. As our previously reported, ischemic reperfusion induces P53-dependent fetal brain damage was based on a molecular mechanism: the transcriptional pattern was changed from HIF-1alpha-dependent to P53-dependent immediately. In the present work, only with vaginal LPS precondition, phosphorylation of activated transcriptional factor (ATF) 2 at Thr71 appeared in response to ischemic reperfusion. Moreover, this phosphorylation was completely blocked by pre-treatment with a P53 inhibitor, pifithrin-α. We concluded that vaginal LPS precondition trigged the p53-dependent phosphorylation of ATF2 in response to ischemic reperfusion, which played an important role of increasing vulnerability to hemorrhage in fetus.
26069201	The clinical translational potential of p53-related alterations as cancer biomarkers.	Xiao M, Wang X, Chen W.	We aimed to analyse and summarise the potential value of the clinical use of p53-related alterations as cancer biomarkers. A systematic search and collection of the published meta-analyses on p53-related alterations and cancers in the past 5 years was conducted through appropriate queries in the PubMed database. We then composed "grey-scale" tables to show the significant levels for each variant, and the potential heterogeneity was subsequently discussed. The data show that p53-related alterations are extremely complex biomarkers in terms of their clinical translation. Together with the experimental studies on p53-related alterations, a gold-standard approach is still in need of development, with more evidence from clinical studies with large, prospectively planned cohorts, to fully understand its potential as a cancer biomarker.
26351212	Knockdown of Wip1 Enhances Sensitivity to Radiation in HeLa Cells Through Activation of p38 MAPK.	Wang HY, Liu ZS, Qiu L, Guo J, Li YF, Zhang J, Wang TJ, Liu XD.	The objectives of the study were to investigate the functional role and potential mechanism of wild-type p53-induced phosphatase (Wip1) in cervical cancer cell line HeLa cells, along with the effect of knockdown of Wip1 in combination with γ-irradiation on the HeLa cells. Expression of Wip1 was silenced or overexpressed. After transfection, cell viability was determined. Moreover, γ-irradiation and SB203580 were performed to explore the effect of colony formation and cell apoptosis. Likewise, protein expression levels of p38, p-p38, p53, and p-p53 were assessed in the presence or not of SB203580 and overexpression of Wip1. Both the mRNA and protein levels of Wip1 were significantly decreased by transfection with Wip1-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) but were significantly increased by transfection with pcDNA3.1-Wip1. Knockdown of Wip1 significantly decreased cell growth and colony formation ability and increased apoptotic rate. Additionally, better results were obtained by knockdown of Wip1 in combination with γ-irradiation. The protein expression levels of p-p38 (p < 0.05), p53 (p < 0.01), and p-p53 (p < 0.05) were all significantly increased by knockdown of Wip1. However, application of SB203580 reversed the effects. Our study confirms the important roles of Wip1 in cervical cancer. Knockdown of Wip1 enhances sensitivity to radiation in HeLa cells by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis through activation of p38 MAPK.
26598619	The Numb/p53 circuitry couples replicative self-renewal and tumor suppression in mammary epithelial cells.	Tosoni D, Zecchini S, Coazzoli M, Colaluca I, Mazzarol G, Rubio A, Caccia M, Villa E, Zilian O, Di Fiore PP, Pece S.	The cell fate determinant Numb orchestrates tissue morphogenesis and patterning in developmental systems. In the human mammary gland, Numb is a tumor suppressor and regulates p53 levels. However, whether this function is linked to its role in fate determination remains unclear. Here, by exploiting an ex vivo system, we show that at mitosis of purified mammary stem cells (SCs), Numb ensures the asymmetric outcome of self-renewing divisions by partitioning into the progeny that retains the SC identity, where it sustains high p53 activity. Numb also controls progenitor maturation. At this level, Numb loss associates with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and results in differentiation defects and reacquisition of stemness features. The mammary gland of Numb-knockout mice displays an expansion of the SC compartment, associated with morphological alterations and tumorigenicity in orthotopic transplants. This is because of low p53 levels and can be inhibited by restoration of Numb levels or p53 activity, which results in successful SC-targeted treatment.
26061048	p53 Represses the Oncogenic Sno-MiR-28 Derived from a SnoRNA.	Yu F, Bracken CP, Pillman KA, Lawrence DM, Goodall GJ, Callen DF, Neilsen PM.	p53 is a master tumour repressor that participates in vast regulatory networks, including feedback loops involving microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate p53 and that themselves are direct p53 transcriptional targets. We show here that a group of polycistronic miRNA-like non-coding RNAs derived from small nucleolar RNAs (sno-miRNAs) are transcriptionally repressed by p53 through their host gene, SNHG1. The most abundant of these, sno-miR-28, directly targets the p53-stabilizing gene, TAF9B. Collectively, p53, SNHG1, sno-miR-28 and TAF9B form a regulatory loop which affects p53 stability and downstream p53-regulated pathways. In addition, SNHG1, SNORD28 and sno-miR-28 are all significantly upregulated in breast tumours and the overexpression of sno-miR-28 promotes breast epithelial cell proliferation. This research has broadened our knowledge of the crosstalk between small non-coding RNA pathways and roles of sno-miRNAs in p53 regulation.
24963915	Hyperglycemia, p53, and mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis are involved in the susceptibility of diabetic models to ischemic acute kidney injury.	Peng J, Li X, Zhang D, Chen JK, Su Y, Smith SB, Dong Z.	Patients with chronic kidney diseases, including diabetic nephropathy, are more susceptible to acute kidney injury (AKI) and have a worse prognosis following AKI. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here we tested whether diabetic mice were more sensitive to AKI and show that renal ischemia-reperfusion induced significantly more severe AKI and higher mortality in the streptozotocin and Akita diabetic mouse models. The severity of AKI in the mice correlated with their blood glucose levels. In vitro, high glucose-conditioned renal proximal tubular cells showed higher apoptosis and caspase activation following ATP depletion and hypoxic injury, accompanied by a heightened mitochondrial accumulation of Bax and release of cytochrome c. In response to injury, both glucose-conditioned renal proximal tubular cells and diabetic kidney tissues showed markedly higher p53 induction. Suppression of p53 diminished the sensitivity of high glucose-conditioned cells to acute injury in vitro. Moreover, blockade of p53 by pifithrin-α, siRNA, or proximal tubule-targeted gene ablation reduced ischemic AKI in diabetic mice. Insulin reduced blood glucose in diabetic mice and largely attenuated their AKI sensitivity. Thus, our results suggest the involvement of hyperglycemia, p53, and the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis in the susceptibility of diabetic models to AKI.
25483559	Resveratrol inhibits β-amyloid-induced neuronal apoptosis via regulation of p53 acetylation in PC12 cells.	Ai Z, Li C, Li L, He G.	The natural product resveratrol possesses diverse biological activities, including anti‑inflammatory, anti‑oxidant, anti‑cancer and anti‑aging effects in multiple organisms. The neuroprotective role of resveratrol has recently been reported in a cell model of amyloid (A)β(25‑35)‑induced neurotoxic injury using PC12 cells. However, the pathomechanism by which resveratrol inhibits neuronal apoptosis has remained to be elucidated. The present study therefore aimed to confirm the neuroprotective effects of resveratrol in an Aβ(25‑35)‑induced model of neurotoxicity in PC12 cells and elucidate the mechanisms underlying these effects. It was demonstrated that resveratrol exerted neuronal protection through inhibition of cell apoptosis, which was associated with an increased acetylation level of p53. In accordance with this effect, when the acetylation level of p53 was decreased by p53 acetylation inhibitor pifithrin‑α, the protective effects of resveratrol were abrogated. In conclusion, it was revealed that resveratrol inhibited Aβ(25‑35)‑induced cell apoptosis via the acetylation of p53 in PC12 cells.
26121334	Inactivation of p53 Is Sufficient to Induce Development of Pulmonary Hypertension in Rats.	Jacquin S, Rincheval V, Mignotte B, Richard S, Humbert M, Mercier O, Londoño-Vallejo A, Fadel E, Eddahibi S.	OBJECTIVE: Pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PA-SMCs) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) show similarities to cancer cells. Due to the growth-suppressive and pro-apoptotic effects of p53 and its inactivation in cancer, we hypothesized that the p53 pathway could be altered in PAH. We therefore explored the involvement of p53 in the monocrotaline (MCT) rat model of pulmonary hypertension (PH) and the pathophysiological consequences of p53 inactivation in response to animal treatment with pifithrin-α (PFT, an inhibitor of p53 activity). METHODS AND RESULTS: PH development was assessed by pulmonary arterial pressure, right ventricular hypertrophy and arterial wall thickness. The effect of MCT and PFT on lung p53 pathway expression was evaluated by western blot. Fourteen days of daily PFT treatment (2.2 mg/kg/day), similar to a single injection of MCT (60 mg/kg), induced PH and aggravated MCT-induced PH. In the first week after MCT administration and prior to PH development, p53, p21 and MDM2 protein levels were significantly reduced; whereas PFT administration effectively altered the protein level of p53 targets. Anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative effects of PFT were revealed by TUNEL and MTT assays on cultured human PA-SMCs treated with 50 μM PFT. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological inactivation of p53 is sufficient to induce PH with a chronic treatment by PFT, an effect related to its anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative properties. The p53 pathway was down-regulated during the first week in the rat MCT model. These in vivo experiments implicate the p53 pathway at the initiation stages of PH pathogenesis.
25789975	Long noncoding RNA lincRNA-p21 is the major mediator of UVB-induced and p53-dependent apoptosis in keratinocytes.	Hall JR, Messenger ZJ, Tam HW, Phillips SL, Recio L, Smart RC.	LincRNA-p21 is a long noncoding RNA and a transcriptional target of p53 and HIF-1α. LincRNA-p21 regulates gene expression in cis and trans, mRNA translation, protein stability, the Warburg effect, and p53-dependent apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in doxorubicin-treated mouse embryo fibroblasts. p53 plays a key role in the response of skin keratinocytes to UVB-induced DNA damage by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In skin cancer development, UVB-induced mutation of p53 allows keratinocytes upon successive UVB exposures to evade apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. We hypothesized that lincRNA-p21 has a key functional role in UVB-induced apoptosis and/or cell cycle arrest in keratinocytes and loss of lincRNA-p21 function results in the evasion of apoptosis and/or cell cycle arrest. We observed that lincRNA-p21 transcripts are highly inducible by UVB in mouse and human keratinocytes in culture and in mouse skin in vivo. LincRNA-p21 is regulated at the transcriptional level in response to UVB, and the UVB induction of lincRNA-p21 in keratinocytes and in vivo in mouse epidermis is primarily through a p53-dependent pathway. Knockdown of lincRNA-p21 blocked UVB-induced apoptosis in mouse and human keratinocytes, and lincRNA-p21 was responsible for the majority of UVB-induced and p53-mediated apoptosis in keratinocytes. Knockdown of lincRNA-p21 had no effect on cell proliferation in untreated or UVB-treated keratinocytes. An early event in skin cancer is the mutation of a single p53 allele. We observed that a mutant p53(+/R172H) allele expressed in mouse epidermis (K5Cre(+/tg);LSLp53(+/R172H)) showed a significant dominant-negative inhibitory effect on UVB-induced lincRNA-p21 transcription and apoptosis in epidermis. We conclude lincRNA-p21 is highly inducible by UVB and has a key role in triggering UVB-induced apoptotic death. We propose that the mutation of a single p53 allele provides a pro-oncogenic function early in skin cancer development through a dominant inhibitory effect on UVB-induced lincRNA-p21 expression and the subsequent evasion of UVB-induced apoptosis.
25510750	Immunohistochemical detection of p53 expression in patients with preoperative chemoradiation for rectal cancer: association with prognosis.	Huh JW, Lee WY, Kim SH, Park YA, Cho YB, Yun SH, Kim HC, Park HC, Choi DH, Park JO, Park YS, Chun HK.	PURPOSE: The expression of p53 in patients with rectal cancer who underwent preoperative chemoradiation and and its potential prognostic significance were evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: p53 expression was examined using immunohistochemistry in pathologic specimens from 210 rectal cancer patients with preoperative chemoradiotherapy and radical surgery. All patients were classified into two groups according to the p53 expression: low p53 (<50% nuclear staining) and high p53 (≥50%) groups. RESULTS: p53 expression was significantly associated with tumor location from the anal verge (p=0.036). In univariate analysis, p53 expression was not associated with disease-free survival (p=0.118) or local recurrence-free survival (p=0.089). Multivariate analysis showed that tumor distance from the anal verge (p=0.006), ypN category (p=0.011), and perineural invasion (p=0.048) were independent predictors of disease-free survival; tumor distance from the anal verge was the only independent predictor of local recurrence-free survival. When the p53 groups were subdivided according to ypTNM category, disease-free survival differed significantly in patients with ypN+ disease (p=0.027) only. CONCLUSION: Expression of p53 in pathologic specimens as measured by immunohistochemical methods may have a significant prognostic impact on survival in patients with ypN+ rectal cancer with preoperative chemoradiotherapy. However, it was not an independent predictor of recurrence or survival.
26527121	Influence of P53 on the radiotherapy response of hepatocellular carcinoma.	Gomes AR, Abrantes AM, Brito AF, Laranjo M, Casalta-Lopes JE, Gonçalves AC, Sarmento-Ribeiro AB, Botelho MF, Tralhão JG.	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide, and it has a poor prognosis and few therapeutic options. Radiotherapy is one of the most effective forms of cancer treatment, and P53 protein is one of the key molecules determining how a cell responds to radiotherapy. The aim of this study was to determine the therapeutic efficacy of iodine-131 in three human HCC cell lines.Western blotting was used to measure P53 expression. The effects of radiotherapy with iodine-131 were assessed by using the clonogenic assay to evaluate cell survival. Flow cytometry was carried out to examine the effects of iodine-131 on cell death, oxidative stress, reduced intracellular glutathione expression, the mitochondrial membrane potential, and the cell cycle.The P53 protein was not expressed in Hep3B2.1-7 cells, was expressed at normal levels in HepG2 cells, and was overexpressed in HuH7 cells. P53 expression in the HuH7 and HepG2 cell lines increased after internal and external irradiation with iodine-131. Irradiation induced a decrease in cell survival and led to a decrease in cell viability in all of the cell lines studied, accompanied by cell death via late apoptosis/necrosis and necrosis. Irradiation with 131-iodine induced mostly cell-cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase.These results suggest that P53 plays a key role in the radiotherapy response of HCC.
25973395	Misfolding, Aggregation, and Disordered Segments in c-Abl and p53 in Human Cancer.	de Oliveira GA, Rangel LP, Costa DC, Silva JL.	The current understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to cancer is not sufficient to explain the loss or gain of function in proteins related to tumorigenic processes. Among them, more than 100 oncogenes, 20-30 tumor-suppressor genes, and hundreds of genes participating in DNA repair and replication have been found to play a role in the origins of cancer over the last 25 years. The phosphorylation of serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues is a critical step in cellular growth and development and is achieved through the tight regulation of protein kinases. Phosphorylation plays a major role in eukaryotic signaling as kinase domains are found in 2% of our genes. The deregulation of kinase control mechanisms has disastrous consequences, often leading to gains of function, cell transformation, and cancer. The c-Abl kinase protein is one of the most studied targets in the fight against cancer and is a hotspot for drug development because it participates in several solid tumors and is the hallmark of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Tumor suppressors have the opposite effects. Their fundamental role in the maintenance of genomic integrity has awarded them a role as the guardians of DNA. Among the tumor suppressors, p53 is the most studied. The p53 protein has been shown to be a transcription factor that recognizes and binds to specific DNA response elements and activates gene transcription. Stress triggered by ionizing radiation or other mutagenic events leads to p53 phosphorylation and cell-cycle arrest, senescence, or programed cell death. The p53 gene is the most frequently mutated gene in cancer. Mutations in the DNA-binding domain are classified as class I or class II depending on whether substitutions occur in the DNA contact sites or in the protein core, respectively. Tumor-associated p53 mutations often lead to the loss of protein function, but recent investigations have also indicated gain-of-function mutations. The prion-like aggregation of mutant p53 is associated with loss-of-function, dominant-negative, and gain-of-function effects. In the current review, we focused on the most recent insights into the protein structure and function of the c-Abl and p53 proteins that will provide us guidance to understand the loss and gain of function of these misfolded tumor-associated proteins.
25762502	Genome wide expression profiling of p53 regulated miRNAs in neuroblastoma.	Rihani A, Van Goethem A, Ongenaert M, De Brouwer S, Volders PJ, Agarwal S, De Preter K, Mestdagh P, Shohet J, Speleman F, Vandesompele J, Van Maerken T.	Restoration of the antitumor activity of p53 could offer a promising approach for the treatment of neuroblastoma. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important mediators of p53 activity, but their role in the p53 response has not yet been comprehensively addressed in neuroblastoma. Therefore, we set out to characterize alterations in miRNA expression that are induced by p53 activation in neuroblastoma cells. Genome-wide miRNA expression analysis showed that miR-34a-5p, miR-182-5p, miR-203a, miR-222-3p, and miR-432-5p are upregulated following nutlin-3 treatment in a p53 dependent manner. The function of miR-182-5p, miR-203a, miR-222-3p, and miR-432-5p was analyzed by ectopic overexpression of miRNA mimics. We observed that these p53-regulated miRNAs inhibit the proliferation of neuroblastoma cells to varying degrees, with the most profound growth inhibition recorded for miR-182-5p. Overexpression of miR-182-5p promoted apoptosis in some neuroblastoma cell lines and induced neuronal differentiation of NGP cells. Using Chromatin Immunoprecipitation-qPCR (ChIP-qPCR), we did not observe direct binding of p53 to MIR182, MIR203, MIR222, and MIR432 in neuroblastoma cells. Taken together, our findings yield new insights in the network of p53-regulated miRNAs in neuroblastoma.
26510776	The effects of a novel aliphatic-chain hydroxamate derivative WMJ-S-001 in HCT116 colorectal cancer cell death.	Huang YH, Huang SW, Hsu YF, Ou G, Huang WJ, Hsu MJ.	Hydroxamate derivatives have attracted considerable attention due to their broad pharmacological properties and have been extensively investigated. We recently demonstrated that WMJ-S-001, a novel aliphatic hydroxamate derivative, exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic activities. In this study, we explored the underlying mechanisms by which WMJ-S-001 induces HCT116 colorectal cancer cell death. WMJ-S-001 inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in HCT116 cells. These actions were associated with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, p53 phosphorylation and acetylation, as well as the modulation of p21(cip/Waf1), cyclin D1, survivin and Bax. AMPK-p38MAPK signaling blockade reduced WMJ-S-001-induced p53 phosphorylation. Transfection with AMPK dominant negative mutant (DN) reduced WMJ-S-001's effects on p53 and Sp1 binding to the survivn promoter region. Transfection with HDAC3-Flag or HDAC4-Flag also abrogated WMJ-S-001's enhancing effect on p53 acetylation. WMJ-S-001's actions on p21(cip/Waf1), cyclin D1, survivin, Bax were reduced in p53-null HCT116 cells. Furthermore, WMJ-S-001 was shown to suppress the growth of subcutaneous xenografts of HCT116 cells in vivo. In summary, the death of HCT116 colorectal cancer cells exposed to WMJ-S-001 may involve AMPK-p38MAPK-p53-survivin cascade. These results support the role of WMJ-S-001 as a potential drug candidate and warrant the clinical development in the treatment of cancer.
26001071	MAGE-A Cancer/Testis Antigens Inhibit MDM2 Ubiquitylation Function and Promote Increased Levels of MDM4.	Marcar L, Ihrig B, Hourihan J, Bray SE, Quinlan PR, Jordan LB, Thompson AM, Hupp TR, Meek DW.	Melanoma antigen A (MAGE-A) proteins comprise a structurally and biochemically similar sub-family of Cancer/Testis antigens that are expressed in many cancer types and are thought to contribute actively to malignancy. MAGE-A proteins are established regulators of certain cancer-associated transcription factors, including p53, and are activators of several RING finger-dependent ubiquitin E3 ligases. Here, we show that MAGE-A2 associates with MDM2, a ubiquitin E3 ligase that mediates ubiquitylation of more than 20 substrates including mainly p53, MDM2 itself, and MDM4, a potent p53 inhibitor and MDM2 partner that is structurally related to MDM2. We find that MAGE-A2 interacts with MDM2 via the N-terminal p53-binding pocket and the RING finger domain of MDM2 that is required for homo/hetero-dimerization and for E2 ligase interaction. Consistent with these data, we show that MAGE-A2 is a potent inhibitor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of MDM2, yet it does not have any significant effect on p53 turnover mediated by MDM2. Strikingly, however, increased MAGE-A2 expression leads to reduced ubiquitylation and increased levels of MDM4. Similarly, silencing of endogenous MAGE-A expression diminishes MDM4 levels in a manner that can be rescued by the proteasomal inhibitor, bortezomid, and permits increased MDM2/MDM4 association. These data suggest that MAGE-A proteins can: (i) uncouple the ubiquitin ligase and degradation functions of MDM2; (ii) act as potent inhibitors of E3 ligase function; and (iii) regulate the turnover of MDM4. We also find an association between the presence of MAGE-A and increased MDM4 levels in primary breast cancer, suggesting that MAGE-A-dependent control of MDM4 levels has relevance to cancer clinically.
25409149	IAPP-driven metabolic reprogramming induces regression of p53-deficient tumours in vivo.	Venkatanarayan A, Raulji P, Norton W, Chakravarti D, Coarfa C, Su X, Sandur SK, Ramirez MS, Lee J, Kingsley CV, Sananikone EF, Rajapakshe K, Naff K, Parker-Thornburg J, Bankson JA, Tsai KY, Gunaratne PH, Flores ER.	TP53 is commonly altered in human cancer, and Tp53 reactivation suppresses tumours in vivo in mice (TP53 and Tp53 are also known as p53). This strategy has proven difficult to implement therapeutically, and here we examine an alternative strategy by manipulating the p53 family members, Tp63 and Tp73 (also known as p63 and p73, respectively). The acidic transactivation-domain-bearing (TA) isoforms of p63 and p73 structurally and functionally resemble p53, whereas the ΔN isoforms (lacking the acidic transactivation domain) of p63 and p73 are frequently overexpressed in cancer and act primarily in a dominant-negative fashion against p53, TAp63 and TAp73 to inhibit their tumour-suppressive functions. The p53 family interacts extensively in cellular processes that promote tumour suppression, such as apoptosis and autophagy, thus a clear understanding of this interplay in cancer is needed to treat tumours with alterations in the p53 pathway. Here we show that deletion of the ΔN isoforms of p63 or p73 leads to metabolic reprogramming and regression of p53-deficient tumours through upregulation of IAPP, the gene that encodes amylin, a 37-amino-acid peptide co-secreted with insulin by the β cells of the pancreas. We found that IAPP is causally involved in this tumour regression and that amylin functions through the calcitonin receptor (CalcR) and receptor activity modifying protein 3 (RAMP3) to inhibit glycolysis and induce reactive oxygen species and apoptosis. Pramlintide, a synthetic analogue of amylin that is currently used to treat type 1 and type 2 diabetes, caused rapid tumour regression in p53-deficient thymic lymphomas, representing a novel strategy to target p53-deficient cancers.
26553132	miR-23a binds to p53 and enhances its association with miR-128 promoter.	Li J, Aung LH, Long B, Qin D, An S, Li P.	Apoptosis plays an important role in cardiac pathology, but the molecular mechanism by which apoptosis regulated remains largely elusive. Here, we report that miR-23a promotes the apoptotic effect of p53 in cardiomyocytes. Our results showed that miR-23a promotes apoptosis induced by oxidative stress. In exploring the molecular mechanism by which miR-23a promotes apoptosis, we found that it sensitized the effect of p53 on miR-128 regulation. It promoted the association of p53 to the promoter region of miR-128, and enhanced the transcriptional activation of p53 on miR-128 expression. miR-128 can downregulate prohibitin expression, and subsequently promote apoptosis. Our data provides novel evidence revealing that miR-23a can stimulate transcriptional activity of p53.
25713289	Endothelial p53 deletion improves angiogenesis and prevents cardiac fibrosis and heart failure induced by pressure overload in mice.	Gogiraju R, Xu X, Bochenek ML, Steinbrecher JH, Lehnart SE, Wenzel P, Kessel M, Zeisberg EM, Dobbelstein M, Schäfer K.	Cardiac dysfunction developing in response to chronic pressure overload is associated with apoptotic cell death and myocardial vessel rarefaction. We examined whether deletion of tumor suppressor p53 in endothelial cells may prevent the transition from cardiac hypertrophy to heart failure.Mice with endothelial-specific deletion of p53 (End.p53-KO) were generated by crossing p53fl/fl mice with mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of an inducible Tie2 promoter. Cardiac hypertrophy was induced by transverse aortic constriction. Serial echocardiography measurements revealed improved cardiac function in End.p53-KO mice that also exhibited better survival. Cardiac hypertrophy was associated with increased p53 levels in End.p53-WT controls, whereas banded hearts of End.p53-KO mice exhibited lower numbers of apoptotic endothelial and non-endothelial cells and altered mRNA levels of genes regulating cell cycle progression (p21), apoptosis (Puma), or proliferation (Pcna). A higher cardiac capillary density and improved myocardial perfusion was observed, and pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of p53 also promoted endothelial sprouting in vitro and new vessel formation following hindlimb ischemia in vivo. Hearts of End.p53-KO mice exhibited markedly less fibrosis compared with End.p53-WT controls, and lower mRNA levels of p53-regulated genes involved in extracellular matrix production and turnover (eg, Bmp-7, Ctgf, or Pai-1), or of transcription factors involved in controlling mesenchymal differentiation were observed.Our analyses reveal that accumulation of p53 in endothelial cells contributes to blood vessel rarefaction and fibrosis during chronic cardiac pressure overload and suggest that endothelial cells may be a therapeutic target for preserving cardiac function during hypertrophy.
26513723	The Role of Structural Elements of the 5'-Terminal Region of p53 mRNA in Translation under Stress Conditions Assayed by the Antisense Oligonucleotide Approach.	Swiatkowska A, Zydowicz P, Gorska A, Suchacka J, Dutkiewicz M, Ciesiołka J.	The p53 protein is one of the major factors responsible for cell cycle regulation and stress response. In the 5'-terminal region of p53 mRNA, an IRES element has been found which takes part in the translational regulation of p53 expression. Two characteristic hairpin motifs are present in this mRNA region: G56-C169, with the first AUG codon, and U180-A218, which interacts with the Hdm2 protein (human homolog of mouse double minute 2 protein). 2'-OMe modified antisense oligomers hybridizing to the 5'-terminal region of p53 mRNA were applied to assess the role of these structural elements in translation initiation under conditions of cellular stress. Structural changes in the RNA target occurring upon oligomers' binding were monitored by the Pb2+-induced cleavage method. The impact of antisense oligomers on the synthesis of two proteins, the full-length p53 and its isoform Δ40p53, was analysed in HT-29, MCF-7 and HepG2 cells, under normal conditions and under stress, as well as in vitro conditions. The results revealed that the hairpin U180-A218 and adjacent single-stranded region A219-A228 were predominantly responsible for high efficacy of IRES-mediated translation in the presence of stress factors. These motifs play a role of cis-acting elements which are able to modulate IRES activity, likely via interactions with protein factors.
26163638	P53 and MDM2 Over-expression and Five-year Survival of Kidney Cancer Patients Undergoing Radical Nephrectomy--Iranian Experience.	Abolhasani M, Salarinejad S, Asgari M.	BACKGROUND: Relatively little is known with certainty about the status and role of p53 or MDM2 in predicting prognosis and survival of renal cell carcinoma. The present study aimed to determine the value of P53 and MDM2 over-expression, alone and simultaneously, to predict five-year survival of patients with kidney cancer in Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with kidney cancer referred to Hasheminejad Kidney Center between 2007 and 2009, underwent radical nephrectomy and had pathology reports of clear cell, papillary or chromophobe renal cell carcinoma were included in our cohort study. Other histological types of renal cell carcinoma were not included. The patients with missed, incomplete or poor quality paraffin blocks were also excluded. Overall ninety one patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. To assess the histopathological features of the tumor, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples were performed. The five-year survival was determined by the patients' medical files and telephone following-up. RESULTS: In total, 1.1% of all samples were revealed to be positive for P53. Also, 20.8% of all samples were revealed to be positive for MDM2.The patients were all followed for 5 years. In this regard, 5-year mortality was 30.5% and thus 5-year survival was 85.3%. According to the Cox proportional hazard analysis, positive P53 marker was only predictor for patients' 5-year survival that the presence of positive p53 increased the risk for long-term mortality up to 2.8 times (HR=2.798, 95%CI: 1.176-6.660, P=0.020). However, the presence of MDM2 could not predict long-term mortality. In this regard, analysis by the ROC curve showed a limited role for predicting long-term survival by confirming P53 positivity (AUC=0.610, 95%CI: 0.471-.750, P=0.106). The best cutoff point for P53 to predict mortality was 0.5 yielding a low sensitivity (32.0%) but a high specificity (97.9%). In similar analysis, measurement of MDM2 positivity could not predict mortality (AUC=0.449, 95%CI: 0.316-.583, P=0.455). CONCLUSIONS: The simultaneous presence of both P53 and MDM2 markers in our population is a rare phenomenon and the presence of these markers may not predict long-term survival in patients who undergoing radical nephrectomy.
26009308	Immunohistochemical co-expression status of cytokeratin 5/6, androgen receptor, and p53 as prognostic factors of adjuvant chemotherapy for triple negative breast cancer.	Maeda T, Nakanishi Y, Hirotani Y, Fuchinoue F, Enomoto K, Sakurai K, Amano S, Nemoto N.	Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is immunohistochemically characterised by the lack of expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2). TNBC is known for its poor prognosis and high recurrence probability. There is no effective targeted treatment for TNBC, but only adjuvant chemotherapies. There are two TNBC subtypes, basal-like and non-basal-like, which are defined based on positive cytokeratin (CK) 5/6 and/or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression. In particular, CK5/6 expression is reported to correlate with TNBC recurrence. TNBC lacks ER-α expression, but some TNBCs are known to express the androgen receptor (AR). Moreover, although p53 accumulation is detected in various malignant tumors, its influence on adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with TNBC remains unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the combined immunohistochemical expression of CK 5/6, AR, and p53 as a potential prognostic marker of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with TNBC. The expression of CK5/6, AR, and p53 in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) surgical sections from 52 patients with TNBC was analysed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and the co-expression patterns in individual cells were investigated by immunofluorescent (IF) staining. Low AR expression was correlated with high clinical stage (P < 0.05) and low nuclear grade (P < 0.05). The expression of CK5/6 and p53 did not correlate with clinicopathological features. Patients who needed adjuvant chemotherapy presented the worst prognosis. In particular, when the IHC expression pattern was CK5/6 (-), AR (-), and p53 (+), the disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were the worst. On the other hand, patients with AR (+) and p53 (-) TNBC presented a good prognosis. The analysis of the co-expression status of these three markers showed that no cells presented both AR and CK5/6 expression. Furthermore, TP53 mRNA expression was higher in patients with AR-negative TNBC (P < 0.05) and in patients with the worst prognosis (P < 0.05) than in the other patients. These results suggested that, in patients with CK5/6-negative TNBC, AR expression correlated with good prognosis, but p53 accumulation correlated with poor prognosis. The present IHC markers allowed us to predict the post-surgery prognosis of patients with TNBC. In conclusion, TNBCs are heterogeneous. Patients with the CK5/6 (-), AR (-), and p53 (+) TNBC subtype, evaluated by IHC, presented the worst prognosis. These IHC markers will be helpful to follow patients with TNBC.
25460562	Persistence of Human Papillomavirus, Overexpression of p53, and Outcomes of Patients After Endoscopic Ablation of Barrett's Esophagus.	Rajendra S, Wang B, Pavey D, Sharma P, Yang T, Lee CS, Gupta N, Ball MJ, Gill RS, Wu X.	We investigated the role of high-risk human papillomavirus (hr-HPV) in patients with Barrett's dysplasia and adenocarcinoma (EAC). Clearance vs persistence of HPV (DNA, E6 or E7 mRNA, and p16INK4A protein) and overexpression or mutation of p53 were determined for 40 patients who underwent endotherapy for Barrett's dysplasia or EAC. After ablation, dysplasia or neoplasia was eradicated in 34 subjects (24 squamous, 10 intestinal metaplasia). Six patients had detectable lesions after treatment; 2 were positive for transcriptionally active hr-HPV, and 4 had overexpression of p53. Before endotherapy, 15 patients had biologically active hr-HPV, 13 cleared the infection with treatment, and dysplasia or EAC was eliminated from 12 patients. One patient who cleared HPV after ablation acquired a p53 mutation, and their cancer progressed. Of 13 patients with overexpression of p53 before treatment, 10 cleared the p53 abnormality after ablation with eradication of dysplasia or neoplasia, whereas 3 of 13 had persistent p53 mutation-associated dysplasia after endotherapy (P = .004). Immunohistochemical and sequence analyses of p53 produced concordant results for 36 of 40 samples (90%). Detection of dysplasia or neoplasia after treatment was associated with HPV persistence or continued p53 overexpression.
25480384	Tumor suppressor ataxia telangiectasia mutated functions downstream of TGF-β1 in orchestrating profibrotic responses.	Overstreet JM, Samarakoon R, Cardona-Grau D, Goldschmeding R, Higgins PJ.	Effective therapy to prevent organ fibrosis, which is associated with more than half of all mortalities, remains elusive. Involvement of tumor suppressor ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) in the TGF-β1 pathway related to renal fibrosis is largely unknown. ATM activation (pATM(Ser1981)) increased 4-fold in the tubulointerstitial region of the unilateral ureteral obstruction-injured kidney in mice correlating with SMAD3 and p53(Ser15) phosphorylation and elevated levels of p22(phox) subunit of the NADPH oxidases (NOXs), and fibrotic markers, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and fibronectin, when compared to contralateral (contra) or sham controls. In fact, ATM is rapidly phosphorylated at Ser(1981) by TGF-β1 stimulation. Stable silencing and pharmacologic inhibition of ATM ablated TGF-β1-induced p53 activation (>95%) and subsequent PAI-1, fibronectin, connective tissue growth factor, and p21 expression in human kidney 2 (HK-2) tubular epithelial cells and normal rat kidney-49 fibroblasts (NRK-49F). ATM or p53 depletion in HK-2 cells, moreover, bypassed TGF-β1-mediated cytostasis evident in control short hairpin RNA-expressing HK-2 cells. Interestingly, stable silencing of NOX subunits, p22(phox) and p47(phox), in HK-2 cells blocked TGF-β1-induced pATM(Ser1981) (>90%) and target gene induction via p53-dependent mechanisms. Furthermore, NRK-49F fibroblast proliferation triggered by conditioned media from TGF-β1-stimulated, control vector-transfected HK-2 cells decreased (∼ 50%) when exposed to conditioned media from ATM-deficient, TGF-β1-treated HK-2 cells. Thus, TGF-β1 promotes NOX-dependent ATM activation leading to p53-mediated fibrotic gene reprogramming and growth arrest in HK-2 cells. Furthermore, TGF-β1/ATM-initiated paracrine factor secretion by dysfunctional renal epithelium promotes interstitial fibroblast growth, suggesting a role of tubular ATM in mediating epithelial-mesenchymal cross-talk highlighting the translational benefit of targeting the NOX/ATM/p53 axis in renal fibrosis.
25489053	A novel manganese-dependent ATM-p53 signaling pathway is selectively impaired in patient-based neuroprogenitor and murine striatal models of Huntington's disease.	Tidball AM, Bryan MR, Uhouse MA, Kumar KK, Aboud AA, Feist JE, Ess KC, Neely MD, Aschner M, Bowman AB.	The essential micronutrient manganese is enriched in brain, especially in the basal ganglia. We sought to identify neuronal signaling pathways responsive to neurologically relevant manganese levels, as previous data suggested that alterations in striatal manganese handling occur in Huntington's disease (HD) models. We found that p53 phosphorylation at serine 15 is the most responsive cell signaling event to manganese exposure (of 18 tested) in human neuroprogenitors and a mouse striatal cell line. Manganese-dependent activation of p53 was severely diminished in HD cells. Inhibitors of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase decreased manganese-dependent phosphorylation of p53. Likewise, analysis of ATM autophosphorylation and additional ATM kinase targets, H2AX and CHK2, support a role for ATM in the activation of p53 by manganese and that a defect in this process occurs in HD. Furthermore, the deficit in Mn-dependent activation of ATM kinase in HD neuroprogenitors was highly selective, as DNA damage and oxidative injury, canonical activators of ATM, did not show similar deficits. We assessed cellular manganese handling to test for correlations with the ATM-p53 pathway, and we observed reduced Mn accumulation in HD human neuroprogenitors and HD mouse striatal cells at manganese exposures associated with altered p53 activation. To determine if this phenotype contributes to the deficit in manganese-dependent ATM activation, we used pharmacological manipulation to equalize manganese levels between HD and control mouse striatal cells and rescued the ATM-p53 signaling deficit. Collectively, our data demonstrate selective alterations in manganese biology in cellular models of HD manifest in ATM-p53 signaling.
25553088	Upregulation of Acetylcholinesterase Mediated by p53 Contributes to Cisplatin-Induced Apoptosis in Human Breast Cancer Cell.	Ye X, Zhang C, Chen Y, Zhou T.	BACKGROUND: The expression of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) could be induced during apoptosis in various cell types. And reduced AChE expression either by siRNA could prevent apoptosis. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying the AChE regulation are largely unknown in human breast cancer cell. MATERIAL AND METHODS: MCF-7 cells were cultured and treated by cisplatin in the absence or presence of p53 siRNA. RESULTS: In this study, the regulation of AChE expression during apoptosis induced by cisplatin, a current used anticancer drug, was investigated in human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Exposure of MCF-7 cells to cisplatin resulted in apoptosis in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Meanwhile, the upregulated AChE and p53 were also observed during apoptosis. Silencing interfering RNA directed against p53 blocked the expression of AChE. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results suggested that AChE expression could be upregulated by the activation of p53 during apoptosis induced by cisplatin in MCF-7 cells.
26459098	Chk1 phosphorylated at serine(345) is a predictor of early local recurrence and radio-resistance in breast cancer.	Alsubhi N, Middleton F, Abdel-Fatah TM, Stephens P, Doherty R, Arora A, Moseley PM, Chan SY, Aleskandarany MA, Green AR, Rakha EA, Ellis IO, Martin SG, Curtin NJ, Madhusudan S.	Radiation-induced DNA damage activates the DNA damage response (DDR). DDR up-regulation may predict radio-resistance and increase the risk of early local recurrence despite radiotherapy in early stage breast cancers. In 1755 early stage breast cancers, DDR signalling [ATM, ATR, total Ckh1, Chk1 phosphorylated at serine(345) (pChk1), Chk2, p53], base excision repair [PARP1, POLβ, XRCC1, FEN1, SMUG1], non-homologous end joining (Ku70/Ku80, DNA-PKcs) and homologous recombination [RAD51, BRCA1, γH2AX, BLM, WRN, RECQL5, PTEN] protein expression was correlated to time to early local recurrence. Pre-clinically, radio-sensitization by inhibition of Chk1 activation by ATR inhibitor (VE-821) and inhibition of Chk1 (V158411) were investigated in MDA-MB-231 (p53 mutant) and MCF-7 (p53 wild-type) breast cancer cells. In the whole cohort, 208/1755 patients (11.9%) developed local recurrence of which 126 (61%) developed local recurrence within 5 years of initiation of primary therapy. Of the 20 markers tested, only pChk1 and p53 significantly associated with early local recurrence (p value = 0.015 and 0.010, respectively). When analysed together, high cytoplasmic pChk1-nuclear pChk1 (p = 0.039), high cytoplasmic pChk1-p53 (p = 0.004) and high nuclear pChk1-p53 (p = 0.029) co-expression remain significantly linked to early local recurrence. In multivariate analysis, cytoplasmic pChk1 level independently predicted early local recurrence (p = 0.025). In patients who received adjuvant local radiotherapy (n = 949), p53 (p = 0.014) and high cytoplasmic pChk1-p53 (p = 0.017) remain associated with early local recurrence. Pre-clinically, radio-sensitisation by VE-821 or V158411 was observed in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells and was more pronounced in MCF-7 cells. We conclude that pChk1 is a predictive biomarker of radiotherapy resistance and early local recurrence.
26076776	Expression of p53 protein product in triple negative breast cancers and relation with clinical and histopathological parameters.	Jasar Dz, Smichkoska S, Kubelka K, Filipovski V, Petrushevska G.	(Full text is available at http://www.manu.edu.mk/prilozi)."Triple" negative breast cancer is a subgroup of so-called basal-like breast cancer. They are represented with 15% of all breast cancers, characterized with lack of hormone receptor as well as with negative expression of HER2 test. These tumors are more frequent in Afro-Americans and Latin-Americans, in patients with BRCA1 mutations and in patients with recent delivery. The aim of this study is to present the immunohistochemical and clinico-pathological characteristics of the triple negative breast cancer and their correlation with expression of the protein product of the tumor suppressor gene p53.A retrospective analyses of 24 patients with triple negative breast cancer was performed. All of the patients were evaluated in the Histopathological Laboratory of the Clinical Hospital Sistina, during the period from June 2009, until June 2011. The standard immunohistochemical procedures, including the hormone receptor status, HER2 status, proliferative index - Ki67 and p53 gene protein product were performed, as well as additional immunohistochemical staining for so-called basal keratins (Cytokeratin 5/6 and high molecular weight cytokeratin 34BE12).The age of the patients ranged from 29-77 years. Positive lymph nodes were found in 14 (59%) patients. The tumor was poorly differentiated in 19 patients (79%). Overexpression of the p53 protein product was evaluated in 19 (79%) of the cases. All p53 negative patients (5/5) had poorly differentiated tumors (G3), associated with positive regional lymph nodes. The p53 positive group expressed quite opposite correlation, only 9/19 (47%) were with positive lymph nodes (p = 0.03). The expression of p53 protein product was also associated with the nuclear grade (p = 0.005), the mitotic index (p = 0.001), lymph-vascular invasion (p = 0.005) and with the proliferation index Ki67 (p = 0.003). There was a trend for association with the tumor size - pT (p = 0.05).According to the results, the triple negative breast cancers are subgroup of the poorly differentiated neoplasms frequently associated in the younger age groups. The majority of these have overexpression of the p53 protein product, which in other hand, are inversely correlated with lymph nodes metastases. Hence, the necessity of enriching the immunohistochemical protocol of these patients with new antibodies, in order to evaluate their expression, which would be helpful for prediction the outcome of different therapeutical modalities. Key words: breast cancer, triple negative, p53 protein product.
25596429	Role of p53-fibrinolytic system cross-talk in the regulation of quartz-induced lung injury.	Bhandary YP, Shetty SK, Marudamuthu AS, Fu J, Pinson BM, Levin J, Shetty S.	Silica is the major component of airborne dust generated by wind, manufacturing and/or demolition. Chronic occupational inhalation of silica dust containing crystalline quartz is by far the predominant form of silicosis in humans. Silicosis is a progressive lung disease that typically arises after a very long latency and is a major occupational concern with no known effective treatment. The mechanism of silicosis is not clearly understood. However, silicosis is associated with increased cell death, expression of redox enzymes and pro-fibrotic cytokines and chemokines. Since alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) death and disruption of alveolar fibrinolysis is often associated with both acute and chronic lung injuries, we explored whether p53-mediated changes in the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) system contributes to silica-induced lung injury. We further sought to determine whether caveolin-1 scaffolding domain peptide (CSP), which inhibits p53 expression, mitigates lung injury associated with exposure to silica. Lung tissues and AECs isolated from wild-type (WT) mice exposed to silica exhibit increased apoptosis, p53 and PAI-1, and suppression of uPA expression. Treatment of WT mice with CSP inhibits PAI-1, restores uPA expression and prevents AEC apoptosis by suppressing p53, which is otherwise induced in mice exposed to silica. The process involves CSP-mediated inhibition of serine-15 phosphorylation of p53 by inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A-C (PP2A-C) interaction with silica-induced caveolin-1 in AECs. These observations suggest that changes in the p53-uPA fibrinolytic system cross-talk contribute to lung injury caused by inhalation of silica dust containing crystalline quartz and is protected by CSP by targeting this pathway.
26399548	Acute DNA damage activates the tumour suppressor p53 to promote radiation-induced lymphoma.	Lee CL, Castle KD, Moding EJ, Blum JM, Williams N, Luo L, Ma Y, Borst LB, Kim Y, Kirsch DG.	Genotoxic cancer therapies, such as chemoradiation, cause haematological toxicity primarily by activating the tumour suppressor p53. While inhibiting p53-mediated cell death during cancer therapy ameliorates haematologic toxicity, whether it also impacts carcinogenesis remains unclear. Here we utilize a mouse model of inducible p53 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to show that temporarily blocking p53 during total-body irradiation (TBI) not only ameliorates acute toxicity, but also improves long-term survival by preventing lymphoma development. Using Kras(LA1) mice, we show that TBI promotes the expansion of a rare population of thymocytes that express oncogenic Kras(G12D). However, blocking p53 during TBI significantly suppresses the expansion of Kras(G12D)-expressing thymocytes. Mechanistically, bone marrow transplant experiments demonstrate that TBI activates p53 to decrease the ability of bone marrow cells to suppress lymphoma development through a non-cell-autonomous mechanism. Together, our results demonstrate that the p53 response to acute DNA damage promotes the development of radiation-induced lymphoma.
26516353	Nucleocytoplasmic Translocation of UBXN2A Is Required for Apoptosis during DNA Damage Stresses in Colon Cancer Cells.	Abdullah A, Sane S, Freeling JL, Wang H, Zhang D, Rezvani K.	The subcellular localization, expression level, and activity of anti-cancer proteins alter in response to intrinsic and extrinsic cellular stresses to reverse tumor progression. The purpose of this study is to determine whether UBXN2A, an activator of the p53 tumor suppressor protein, has different subcellular compartmentalization in response to the stress of DNA damage. We measured trafficking of the UBXN2A protein in response to two different DNA damage stresses, UVB irradiation and the genotoxic agent Etoposide, in colon cancer cell lines. Using a cytosol-nuclear fractionation technique followed by western blot and immunofluorescence staining, we monitored and quantitated UBXN2A and p53 proteins as well as p53's downstream apoptotic pathway. We showed that the anti-cancer protein UBXN2A acts in the early phase of cell response to two different DNA damage stresses, being induced to translocate into the cytoplasm in a dose- and time-dependent manner. UVB-induced cytoplasmic UBXN2A binds to mortalin-2 (mot-2), a known oncoprotein in colon tumors. UVB-dependent upregulation of UBXN2A in the cytoplasm decreases p53 binding to mot-2 and activates apoptotic events in colon cancer cells. In contrast, the shRNA-mediated depletion of UBXN2A leads to significant reduction in apoptosis in colon cancer cells exposed to UVB and Etoposide. Leptomycin B (LMB), which was able to block UBXN2A nuclear export following Etoposide treatment, sustained p53-mot-2 interaction and had partially antagonistic effects with Etoposide on cell apoptosis. The present study shows that nucleocytoplasmic translocation of UBXN2A in response to stresses is necessary for its anti-cancer function in the cytoplasm. In addition, LMB-dependent suppression of UBXN2A's translocation to the cytoplasm upon stress allows the presence of an active mot-2 oncoprotein in the cytoplasm, resulting in p53 sequestration as well as activation of other mot-2-dependent growth promoting pathways.
25543083	Phosphomimetic mutation of the N-terminal lid of MDM2 enhances the polyubiquitination of p53 through stimulation of E2-ubiquitin thioester hydrolysis.	Fraser JA, Worrall EG, Lin Y, Landre V, Pettersson S, Blackburn E, Walkinshaw M, Muller P, Vojtesek B, Ball K, Hupp TR.	Mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) has a phosphorylation site within a lid motif at Ser17 whose phosphomimetic mutation to Asp17 stimulates MDM2-mediated polyubiquitination of p53. MDM2 lid deletion, but not Asp17 mutation, induced a blue shift in the λ(max) of intrinsic fluorescence derived from residues in the central domain including Trp235, Trp303, Trp323, and Trp329. This indicates that the Asp17 mutation does not alter the conformation of MDM2 surrounding the tryptophan residues. In addition, Phe235 mutation enhanced MDM2 binding to p53 but did not stimulate its ubiquitination function, thus uncoupling increases in p53 binding from its E3 ubiquitin ligase function. However, the Asp17 mutation in MDM2 stimulated its discharge of the UBCH5a-ubiquitin thioester adduct (UBCH5a is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2D 1 UBC4/5 homolog yeast). This stimulation of ubiquitin discharge from E2 was independent of the p53 substrate. There are now four known effects of the Asp17 mutation on MDM2: (i) it alters the conformation of the isolated N-terminus as defined by NMR; (ii) it induces increased thermostability of the isolated N-terminal domain; (iii) it stimulates the allosteric interaction of MDM2 with the DNA-binding domain of p53; and (iv) it stimulates a novel protein-protein interaction with the E2-ubiquitin complex in the absence of substrate p53 that, in turn, increases hydrolysis of the E2-ubiquitin thioester bond. These data also suggest a new strategy to disrupt MDM2 function by targeting the E2-ubiquitin discharge reaction.
26564741	[Circadian rhythm variation of the clock genes Per1 and cell cycle related genes in different stages of carcinogenesis of buccal mucosa in animal model].	Tan X, Ye H, Yang K, Chen D, Tang H.	To investigate the expression and circadian rhythm variation of biological clock gene Per1 and cell cycle genes p53, CyclinD1, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK1), CyclinB1 in different stages of carcinogenesis in buccal mucosa and its relationship with the development of buccal mucosa carcinoma.Ninety golden hamsters were housed under 12 hours light-12 hours dark cycles, and the model of buccal squamous cell carcinoma was established by using the dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) to smear the golden hamster buccal mucosa. Before the DMBA was used and after DMBA was used 6 weeks and 14 weeks respectively, the golden hamsters were sacrificed at 6 different time points (5 rats per time point) within 24 hour, including 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 hour after lights onset (HALO), and the normal buccal mucosa, precancerous lesions and cancer tissue were obtained, respectively. HE stained sections were prepared to observe the canceration of each tissue. Real time RT-PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of Per1, p53, CyclinD1, CDK1 and CyclinB1, and a cosine analysis method was applied to determine the circadian rhythm variation of Per1, p53, CyclinD1, CDK1 and CyclinB1 mRNA expression, which were characterized by median, amplitude and acrophase.The expression of Per1, p53, CDK1 and CyclinD1 mRNA in 6 different time points within 24 hours in the tissues of three different stages of carcinogenesis had circadian rhythm, respectively. However, the CyclinB1 mRNA was expressed with circadian rhythm just in normal and cancer tissue (P < 0.05), while in precancerous lesions the circadian rhythm was in disorder (P > 0.05). As the development of carcinoma, the median of Per1 and p53 mRNA expression were significantly decreased (P < 0.05), yet the median of CDK1, CyclinB1 and CyclinD1 mRNA expression were significantly increased (P < 0.05). The amplitude of Per1, p53 and CyclinD1 mRNA expression was significantly decreased as the development of carcinoma (P < 0.05), however the amplitude of CDK1 mRNA expression was significantly increased (P < 0.05). In addition, there was no significant difference in the amplitude of CyclinB1 mRNA expression. The time that the peak expression value of Per1 and CDK1 mRNA appeared (Acrophase) in precancerous lesions was remarkably earlier than that in normal tissues, but the acrophase of p53 and CyclinD1 mRNA expression was remarkably delayed. Moreover, the acrophase of CDK1 and CyclinB1 mRNA expression in cancer tissues was obviously earlier than that in normal tissues, yet there was no significant variation in acrophase of Per1, p53, CyclinD1 mRNA expression between normal tissues and cancer tissues.The circadian rhythm of clock gene Per1 and cell cycle genes p53, CyclinD1, CDK1, CyclinB1 expression remarkably varied with the occurrence and development of carcinoma. Further research into the interaction between circadian and cell cycle of two cycle activity and relationship with the carcinogenesis may providenew ideas and methods of individual treatment and the mechanism of carcinogenesis.
26563498	N-Methyl, N-propynyl-2-phenylethylamine (MPPE), a Selegiline Analog, Attenuates MPTP-induced Dopaminergic Toxicity with Guaranteed Behavioral Safety: Involvement of Inhibitions of Mitochondrial Oxidative Burdens and p53 Gene-elicited Pro-apoptotic Change.	Shin EJ, Nam Y, Lee JW, Nguyen PT, Yoo JE, Tran TV, Jeong JH, Jang CG, Oh YJ, Youdim MB, Lee PH, Nabeshima T, Kim HC.	Selegiline is a monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitor with anti-Parkinsonian effects, but it is metabolized to amphetamines. Since another MAO-B inhibitor N-Methyl, N-propynyl-2-phenylethylamine (MPPE) is not metabolized to amphetamines, we examined whether MPPE induces behavioral side effects and whether MPPE affects dopaminergic toxicity induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Multiple doses of MPPE (2.5 and 5 mg/kg/day) did not show any significant locomotor activity and conditioned place preference, whereas selegiline (2.5 and 5 mg/kg/day) significantly increased these behavioral side effects. Treatment with MPPE resulted in significant attenuations against decreases in mitochondrial complex I activity, mitochondrial Mn-SOD activity, and expression induced by MPTP in the striatum of mice. Consistently, MPPE significantly attenuated MPTP-induced oxidative stress and MPPE-mediated antioxidant activity appeared to be more pronounced in mitochondrial-fraction than in cytosolic-fraction. Because MPTP promoted mitochondrial p53 translocation and p53/Bcl-xL interaction, it was also examined whether mitochondrial p53 inhibitor pifithrin-μ attenuates MPTP neurotoxicity. MPPE, selegiline, or pifithrin-μ significantly attenuated mitochondrial p53/Bcl-xL interaction, impaired mitochondrial transmembrane potential, cytosolic cytochrome c release, and cleaved caspase-3 in wild-type mice. Subsequently, these compounds significantly ameliorated MPTP-induced motor impairments. Neuroprotective effects of MPPE appeared to be more prominent than those of selegiline. MPPE or selegiline did not show any additional protective effects against the attenuation by p53 gene knockout, suggesting that p53 gene is a critical target for these compounds. Our results suggest that MPPE possesses anti-Parkinsonian potentials with guaranteed behavioral safety and that the underlying mechanism of MPPE requires inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative stress, mitochondrial translocation of p53, and pro-apoptotic process.
26131199	Clinicopathologic significance and survival of TIP30 expression in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.	Chen J, Zhu C, Zhu M, Geng M, Tian Y, Li G, Zheng H.	BACKGROUND: The expression and clinical significance of TIP30 and p53 in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) have not been investigated. METHOD: We determined immunohistochemically the expression of TIP30 and p53 in surgical specimens from 105 patients with LSCC. Survivals were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: TIP30 protein expression in LSCC patients was significantly less in tumor tissues than that of adjacent normal tissues (46.7% vs. 79.0%), while p53 protein expression was significantly increased in LSCC (15.2% vs. 63.8%) compared with adjacent normal tissues. The TIP30 expression levels were also significantly correlated with tumor stage, differentiation, and the presence of lymph nodes. The expression of TIP30 was significantly negatively correlated with that of p53 (r = -0.249, P = 0.010). LSCC patients with lower expression level of TIP30 had a significantly higher recurrence and worse overall survival than those with elevated TIP30 expression (P = 0.014 and P = 0.040, respectively). Furthermore, multivariable analysis found that patients with high expression of TIP30 had a greater than approximately 2.2-fold increased risk for death overall or recurrence than those with low expression of TIP30, supporting that down-regulation of TIP30 expression in tumors may involve in development and progression and predict poor prognosis of patients with LSCC. CONCLUSION: Our results may suggest that down-expression of TIP30 is closely related to carcinogenesis, progression, biological behavior, and prognosis of LSCC.
25305590	A proteomic analysis of p53-independent induction of apoptosis by bortezomib in 4T1 breast cancer cell line.	Yerlikaya A, Okur E, Baykal AT, Acılan C, Boyacı I, Ulukaya E.	The 26S proteasome is a proteolytic enzyme found in both cytoplasm and nucleus. In this study, we examined the differential expression of proteasome inhibitor bortezomib-induced proteins in p53-deficient 4T1 cells. It was found that GRP78 and TCEB2 were over-expressed in response to treatment with bortezomib for 24h. Next, we analyzed the expression of intracellular proteins in response to treatment with 100nM bortezomib for 24h by label-free LC-MS/MS. These analyses showed that Hsp70, the 26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 14 and sequestosome 1 were increased at least 2 fold in p53-deficient 4T1 cells. The proteins identified by label-free LC-MS/MS were then analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) Tool to determine biological networks affected by inhibition of the 26S proteasome. The analysis results showed that post-translational modifications, protein folding, DNA replication, energy production and nucleic acid metabolism were found to be among the top functions affected by the 26S proteasome inhibition. The biological network analysis indicated that ubiquitin may be the central regulator of the pathways modulated after bortezomib-treatment. Further investigation of the mechanism of the proteins modulated in response to the proteasomal inhibition may lead to the design of more effective and novel therapeutic strategies for cancer.Although the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is approved and used for the treatment of human cancer (multiple myeloma), the mechanism of action is not entirely understood. A number of studies showed that proteasome inhibitors induced apoptosis through upregulation of tumor suppressor protein p53. However, the role of tumor suppressor protein p53 in bortezomib-induced apoptosis is controversial and not well-understood. The tumor suppressor p53 is mutated in at least 50% of human cancers and is strongly induced by proteasomal inhibition. Some also reported that the proteasome inhibitor can induce apoptosis in a p53-independent manner. Also, it is reported that Noxa, a target of p53, is induced in response to proteasomal inhibition in a p53-independent manner. However, we have also previously reported that neither Puma nor Noxa are induced by proteasomal inhibition in p53-null 4T1 breast cancer cells, which is commonly used for in vivo breast cancer tumor models. The current results provided additional targets of proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and may therefore help in understanding the p53-independent mechanism of apoptosis induction by proteasome inhibitors. In addition, the results presented in this current study report for the first time that proteasomal subunit Psmd14, anti-apoptotic GRP78, anti apoptotic protein Card10, Dffb, Traf3 and Trp53bp2 are regulated and overexpressed in response to proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in p53-deficient 4T1 cells. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies targeting these anti-apoptotic or pro-apoptotic proteins as well as inhibiting the proteasome simultaneously may be more effective against cancer cells. The proteins identified here present new avenues for the development of anti-cancer drugs.
25831048	Cisplatin fails to induce puma mediated apoptosis in mucosal melanomas.	Fritsche MK, Metzler V, Becker K, Plettenberg C, Heiser C, Hofauer B, Knopf A.	OBJECTIVES: Mucosal melanomas (MM) are aggressive subtypes of common melanomas. It remains unclear whether limitations in their resectability or their distinctive molecular mechanisms are responsible for the aggressive phenotype. METHODS: In total, 112 patients with cutaneous melanomas (CM) and 27 patients with MM were included. Clinical parameters were analysed using Chi square, Fisher exact and student's t-test. Survival rates were calculated by Kaplan-Meier. Analysis of p53, p21, Mdm2, Hipk2, Gadd45, Puma, Bax, Casp9 and Cdk1 via quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed. TP53 induction after cisplatin treatment was analysed in 10 cell lines (melanocytes, four MM and five CM) using western blot (WB) and qPCR. RESULTS: The overall/recurrence-free survival differed significantly between MM (40 months and 30 months) and CM (90 months and 107 months; p < 0.001). IHC and WB confirmed high p53 expression in all melanomas. Hipk2 and Gadd45 showed significantly higher expressions in CM (p < 0.005; p = 0.004). QPCR and WB of wild-type cell lines demonstrated no differences for p53, p21, Mdm2, Bax and Casp9. WB failed to detect Puma in MM, while Cdk1 regulation occurred exclusively in MM. CONCLUSIONS: The aggressive phenotype of MM did not appear to be due to differential expressions of p53, p21, Mdm2, Bax or Casp9. A non-functional apoptosis in MM may have further clinical implications.
25562686	The selective activation of p53 target genes regulated by SMYD2 in BIX-01294 induced autophagy-related cell death.	Fan JD, Lei PJ, Zheng JY, Wang X, Li S, Liu H, He YL, Wang ZN, Wei G, Zhang X, Li LY, Wu M.	Transcription regulation emerged to be one of the key mechanisms in regulating autophagy. Inhibitors of H3K9 methylation activates the expression of LC3B, as well as other autophagy-related genes, and promotes autophagy process. However, the detailed mechanisms of autophagy regulated by nuclear factors remain elusive. In this study, we performed a drug screen of SMYD2-/- cells and discovered that SMYD2 deficiency enhanced the cell death induced by BIX01294, an inhibitor of histone H3K9 methylation. BIX-01294 induces accumulation of LC3 II and autophagy-related cell death, but not caspase-dependent apoptosis. We profiled the global gene expression pattern after treatment with BIX-01294, in comparison with rapamycin. BIX-01294 selectively activates the downstream genes of p53 signaling, such as p21 and DOR, but not PUMA, a typical p53 target gene inducing apoptosis. BIX-01294 also induces other autophagy-related genes, such as ATG4A and ATG9A. SMYD2 is a methyltransferase for p53 and regulates its transcription activity. Its deficiency enhances the BIX-01294-induced autophagy-related cell death through transcriptionally promoting the expression of p53 target genes. Taken together, our data suggest BIX-01294 induces autophagy-related cell death and selectively activates p53 target genes, which is repressed by SMYD2 methyltransferase.
25844600	Pre-clinical evaluation of the MDM2-p53 antagonist RG7388 alone and in combination with chemotherapy in neuroblastoma.	Chen L, Rousseau RF, Middleton SA, Nichols GL, Newell DR, Lunec J, Tweddle DA.	Neuroblastoma is a predominantly p53 wild-type (wt) tumour and MDM2-p53 antagonists offer a novel therapeutic strategy for neuroblastoma patients. RG7388 (Roche) is currently undergoing early phase clinical evaluation in adults. This study assessed the efficacy of RG7388 as a single-agent and in combination with chemotherapies currently used to treat neuroblastoma in a panel of neuroblastoma cell lines. RG7388 GI50 concentrations were determined in 21 p53-wt and mutant neuroblastoma cell lines of varying MYCN, MDM2 and p14(ARF) status, together with MYCN-regulatable Tet21N cells. The primary determinant of response was the presence of wt p53, and overall there was a >200-fold difference in RG7388 GI50 concentrations for p53-wt versus mutant cell lines. Tet21N MYCN+ cells were significantly more sensitive to RG7388 compared with MYCN- cells. Using median-effect analysis in 5 p53-wt neuroblastoma cell lines, selected combinations of RG7388 with cisplatin, doxorubicin, topotecan, temozolomide and busulfan were synergistic. Furthermore, combination treatments led to increased apoptosis, as evident by higher caspase-3/7 activity compared to either agent alone. These data show that RG7388 is highly potent against p53-wt neuroblastoma cells, and strongly supports its further evaluation as a novel therapy for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma and wt p53 to potentially improve survival and/or reduce toxicity.
26366217	The Expression and Function of NUMB in Endometrial Cancer and the Interaction with HDM2 and P53.	Wang C, Feng W, Zhang C.	BACKGROUND: Since more and more evidences support that NUMB orchestrates many cell physiological and pathological processes of diseases including cancer, based on our previous work, we studied deeply the function of NUMB in endometrial cancer (EC) and tried to understand the mechanism of NUMB's nucleus translocation which might be relative to the occurrence of EC and will contribute to find a new targeting therapeutic strategy for EC. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was employed to test NUMB and HDM2 expression in endometrial cancer tissue from clinical patients. CCK-8 assay, cell cycle tested by Flow cytometer and PCNA determined by RT-PCR were employed to test the effects of NUMB on cell proliferation and apoptosis. In order to investigate the mechanism how NUMB, HDM2 and p53 interact in EC cell, western blot, Co-IP and immunofluorescent were used to observe the combination and location of NUMB, HDM2 and p53 as well as the interaction among them. RESULTS: Both NUMB and HDM2 expressed greater in endometrial cancer tissues than in normal endometrial tissues. Overexpression of NUMB induced apoptosis in Ishikawa cell while inhibition of NUMB increased cell proliferation. NUMB could combine HDM2 and p53, moreover the PTB domain of NUMB is the main site combining with p53. The effects of NUMB in cell was closely associated with p53. Not only NUMB regulated P53 expression level but also NUMB acts depending on P53, in turn p53 impacted the NUMB level as a feedback. Overexpression of NUMB could not bring itself into nuclear. Both siHDM2 and siP53 didn't bring NUMB into nucleus, However overexpression of HDM2 and p53 increased the NUMB level in nucleus, and the NUMB nuclear location induced by overexpression of HDM2 was stronger than that of p53 overexpression. CONCLUSIONS: Based on present data, we think NUMB acts as an anti-oncogene role and could regulate p53 level and function in endometrial cancer like in other cancers, meanwhile, the function of NUMB depend on P53. On the other hand, the location of NUMB could be regulated mainly by HDM2. So far we are not able to explain why endometrial cancer patients had high NUMB expression level since NUMB was regarded as a tumor suppressor, which is worthy studying further to explore underlying mechanism.
26391003	Study of antitumor effect of selected vanadium and molybdenum organometallic complexes in human leukemic T-cells.	Šebestová L, Havelek R, Řezáčová M, Honzíček J, Kročová Z, Vinklárek J.	This work describes cytotoxic effect of non-platinum metal-based compounds on the human T-leukemic cells with different p53 status (p53 wild-type MOLT-4 and p53-deficient Jurkat cells). The cytotoxic and apoptosis-inducing effect of the vanadium complex [(η(5)-C5H5)2V(5-NH2-phen)]OTf (V1) and molybdenum complex [(η(3)-C3H5)Mo(CO)2(phen)Cl] (Mo1) were studied using flow cytometry, spectrophotometry and Western blotting. We found that the cytotoxic effect of both tested complexes after 24 h is higher against the both examined cell lines than that of cis-platin (cis-DDP). At later investigated time intervals of 48 and 72 h, the cytotoxic effect of the cis-DDP increased but the values of the cytotoxicity of the tested V1 and Mo1 complexes remained unchanged, with the cytotoxicity of V1 comparable to that of cis-DDP. Furthermore we observed that the apoptotic process was induced by the activation of the caspases 9 (intrinsic pathway) and 8 (extrinsic pathway) in cells exposed to evaluated complexes. In case of the p53 wild-type MOLT-4 cells, the expression of the tumor-suppressor protein p53 and its form phosphorylated at the serine 15 increased after both V1 and Mo1 treatment, similar to the effect of cis-DDP.
26232180	NR2B-dependent cyclophilin D translocation suppresses the recovery of synaptic transmission after oxygen-glucose deprivation.	Zhang Z, Wang Y, Yan S, Du F, Yan SS.	N-methyl d-aspartate receptor (NMDA) subunit 2B (NR2B)-containing NMDA receptors and mitochondrial protein cyclophilin D (CypD) are well characterized in mediating neuronal death after ischemia, respectively. However, whether and how NR2B and CypD work together in mediating synaptic injury after ischemia remains elusive. Using an ex vivo ischemia model of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in hippocampal slices, we identified a NR2B-dependent mechanism for CypD translocation onto the mitochondrial inner membrane. CypD depletion (CypD null mice) prevented OGD-induced impairment in synaptic transmission recovery. Overexpression of neuronal CypD mice (CypD+) exacerbated OGD-induced loss of synaptic transmission. Inhibition of CypD-dependent mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening by cyclosporine A (CSA) attenuated ischemia-induced synaptic perturbation in CypD+ and non-transgenic (non-Tg) mice. The treatment of antioxidant EUK134 to suppress mitochondrial oxidative stress rescued CypD-mediated synaptic dysfunction following OGD in CypD+ slices. Furthermore, OGD provoked the interaction of CypD with P53, which was enhanced in slices overexpressing CypD but was diminished in CypD-null slices. Inhibition of p53 using a specific inhibitor of p53 (pifithrin-μ) attenuated the CypD/p53 interaction following OGD, along with a restored synaptic transmission in both non-Tg and CypD+ hippocampal slices. Our results indicate that OGD-induced CypD translocation potentiates CypD/P53 interaction in a NR2B dependent manner, promoting oxidative stress and loss of synaptic transmission. We also evaluate a new ex vivo chronic OGD-induced ischemia model for studying the effect of oxidative stress on synaptic damage.
26359229	Modulation of cyclins and p53 in mesangial cell proliferation and apoptosis during Habu nephritis.	Lu Y, Wen J, Chen D, Wu L, Li Q, Xie Y, Wu D, Liu X, Chen X.	BACKGROUND: Mesangial cell (MC) proliferation and apoptosis are the main pathological changes observed in mesangial proliferative nephritis. In this study, we explored the role of cyclins and p53 in modulating MC proliferation and apoptosis in a mouse model of Habu nephritis. METHODS: The Habu nephritis group was prepared by injection of Habu toxin. Mesangiolysis and mesangial expansion were determined by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reagent staining. Immunohistochemical analysis of PCNA and KI67, and TUNEL staining were used to detect cell proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. Expression levels of cyclins and p53 were examined by Western blotting. RESULTS: PAS staining showed that mesangial dissolution appeared on days 1 and 3, and mesangial proliferation with extracellular matrix accumulation was apparent by days 7 and 14. Both PCNA and KI67 immunohistochemical analysis showed that MC proliferation began on day 3, peaked on day 3 and 7, and recovered by day 14. TUNEL staining results showed that MC apoptosis began to increase on day 1, continued to rise on day 7, and peaked on day 14. Western blot analysis showed that cyclin D1 was upregulated on day 1, cyclins A2 and E were upregulated on days 3 and 7, and p53 was upregulated on days 3, 7 and 14. There was no change in the expression levels of Bax or p21. CONCLUSION: We explored the tendency for MC proliferation and apoptosis during the process of Habu nephritis and found that cyclins and p53 may modulate the disease pathology. This will help us determine the molecular pathogenesis of MC proliferation and provide new targets for disease intervention.
26404687	[Predictive value of P53, Ki-67, HER2 protein detection in neoadjuvant chemotherapy for adenocarcinoma of gastroesophageal junction].	Li S, Li J, Liu Z, Zhang Z, Zhang W, Yang H, Li B.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the predictive value of P53, Ki-67, HER2 protein detection in neoadjuvant chemotherapy for adenocarcinoma of gastroesophageal junction(AGEJ). METHODS: Preoperative biopsy specimens and clinical data of 72 patients of locally advanced Siewert II( AGEJ between June 2010 and December 2013 were reviewed. All the patients received SOX scheme neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and were divided into effective group(complete response plus partial response) and ineffective group(stable disease plus progressive disease). Expressions of above 3 proteins were detected by immunohistochemistry in all the patients before neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The relationship between various proteins and efficacy of chemotherapy was analyzed by univariate and logistic multivariate regression analyses. RESULTS: All the 72 patients successfully completed 2 cycles of SOX neoadjuvant chemotherapy, among them, 5 cases(6.9%) with complete response, 30 cases (41.7%) with partial response, 31 cases(43.1%) with stable disease, 6 cases(8.3%) with progressive disease, including 35 cases in effective group and 37 cases in ineffective group. Compared with ineffective group, the positive expression rate of P53 was significantly reduced(25.0% vs. 45.9%, P=0.020), and that of Ki-67 significantly increased (77.1% vs. 43.2%, P=0.003), however, there was no significant difference in the expression rate of HER2 between the two groups(P>0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that Ki-67 was the independent predictive factor for the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P=0.015). Spearman rank correlation showed that Ki-67 expression was positively correlated with HER2 expression (r=0.259, P=0.028), but P53 expression was not correlated with Ki-67 or HER2 (r=0.140, 0.042, P=0.240, 0.725, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: SOX neoadjuvant chemotherapy is safe and effective for AGEJ, especially for patients with depressed expression of P53 and elevated expression of Ki-67, which both may be used as reference for the prediction of chemotherapy efficacy. There is no correlation between P53 and Ki67 proteins, so combined detection may improve the predictive value.
25104286	Mapping p53 mutations in low-grade glioma: a voxel-based neuroimaging analysis.	Wang YY, Zhang T, Li SW, Qian TY, Fan X, Peng XX, Ma J, Wang L, Jiang T.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Brain tumor location has proved to be a prognostic factor that may be associated with features of neoplastic origin. Mutation of p53 is an atypical genetic change that occurs during tumorigenesis. Thus, a potential correlation may exist between tumor location and p53 status. The purpose of the current study was to identify anatomic characteristics of mutant p53 expression by using quantitative neuroimaging analyses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Preoperative MR images from 182 patients with histologically confirmed low-grade gliomas were retrospectively analyzed. All tumors were manually marked and registered to the standard space. Using a voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping analysis, we located brain regions associated with a high occurrence of p53 mutation and corrected them by using a permutation test. The acquired clusters were further included as a factor in survival analyses. RESULTS: Statistical analysis demonstrated that the left medial temporal lobe and right anterior temporal lobe were specifically associated with high expression of mutant p53. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that tumors located in these regions were associated with significantly worse progression-free survival compared with tumors occurring elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: Our voxel-level imaging analysis provides new evidence that genetic changes during cancer may have anatomic specificity. Additionally, the current study suggests that tumor location identified on structural MR images could potentially be used for customized presurgical outcome prediction.
25871794	Nutlin-3 down-regulates retinoblastoma protein expression and inhibits muscle cell differentiation.	Walsh EM, Niu M, Bergholz J, Xiao ZX.	The p53 tumor suppressor gene plays a critical role in regulation of proliferation, cell death and differentiation. The MDM2 oncoprotein is a major negative regulator for p53 by binding to and targeting p53 for proteasome-mediated degradation. The small molecule inhibitor, nutlin-3, disrupts MDM2-p53 interaction resulting in stabilization and activation of p53 protein. We have previously shown that nutlin-3 activates p53, leading to MDM2 accumulation as concomitant of reduced retinoblastoma (Rb) protein stability. It is well known that Rb is important in muscle development and myoblast differentiation and that rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), or cancer of the skeletal muscle, typically harbors MDM2 amplification. In this study, we show that nutlin-3 inhibited myoblast proliferation and effectively prevented myoblast differentiation, as evidenced by lack of expression of muscle differentiation markers including myogenin and myosin heavy chain (MyHC), as well as a failure to form multinucleated myotubes, which were associated with dramatic increases in MDM2 expression and decrease in Rb protein levels. These results indicate that nutlin-3 can effectively inhibit muscle cell differentiation.
25952326	Resveratrol induces DNA damage in colon cancer cells by poisoning topoisomerase II and activates the ATM kinase to trigger p53-dependent apoptosis.	Demoulin B, Hermant M, Castrogiovanni C, Staudt C, Dumont P.	Resveratrol (trans-3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene) is a natural polyphenol synthesized by various plants such as grape vine. Resveratrol (RSV) is a widely studied molecule, largely for its chemopreventive effect in different mouse cancer models. We propose a mechanism underlying the cytotoxic activity of RSV on colon cancer cells. Our data show that resveratrol induces apoptosis, as observed by the cleavage of PARP-1 and chromatin condensation. We show that the tumor suppressor p53 is activated in response to RSV and participates to the apoptotic process. Additionally, we show that HCT-116 p53 wt colon carcinoma cells are significantly more sensitive than HCT-116 p53-/- cells to RSV. RSV induces DNA damage including double strand breaks, as evidenced by the presence of multiple γ-H2AX foci in 50% of cells after a 24 h treatment with 25 μM RSV. The formation of DNA damage does not appear to rely on a pro-oxidant effect of the molecule, inhibition of topoisomerase I, or DNA intercalation. Rather, we show that DNA damage is the consequence of type II topoisomerase poisoning. Exposure of HCT-116 cells to RSV leads to activation of the Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) kinase, and ATM is required to activate p53.
25966200	Correlation between p53 and epidermal growth factor receptor expression in breast cancer classification.	Wang XZ, Liu Q, Sun JJ, Zuo WS, Hu DW, Ma SG, Mu DB, Yu ZY.	This study aimed to explore new opportunities for developing targeted therapy for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) by analyzing the significance and association between p53 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression in different molecular subtypes of breast cancer. The clinical and pathological data of 264 patients with breast cancer receiving surgery in our hospital from January 2012 to August 2013 were retrospectively analyzed. According to the expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), Ki-67, CK5/6, p53, and EGFR detected by immunohistochemical methods, breast cancer was divided into four molecular subtypes. Then, the expression of p53 and EGFR as well as their correlation in the different subtypes were determined. Among the four subtypes, luminal B breast cancer was the most common type. TNBC and HER2-enriched breast cancer had larger tumor sizes with higher expression of Ki-67 as compared with the luminal types. TNBC had a lower lymph node metastasis rate but higher CK5/6 and EGFR expression than the other three types. The expression of p53 was higher in luminal B, HER2-enriched, and triple-negative breast cancers, and this was positively correlated with the expression of EGFR in TNBC but not in the other subtypes. p53 and EGFR expression was positively correlated in TNBC, which enables us to explore the molecular biological characteristics of TNBC, so as to provide new ideas for the treatment of TNBC.
25979255	Clinicopathological correlates of extrasellar growth patterns in pituitary adenomas.	Sarkar S, Chacko AG, Chacko G.	We reviewed clinical, imaging and histopathology details of 297 patients who underwent surgery for pituitary adenomas, with an equal distribution of functional and non-functioning tumors, to examine clinicopathological correlates of extrasellar growth. Knosp grades of 3 and 4 on MRI defined cavernous sinus invasion, Hardy grades of C and D defined significant suprasellar/subfrontal extension, and intraoperative evidence of tumor eroding through the clivus or sellar floor defined infrasellar invasion. Disease status at follow-up was known in 246 patients overall, including 35 patients who were evaluated for progression of residual disease on serial imaging. On univariate analysis, we found several statistically significant associations (p < 0.05) including adenoma size with age, sex and tumor protein p53 reactivity; cavernous sinus invasion with size, non-functional status, increased mitotic activity, an elevated MIB-1 proliferation index and p53 reactivity; suprasellar/subfrontal extension with p53 reactivity; and infrasellar invasion with age and tumor size. When adjusting for confounders with logistic regression, several significant associations were evident including adenoma size with male sex and p53 reactivity; cavernous sinus invasion with size and elevated MIB-1 proliferation index; suprasellar/subfrontal extension with p53 reactivity; and infrasellar invasion with adenoma size alone. Patients with early progression of postoperative residual tumor were younger with a non-significant trend towards higher MIB-1 proliferation indices. Individual patterns of extrasellar growth in pituitary adenomas are associated with unique clinical and immunohistochemical profiles. Younger patients with elevated MIB-1 values are probably at high risk for early recurrence of non-functioning tumors. Definitions of atypia must be standardized before more robust assumptions about tumor biology can be established.
25979650	Expression of cell cycle regulators, 14-3-3σ and p53 proteins, and vimentin in canine transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder.	Suárez-Bonnet A, Herráez P, Aguirre M, Suárez-Bonnet E, Andrada M, Rodríguez F, Espinosa de Los Monteros A.	OBJECTIVES: The study of the expression of 14-3-3σ, p53, and vimentin proteins in canine transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) evaluating differences with normal bladder tissues, and the association with clinicopathological variables. METHODS: We analyze by immunohistochemistry in 19 canine TCCs the expression of 14-3-3σ, p53, and vimentin using monoclonal antibodys. A semiquantitative scoring method was employed and statistical analysis was performed to display relationships between variables. RESULTS: In contrast to normal urinary bladder epithelium, which showed high levels of 14-3-3σ, its expression was decreased in 53% of the studied tumors (P = 0.0344). The 14-3-3σ protein was expressed by neoplastic emboli and by highly infiltrative neoplastic cells. The p53 protein was expressed in 26% of TCCs, but no significant association between 14-3-3σ and p53 was detected. Neoplastic epithelial cells displayed vimentin immunoreactivity in 21% of TCCs, and a positive correlation with mitotic index was observed (P = 0.042). Coexpression of vimentin and 14-3-3σ by highly infiltrative neoplastic cells was also observed. CONCLUSIONS: 14-3-3σ is deregulated in canine TCCs and its expression by highly infiltrative tumor cells may be related to the acquisition of aggressive behavior. Furthermore, this article reinforce the role of canine TCC as relevant model of human urothelial carcinoma and we suggest 14-3-3σ as a potential therapeutic target. Further studies are necessary to clarify the role of 14-3-3σ in canine TCC.
25981657	[A case of primary testicular diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with a p53 gene point mutation].	Usami M, Kuroda H, Shimoyama S, Yoshida M, Yamada M, Abe T, Sakurai T, Fujii S, Maeda M, Wakabayashi Y, Tsukamoto K, Fujita M, Kanari Y, Takada K, Kato J.	A 52-year-old man with bilateral swelling in the scrotum was referred to the department of urology in our hospital in January 2013. Pathological examination of the scrotum revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma(DLBCL). Immunohistochemical staining revealed p53 overexpression, and polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism(PCRSSCP) revealed a point mutation in exon 7 of the p53 gene. Rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine, and prednisolone(R-CHOP)therapy and intrathecal prophylaxis were initiated. After three courses of R-CHOP therapy, high-dose cytarabine was administered, followed by peripheral blood stem cell harvesting. Busulfan, etoposide, and Ara-C(BEA)therapy was then administered, followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation(auto- PBSCT). Primary testicular lymphoma(PTL)is a rare, clinically aggressive form of extranodal lymphoma, and there is a high incidence rate of relapse in the central nervous system(CNS). The vast majority of cases are histologically DLBCL. The p53 mutation is an independent marker of poor prognosis in patients with DLBCL treated with R-CHOP therapy. Our patient has been disease free for 17 months after auto-PBSCT with high-dose chemotherapy, which results in a greater level of penetration into the CNS.
26011351	Expression of FHIT, p16, p53 and EGFR as prognostic markers in thyroid tumors of uncertain malignant potential.	Koc M, Aktimur R, Kagan Gokakin A, Atabey M, Koyuncu A, Elagoz S, Topcu O.	PURPOSE: Thyroid tumors of uncertain malignant potential (TT-UMP) constitute a relatively new diagnosis. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between immunohistochemical panels, prognostic parameters and TT-UMP. METHODS: Group I was composed of patients diagnosed as differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) and Group II of patients diagnosed as TT-UMP. The prognostic scores of patients were calculated using data according to the well-known prognostic scoring systems MACIS, AMES, AGES. Evaluations of antibodies were based on the presence of nuclear staining for p16 and p53, membranous and cytoplasmic staining for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and cytoplasmic staining for fragile histidine triad (FHIT). RESULTS: Statistically significant difference was noted (p< 0.05) between Group I and Group II according to MACIS and AMES. No statistical difference was found in terms of immunostaining between groups when stained with p16, p53 and FHIT. On the other hand, in Group II a moderate positive correlation was detected between MACIS and EGFR. CONCLUSION: According to our findings p53 was not important in tumor genesis at early stages in well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas and p16 loss of expression could be used as a finding to help in difficult microscopic diagnosis. TT-UMP is a gray zone of lesions requiring specific therapeutic procedures and postoperative follow-up. A positive correlation was detected between EGFR and TT-UMP, leading to assume that this situation could be used as a new tool in the follow-up of these patients in the future.
26055805	Reverse chemomodulatory effects of the SIRT1 activators resveratrol and SRT1720 in Ewing's sarcoma cells: resveratrol suppresses and SRT1720 enhances etoposide- and vincristine-induced anticancer activity.	Sonnemann J, Kahl M, Siranjeevi PM, Blumrich A, Blümel L, Becker S, Wittig S, Winkler R, Krämer OH, Beck JF.	PURPOSE: SIRT1-activating compounds (STACs) may have potential in the management of cancer. However, the best-studied STAC, the naturally occurring compound resveratrol, is reported to have contradictory effects in combination chemotherapy regimens: It has been shown both to increase and to decrease the action of anticancer agents. To shed more light on this issue, we comparatively investigated the impact of resveratrol and the synthetic STAC SRT1720 on the responsiveness of Ewing's sarcoma (ES) cells to the chemotherapeutic drugs etoposide and vincristine. METHODS: Because the effects of STACs can depend on the functionality of the tumor suppressor protein p53, we used three ES cell lines differing in their p53 status, i.e., wild-type p53 WE-68 cells, mutant p53 SK-ES-1 cells and p53 null SK-N-MC cells. Single agent and combination therapy effects were assessed by flow cytometric analyses of propidium iodide uptake and mitochondrial depolarization, by measuring caspase 3/7 activity and by gene expression profiling. RESULTS: When applied as single agents, both STACs were effective in ES cells irrespective of their p53 status. Strikingly, however, when applied in conjunction with cytostatic agents, the STACs displayed reverse effects: SRT1720 largely enhanced etoposide- and vincristine-induced cell death, while resveratrol inhibited it. Combination index analyses validated the antipodal impact of the STACs on the effectiveness of the chemotherapeutics. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the synthetic STAC SRT1720 may be useful to enhance the efficacy of anticancer therapy in ES. But they also suggest that the dietary intake of the natural STAC resveratrol may be detrimental during chemotherapy of ES.
26063242	Overexpression of p53 predicts colorectal neoplasia risk in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and mucosa changes indefinite for dysplasia.	Horvath B, Liu G, Wu X, Lai KK, Shen B, Liu X.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We previously demonstrated a significant colorectal neoplasia risk in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with mucosal changes indefinite for dysplasia (IND) and the potential diagnostic utility of p53 and cytokeratin 7 immunohistochemistry in IBD-associated neoplasia. The primary aim of this exploratory study was to determine the predictive value of the two markers for neoplasia risk in the IBD-IND population. METHODS: We identified 44 eligible cases with IBD and IND in colon biopsy from our pathology database. We semi-quantified the expression of p53 and cytokeratin 7 in the colon biopsies by immunohistochemistry and correlated their expression, demographic information, and clinical features with colorectal neoplasia outcome. RESULTS: The mean age of the cohort was 46.6 ± 15.1 years, with 25 (56.8%) being male. The median follow-up was 101 months (range: 6-247) after IND diagnosis. Among these 44 patients, 11 (25%) progressed to neoplasia (low-grade dysplasia = 6; high-grade dysplasia = 2; cancer 3) at a median follow-up of 66 months (range: 19-145). Univariate analysis demonstrated that age and p53 overexpression were associated with progression to neoplasia. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-five percent of patients with IBD and IND developed colorectal dysplasia or cancer. Overexpression of p53 and age are associated with neoplastic progression.
26086967	APR-246 overcomes resistance to cisplatin and doxorubicin in ovarian cancer cells.	Mohell N, Alfredsson J, Fransson Å, Uustalu M, Byström S, Gullbo J, Hallberg A, Bykov VJ, Björklund U, Wiman KG.	Two main causes of platinum resistance are mutation in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 and drug-induced increase in intracellular glutathione concentration. Mutations in TP53 occur in about 50% of human tumors. APR-246 (PRIMA-1(MET)) is the first clinical-stage compound that reactivates mutant p53 and induces apoptosis. APR-246 is a prodrug that is converted to the active compound methylene quinuclidinone (MQ), a Michael acceptor that binds to cysteine residues in mutant p53 and restores its wild-type conformation. Here, we show that MQ also binds to cysteine in glutathione, thus decreasing intracellular free glutathione concentration. We also show that treatment with APR-246 completely restores the cisplatin and doxorubicin sensitivity to p53-mutant drug-resistant ovarian cancer cells. We propose that this unique ability of APR-246/MQ to bind to cysteines in both mutant p53 and glutathione has a key role in the resensitization as well as in the outstanding synergistic effects observed with APR-246 in combination with platinum compounds in ovarian cancer cell lines and primary cancer cells. However, MQ binding to cysteines in other targets, for example, thioredoxin reductase, may contribute as well. Strong synergy was also observed with the DNA-damaging drugs doxorubicin and gemcitabine, while additive effects were found with the taxane docetaxel. Our results provide a strong rationale for the ongoing clinical study with APR-246 in combination with platinum-based therapy in patients with p53-mutant recurrent high-grade serous (HGS) ovarian cancer. More than 96% of these patients carry TP53 mutations. Combined treatment with APR-246 and platinum or other DNA-damaging drugs could allow dramatically improved therapy of a wide range of therapy refractory p53 mutant tumors.
25304379	Chaetoglobosin K induces apoptosis and G2 cell cycle arrest through p53-dependent pathway in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells.	Li B, Gao Y, Rankin GO, Rojanasakul Y, Cutler SJ, Tu Y, Chen YC.	Adverse side effects and acquired resistance to conventional platinum based chemotherapy have become major impediments in ovarian cancer treatment, and drive the development of more selective anticancer drugs. Chaetoglobosin K (ChK) was shown to have a more potent growth inhibitory effect than cisplatin on two cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines, OVCAR-3 and A2780/CP70, and was less cytotoxic to a normal ovarian cell line, IOSE-364, than to the cancer cell lines. Hoechst 33342 staining and Flow cytometry analysis indicated that ChK induced preferential apoptosis and G2 cell cycle arrest in both ovarian cancer cells with respect to the normal ovarian cells. ChK induced apoptosis through a p53-dependent caspase-8 activation extrinsic pathway, and caused G2 cell cycle arrest via cyclin B1 by increasing p53 expression and p38 phosphorylation in OVCAR-3 and A2780/CP70 cells. DR5 and p21 might play an important role in determining the sensitivity of normal and malignant ovarian cells to ChK. Based on these results, ChK would be a potential compound for treating platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
25333296	Icariside II inhibits cell proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest through the ROS-p38-p53 signaling pathway in A375 human melanoma cells.	Wu J, Song T, Liu S, Li X, Li G, Xu J.	Icariside II (IS) is a metabolite of icariin, which is derived from Herba Epimedii. In the present study, the antiproliferative effects of IS on A375 human melanoma cells were examined in vitro and a possible mechanism through the ROS-p38-p53 pathway is discussed. A cell WST-8 assay revealed that treatment with IS markedly reduced cell viability from 77 to 21% (25 and 100 µM, respectively), and cell counting demonstrated that IS treatment reduced cell proliferation. IS treatment also induced cell cycle arrest of A375 cells at the G0/G1 and G2/M transitions and inhibited the expression of cell-cycle related proteins, including cyclin E, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), cyclin B1 and phosphorylated cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (P-CDK1). In this study, it was determined that IS inhibits cell proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest through the generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of p38 and p53. These findings were further supported by the evidence that pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine, SB203580 or pifithrin-α significantly blocked IS-induced reduction of cell viability, increase of cell death and cell cycle arrest. In conclusion, IS inhibits cell proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest. Crucially, it was confirmed that these effects were mediated at least in part by activating the ROS-p38-p53 pathway.
25502079	The preliminary study of p53 codon 72 polymorphism and risk of cervical carcinoma in Gabonese women.	Assoumou SZ, Boumba AL, Ndjoyi-Mbiguino A, Khattabi A, Ennaji MM.	Cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in Africa and the first most common cancer in Gabonese women due to infection of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV). However, other cofactors such as genetic factors also come into play. A common polymorphism of the p53 codon 72 in exon 4 with two alleles encoding arginine or proline is known at this locus. The homozygous arginine form of this polymorphism has been associated with the development of cervical cancer as an increased genetic risk factor. However, the results are still controversial. This study aims to investigate whether the genotype distribution of p53 codon 72 may be a risk factor for cervical cancer among Gabonese women. Samples from 102 Gabonese women, 31 diagnosed with cervical cancer and 71 healthy controls, were used. HPV detection was done by nested PCR with MY09/11 and GP5+/6+ primers followed by sequencing for HPV genotyping. p53 codon 72 polymorphism determination was performed by allele-specific PCR assay. Viral DNA was detected in 87.1 % of cases and in 54.93 % of control. HPV 16 was the most predominant in cancer and controls cases. The distribution of Arg/Arg, Arg/Pro and Pro/Pro genotypes was 35.5, 51.6 and 12.9 % in the cervical cancer group and 22.5, 62 and 15.5 % in the control group. No significant association was found between polymorphism of p53 itself as well as in combination with HPV16/18 infection and risk of development of cervical cancer among Gabonese women. Thus, the polymorphism of p53 codon 72 in exon 4 does not seem to play a role in the development of cervical cancer among Gabonese women.
25514878	Clinicopathological and immunohistochemical characteristics of surgically treated primary carcinoma of the nasal vestibule - an evaluation of 30 cases.	Koopmann M, Weiss D, Savvas E, Rudack C, Stenner M.	OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Squamous cell carcinoma of the nasal vestibule (SCCNV) is a rare tumour entity. Treatment modality, particularly indication of neck dissection, is still a controversial subject of debate. We sought to evaluate the occurrence of lymph node metastases, the prognosis and the immunohistochemical characteristics of SCCNV. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: This study included 30 consecutive patients with SCCNV treated with primary tumour resection and neck dissection in cases of suspicious lymph nodes between 2003 and 2013. According to therapeutical standard adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy were applied in some cases. Clinicopathological data and immunohistochemical expression of CK5/6, EGFR, Ki-67, MMP-2, MMP-9, p53 and VEGFR were analysed. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 47.1 months. Five-year disease-free (5-year DFS) and 5-year overall survival (5-year OS) were 91.7% and 92.3%. Five-year OS in low-grade tumours (G1, G2) was 100.0%, in high-grade tumours (G3) 75.0% (P = 0.028), respectively. We did not detect any lymph node metastases in the neck dissections. Overexpression of p53 showed a trend for better 5-year OS (p53-positive 100% versus p53-negative 77.8%, n.s.). We found a positive correlation between p53 and EGFR (P = 0.0001). There was no significant relationship between the expression rates of the markers and tumour stage and grading. CONCLUSIONS: We propose no prophylactic neck dissection in small-sized SCCNV. Subtile endoscopic follow-up and periodic ultrasound examination of the cervical lymph nodes after surgical treatment are recommended. Further evaluation of the p53- and EGFR-pathways might pave the way to identify possible molecular targets in an attempt to tailor tumour management.
25499817	Porcine parvovirus infection induces apoptosis in PK-15 cells through activation of p53 and mitochondria-mediated pathway.	Zhang H, Huang Y, Du Q, Luo X, Zhang L, Zhao X, Tong D.	Porcine parvovirus (PPV) infection has been reported to induce the cytopathic effects (CPE) in some special host cells and contribute the occurrence of porcine parvovirus disease, but the molecular mechanisms underlying PPV-induced CPE are not clear. In this study, we investigated the morphological and molecular changes of porcine kidney cell line (PK-15 cells) infected with PPV. The results showed that PPV infection inhibited the viability of PK-15 cells in a time and concentration dependent manner. PPV infection induced typical apoptotic features including chromatin condensation, apoptotic body formation, nuclear fragmentation, and Annexin V-binding activity. Further studies showed that Bax was increased and translocated to mitochondria, whereas Bcl-2 was decreased in PPV-infected cells, which caused mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization, resulting in the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, followed by caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation. However, the expression of Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) did not appear significant changes in the process of PPV-induced apoptosis. Moreover, PPV infection activated p53 signaling, which was involved in the activation of apoptotic signaling induced by PPV infection via regulation of Bax and Bcl-2. Taken together, our results demonstrated that PPV infection induced apoptosis in PK-15 cells through activation of p53 and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway. This study may contribute to shed light on the molecular pathogenesis of PPV infection.
25573381	Effective targeting of the P53-MDM2 axis in preclinical models of infant MLL-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Richmond J, Carol H, Evans K, High L, Mendomo A, Robbins A, Meyer C, Venn NC, Marschalek R, Henderson M, Sutton R, Kurmasheva RT, Kees UR, Houghton PJ, Smith MA, Lock RB.	PURPOSE: Although the overall cure rate for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) approaches 90%, infants with ALL harboring translocations in the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) oncogene (infant MLL-ALL) experience shorter remission duration and lower survival rates (∼50%). Mutations in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene are uncommon in infant MLL-ALL, and drugs that release p53 from inhibitory mechanisms may be beneficial. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of the orally available nutlin, RG7112, against patient-derived MLL-ALL xenografts. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Eight MLL-ALL patient-derived xenografts were established in immune-deficient mice, and their molecular features compared with B-lineage ALL and T-ALL xenografts. The sensitivity of MLL-ALL xenografts to RG7112 was assessed in vitro and in vivo, and the ability of RG7112 to induce p53, cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis in vivo was evaluated. RESULTS: Gene-expression analysis revealed that MLL-ALL, B-lineage ALL, and T-ALL xenografts clustered according to subtype. Moreover, genes previously reported to be overexpressed in MLL-ALL, including MEIS1, CCNA1, and members of the HOXA family, were significantly upregulated in MLL-ALL xenografts, confirming their ability to recapitulate the clinical disease. Exposure of MLL-ALL xenografts to RG7112 in vivo caused p53 upregulation, cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis. RG7112 as a single agent induced significant regressions in infant MLL-ALL xenografts. Therapeutic enhancement was observed when RG7112 was assessed using combination treatment with an induction-type regimen (vincristine/dexamethasone/L-asparaginase) against an MLL-ALL xenograft. CONCLUSIONS: The utility of targeting the p53-MDM2 axis in combination with established drugs for the management of infant MLL-ALL warrants further investigation.
25581503	The large conductance calcium-activated potassium channel affects extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms of apoptosis.	Sakai Y, Sokolowski B.	The large-conductance calcium-activated K(+) or BK channel underlies electrical signals in a number of different cell types. Studies show that BK activity can also serve to regulate cellular homeostasis by protecting cells from apoptosis resulting from events such as ischemia. Recent coimmunoprecipitation studies, combined with mass spectrometry, suggest putative protein partners that interact with BK to regulate intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. This study tests two of those partners to determine the effects on these two signaling pathways. Through reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation (coIP) experiments, we show that BK interacts with p53 and fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) in mouse brain and when overexpressed in a heterologous expression system, such as HEK293 cells. Moreover, coIP experiments with N- and C-terminal fragments reveal that FADD interacts with the C-terminus of BK, whereas p53 interacts with either the N- or the C-terminus. Immunolocalization studies show that BK colocalizes with p53 and FADD in the mitochondrion and plasmalemma, respectively. HEK cells that stably express BK are more resistant to apoptosis when p53 or FADD is overexpressed or when their intrinsic and extrinsic pathways are stimulated via mitomycin C or tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), respectively. Moreover, when stimulating with TRAIL, caspase-8 activation decreases in BK-expressing cells. These data suggest that BK is part of a larger complex of proteins that protects against apoptosis by interacting with proapoptotic proteins, such as p53 and FADD.
25640025	Features of extramedullary disease of multiple myeloma: high frequency of p53 deletion and poor survival: a retrospective single-center study of 834 cases.	Deng S, Xu Y, An G, Sui W, Zou D, Zhao Y, Qi J, Li F, Hao M, Qiu L.	BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a heterogeneous disease in which most patients have myeloma restricted to the bone marrow, and some patients develop extramedullary disease (EMD) at the time of diagnosis or during follow-up, and show different clinical characteristics and a dismal prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 834 consecutive MM patients in a single center in China and compared clinical features of patients with and without EMD. RESULTS: In general, the prevalence of EMD was 4.8% at the time of diagnosis and 3.4% during follow-up, with a significant increase in recent years. MM patients with EMD at the time of diagnosis had remarkably greater prevalence of P53 deletion determined using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis (34.5% vs. 11.9%; P = .037) and higher level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (P = .003) compared with patients without EMD. EMD relapse/progression during follow-up was correlated with EMD presentation at diagnosis, immunoglobulin (Ig)D subtype and P53 deletion in FISH analysis, but not previous treatment (thalidomide, bortizomib, or transplantation). With respect to prognosis, multivariate analysis showed that EMD was an independent adverse prognostic factor. The overall survival of patients with and without EMD at diagnosis were 16.5 and 40 months, respectively (P < .001), and the time to disease progression of the 2 groups was 11.5 and 25 months, respectively (P < .001). CONCLUSION: MM patients with EMD at the time of diagnosis showed remarkably greater prevalence of P53 deletion in FISH analysis and higher LDH levels. EMD relapse/progression was correlated with EMD presentation at diagnosis, IgD subtype, and P53 deletion in FISH analysis, but not previous exposure to new drugs or transplantation. The presence of EMD involvement negatively affected survival.
25649747	Induction of α-phellandrene on autophagy in human liver tumor cells.	Hsieh LC, Hsieh SL, Chen CT, Chung JG, Wang JJ, Wu CC.	α-Phellandrene (α-PA) is a cyclic monoterpene. To investigate the induction of autophagy by α-PA and its mechanism, human liver tumor cells (J5) were incubated with α-PA and analyzed for cell viability and the molecular regulation of pre-autophagosome origination and autophagosome formation. According to the results, PI3K-I, mTOR, and Akt protein levels were decreased after α-PA treatment compared to those of the control group (p < 0.05). The phosphorylation of Bcl-2, and PI3K-III, LC3-II and Beclin-1 protein levels in J5 cells were increased after α-PA treatment (p < 0.05). In addition, α-PA up-regulated nuclear p53 and down-regulated cytoplasmic p53 expression in J5 cells. The NF-κB pathway was activated, as indicated by increase in cytosolic phosphorylated IκB, nuclear NF-κB levels, and the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB after α-PA treatment in J5 cells (p < 0.05). These results suggest that α-PA can induce J5 cell autophagy by regulating mTOR and LC-3II expression, p53 signaling, and NF-κB activation in J5 cells.
25657069	p53 expression in breast cancer predicts tumors with low probability of non-sentinel nodes infiltration.	Vernet-Tomás M, Baños N, Sabadell D, Corominas JM, Mestre-Fusco A, Suárez-Piñera M, Carreras R.	AIM: Several predictive tools of non-sentinel lymph nodes neoplastic involvement when a positive sentinel lymph node is found have been described. However, molecular factors have been rarely evaluated to build these tools. The aim of this study was to establish which factors predicted non-sentinel lymph nodes infiltration in our setting, including some molecular factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We carried out a retrospective review of 161 patients with breast cancer and a positive sentinel lymph node who had undergone axillary lymph node dissection, none of whom had received neoadjuvant treatment. Features evaluated as predictive factors for non-sentinel node positivity were: menopausal status, tumor size, histological subtype, histological grade, lymphovascular invasion, extracapsular invasion, Ki67 index, hormonal receptors, CerbB2 and p53 expression, size of sentinel lymph node metastases and number of sentinel lymph nodes affected. RESULTS: Tumor size (P = 0.001), size of sentinel lymph node metastases (P = 0.001), lobular invasive carcinoma (P = 0.05) and lymphovascular invasion (P = 0.006) were significantly associated with non-sentinel lymph node positivity. Tumor p53 positive expression was strongly associated with non-sentinel lymph node negativity (P = 0.000). In multivariate analysis, all these factors but tumor size maintained their significance. The discrimination power of the model calculated by the area under the receiver-operator curve was 0.811 (95% confidence interval, 0.741-0.880). CONCLUSION: p53 expression in breast cancer was highly predictive of non-sentinel lymph node negativity in our study. New studies should evaluate if it would be useful to add p53 expression to other existing predictive tools.
25698579	p53 isoform Δ113p53/Δ133p53 promotes DNA double-strand break repair to protect cell from death and senescence in response to DNA damage.	Gong L, Gong H, Pan X, Chang C, Ou Z, Ye S, Yin L, Yang L, Tao T, Zhang Z, Liu C, Lane DP, Peng J, Chen J.	The inhibitory role of p53 in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair seems contradictory to its tumor-suppressing property. The p53 isoform Δ113p53/Δ133p53 is a p53 target gene that antagonizes p53 apoptotic activity. However, information on its functions in DNA damage repair is lacking. Here we report that Δ113p53 expression is strongly induced by γ-irradiation, but not by UV-irradiation or heat shock treatment. Strikingly, Δ113p53 promotes DNA DSB repair pathways, including homologous recombination, non-homologous end joining and single-strand annealing. To study the biological significance of Δ113p53 in promoting DNA DSB repair, we generated a zebrafish Δ113p53(M/M) mutant via the transcription activator-like effector nuclease technique and found that the mutant is more sensitive to γ-irradiation. The human ortholog, Δ133p53, is also only induced by γ-irradiation and functions to promote DNA DSB repair. Δ133p53-knockdown cells were arrested at the G2 phase at the later stage in response to γ-irradiation due to a high level of unrepaired DNA DSBs, which finally led to cell senescence. Furthermore, Δ113p53/Δ133p53 promotes DNA DSB repair via upregulating the transcription of repair genes rad51, lig4 and rad52 by binding to a novel type of p53-responsive element in their promoters. Our results demonstrate that Δ113p53/Δ133p53 is an evolutionally conserved pro-survival factor for DNA damage stress by preventing apoptosis and promoting DNA DSB repair to inhibit cell senescence. Our data also suggest that the induction of Δ133p53 expression in normal cells or tissues provides an important tolerance marker for cancer patients to radiotherapy.
25710583	The Differential Immunohistochemical Expression of p53, c-Jun, c-Myc, and p21 Between HCV-related Hepatocellular Carcinoma With and Without Cirrhosis.	Abdou AG, Abd-Elwahed M, Badr M, Helmy M, Soliman EA, Maher D.	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) constitutes 70.48% of all liver tumors among Egyptians with multifactorial etiology and complex pathogenesis. HCV infection is the most common risk factor of HCC in Egypt, which commonly develops on top of cirrhosis (HCC-C); however, 15% to 20% of HCC are reported to arise in noncirrhotic livers (HCC-NC). This study aimed to explore the differences in the immunohistochemical expression of p53, c-Jun, c-Myc, and p21 between HCC-C and HCC-NC to verify the underlying molecular pathways and to study their role in hepatocarcinogenesis. This study investigated 103 cases of HCC (86 cases of HCC-C and 17 cases HCC-NC including tumorous and nontumorous tissues) together with 10 cases of chronic hepatitis and 10 cases of pure cirrhosis as control groups. Zero, 100%, 100%, and 50% of chronic hepatitis cases were positive for p53, c-Jun, c-Myc, and p21, respectively. All cirrhotic cases were negative for p53 and c-Jun, whereas they were all positive for c-Myc and p21. A total of 41%, 11.65%, 86.4%, and 57.3% of HCC cases showed p53, c-Jun, c-Myc, and p21 expression, respectively. The only difference between HCC-C and HCC-NC was the H-score values of p21 expression, which were higher in HCC-C compared with HCC-NC (P=0.03). HCV-related HCC commonly develops on top of cirrhosis with a minority develops on top of noncirrhotic liver. Only p21 pathway appears to be upregulated in favor of HCC-C than HCC-NC. p53 is considered as a late-event molecular carcinogen, whereas p21 and c-Myc may serve as early-event molecular carcinogen in HCC. The oncogenic role of p21 may be related to its cytoplasmic localization and its promotion of c-Myc expression. Progressive increase in the intensity of c-Myc expression from chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis to HCC may refer to its role as a multistep regulator of hepatocarcinogenesis. The marked reduction of c-Jun in HCC may refer to its tumor suppressor activity.
25738546	microRNA-214 enhances the invasion ability of breast cancer cells by targeting p53.	Wang F, Lv P, Liu X, Zhu M, Qiu X.	Breast cancer (BC) is the foremost cause of cancer-related mortality in women worldwide. An increasing number of studies has confirmed that microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) play an important role in the development and progression of BC. microRNA-214 (miR-214), a member of the miRNA family, has been demonstrated to function as both a tumor suppressor and oncogene in various types of human cancer. However, the biological function of miR-214 in BC remains unclear. The present study was designed to investigate the potential role of miR-214 in the development and progression of BC. Our results revealed that miR-214 expression was significantly increased in the BC tissues compared with the adjacent benign tissues, and that the upregulation of miR-214 was significantly associated with the invasion ability of the BC cells. Furthermore, p53, which has been reported to be downregulated in BC, was predicted to be the target gene of miR-214 using bioinformatics software programs. Moreover, luciferase reporter vectors were constructed and it was confirmed that p53 is a target of miR-214. Following the transfection of miR-214 into BC cells, we found that the overexpression of miR-214 markedly enhanced cell invasion through the downregulation of p53 expression. By contrast, the overexpression of p53 abrogated the effects of miR-214. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that miR-214 functions as an oncogene in BC, at least partly by promoting cell invasion through the downregulation of p53. Therefore, miR-214 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of BC.
25752998	Inhibitor of Aurora Kinase B Induces Differentially Cell Death and Polyploidy via DNA Damage Response Pathways in Neurological Malignancy: Shedding New Light on the Challenge of Resistance to AZD1152-HQPA.	Zekri A, Ghaffari SH, Yaghmaie M, Estiar MA, Alimoghaddam K, Modarressi MH, Ghavamzadeh A.	Aurora kinase B (AURKB), a crucial regulator of malignant mitosis, is involved in chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. AZD1152-HQPA is a selective inhibitor for AURKB activity and currently bears clinical assessment for several malignancies. However, the effect of this drug still needs to be elucidated in neurological malignancies. In this study, we investigated the restrictive potentials of AZD1152-HQPA in U87MG and SK-N-MC. AZD1152-HQPA treatment resulted in growth arrest, modification of cell cycle, and inhibition of colony formation in both cell lines. Furthermore, lower concentrations of AZD1152-HQPA profoundly induced apoptosis in U87GM (p53/p73 wild type) cells in parallel with an upregulation of p53 and its target genes BAX, BAD, APAF1, and PUMA. But remarkably, SK-N-MC (p53/p73 double null) responded to AZD1152-HQPA at much higher concentrations with an upregulation of genes involved in cell cycle progression, induction of excessive endoreduplication, and polyploidy rather than apoptosis. Although SK-N-MC was resistant to AZD1152-HQPA, we did not find a mutation in the coding sequence of Aurora B gene or overexpressions of ABCG2 and ABCB1 as reported previously to be resistance mechanisms. However, our results suggest that p53/p73 status could be an important mechanism for the type of response and resistance of the tumor cells to AZD1152-HQPA. Collectively, inhibition of Aurora kinase B differentially induced cell death and polyploidy via DNA damage response pathways, depending on the status of p53/p73. We suggest p53/p73 could be a key regulator of sensitivity to AZD1152-HQPA and their status should be explored in clinical response to this ongoing drug in clinical trials.
26184141	CAPE Analogs Induce Growth Arrest and Apoptosis in Breast Cancer Cells.	Beauregard AP, Harquail J, Lassalle-Claux G, Belbraouet M, Jean-Francois J, Touaibia M, Robichaud GA.	Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death amongst women worldwide. As a result, many have turned their attention to new alternative approaches to treat this disease. Caffeic acid phenylethyl ester (CAPE), a well-known active compound from bee propolis, has been previously identified as a strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral and anticancer molecule. In fact, CAPE is well documented as inducing cell death by inhibiting NFκB and by inducing pro-apoptotic pathways (i.e., p53). With the objective of developing stronger anticancer compounds, we studied 18 recently described CAPE derivatives for their ability to induce apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines. Five of the said compounds, including CAPE, were selected and subsequently characterised for their anticancer mechanism of action. We validated that CAPE is a potent inducer of caspase-dependent apoptosis. Interestingly, some newly synthesized CAPE derivatives also showed greater cell death activity than the lead CAPE structure. Similarly to CAPE, analog compounds elicited p53 activation. Interestingly, one compound in particular, analog 10, induced apoptosis in a p53-mutated cell line. These results suggest that our new CAPE analog compounds may display the capacity to induce breast cancer apoptosis in a p53-dependent and/or independent manner. These CAPE analogs could thus provide new therapeutic approaches for patients with varying genotypic signatures (such as p53 mutations) in a more specific and targeted fashion.
26119958	Anti-Colon Cancer Effects of 6-Shogaol Through G2/M Cell Cycle Arrest by p53/p21-cdc2/cdc25A Crosstalk.	Qi LW, Zhang Z, Zhang CF, Anderson S, Liu Q, Yuan CS, Wang CZ.	Chemopreventive agents can be identified from botanicals. Recently, there has been strong support for the potential of 6-shogaol, a natural compound from dietary ginger (Zingiber officinale), in cancer chemoprevention. However, whether 6-shogaol inhibits the growth of colorectal tumors in vivo remains unknown, and the underlying anticancer mechanisms have not been well characterized. In this work, we observed that 6-shogaol (15 mg/kg) significantly inhibited colorectal tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. We show that 6-shogaol inhibited HCT-116 and SW-480 cell proliferation with IC50 of 7.5 and 10 μM, respectively. Growth of HCT-116 cells was arrested at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, primarily mediated by the up-regulation of p53, the CDK inhibitor p21(waf1/cip1) and GADD45α, and by the down-regulation of cdc2 and cdc25A. Using p53(-/-) and p53(+/+) HCT-116 cells, we confirmed that p53/p21 was the main pathway that contributed to the G2/M cell cycle arrest by 6-shogaol. 6-Shogaol induced apoptosis, mainly through the mitochondrial pathway, and the bcl-2 family might act as a key regulator. Our results demonstrated that 6-shogaol induces cancer cell death by inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. 6-Shogaol could be an active natural product in colon cancer chemoprevention.
26022453	Cutaneous squamous and neuroendocrine carcinoma: genetically and immunohistochemically different from Merkel cell carcinoma.	Pulitzer MP, Brannon AR, Berger MF, Louis P, Scott SN, Jungbluth AA, Coit DG, Brownell I, Busam KJ.	Cutaneous neuroendocrine (Merkel cell) carcinoma most often arises de novo in the background of a clonally integrated virus, the Merkel cell polyomavirus, and is notable for positive expression of retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) protein and low expression of p53 compared with the rare Merkel cell polyomavirus-negative Merkel cell carcinomas. Combined squamous and Merkel cell tumors are consistently negative for Merkel cell polyomavirus. Little is known about their immunophenotypic or molecular profile. Herein, we studied 10 combined cutaneous squamous cell and neuroendocrine carcinomas for immunohistochemical expression of p53, retinoblastoma 1 protein, neurofilament, p63, and cytokeratin 20 (CK20). We compared mutation profiles of five combined Merkel cell carcinomas and seven 'pure' Merkel cell carcinomas using targeted next-generation sequencing. Combined tumors were from the head, trunk, and leg of Caucasian males and one female aged 52-89. All cases were highly p53- and p63-positive and neurofilament-negative in the squamous component, whereas RB1-negative in both components. Eight out of 10 were p53-positive, 3/10 p63-positive, and 3/10 focally neurofilament-positive in the neuroendocrine component. Six out of 10 were CK20-positive in any part. By next-generation sequencing, combined tumors were highly mutated, with an average of 48 mutations per megabase compared with pure tumors, which showed 1.25 mutations per megabase. RB1 and p53 mutations were identified in all five combined tumors. Combined tumors represent an immunophenotypically and genetically distinct variant of primary cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinomas, notable for a highly mutated genetic profile, significant p53 expression and/or mutation, absent RB1 expression in the context of increased RB1 mutation, and minimal neurofilament expression.
26447892	Expression of Cell Cycle-associated Proteins p53, pRb, p16, p27, and Correlation With Survival: A Comparative Study on Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Verrucous Carcinoma.	Vallonthaiel AG, Singh MK, Dinda AK, Kakkar A, Thakar A, Das SN.	Verrucous carcinoma (VC) is a well-differentiated form of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with better prognosis. Differences in molecular pathogenesis between the 2 have not been well-characterized. We conducted this study to evaluate immunohistochemical expression of cell-cycle regulatory proteins p53, pRb, p16, and p27 in SCC and VC, compare the expression in these 2 neoplasms, and assess if these markers have any diagnostic or prognostic value. Sixty cases of SCC with and without lymph node metastasis and 31 cases of VC were studied. Immunohistochemical analysis for p53, pRb, p16, and p27 was performed and the results were analyzed. SCC was most frequent in tongue (52%), whereas VC in buccal mucosa (81%). Mean age of SCC patients was significantly lower than in VC. Majority of SCCs were in stage III and IV (63%), whereas VCs were in stage I and II (84%). p53 immunopositivity was more frequent in SCC (65%) than in VC (23%) (P≤0.001). VC had lower p53 as compared with well-differentiated SCC and SCC without lymph node metastasis. No significant difference was seen in pRb, p16, and p27 expression. Disease-free survival (DFS) at 1 year for SCC was 57% whereas it was 80% for VC (P=0.02). DFS and overall survival of SCC correlated with nodal status and stage; cell-cycle-associated protein expression had no association with DFS. To conclude, p53 immunoexpression differs in SCC and VC, suggesting different pathogenesis, and it may have some utility as an adjunct to morphology to differentiate between the 2. Expression of cell-cycle-associated proteins does not influence survival in SCC.
26445944	Clinicopathologic features of gastric cancer with synchronous and metachronous colorectal cancer in Korea: are microsatellite instability and p53 overexpression useful markers for predicting colorectal cancer in gastric cancer patients?	Kim HJ, Kim N, Choi YJ, Yoon H, Shin CM, Park YS, Lee HS, Ahn SH, Park DJ, Kim HH, Son IT, Kang SB, Lee DH.	BACKGROUND: A large-scale study was performed to identify the risk factors for developing synchronous and metachronous colorectal cancer (CRC) in gastric cancer (GC) patients, including microsatellite instability (MSI) and p53 overexpression. METHODS: A total of 1041 GC patients who underwent endoscopic resection or surgery and underwent colonoscopy simultaneously or during surveillance for GC were consecutively enrolled. Clinicopathologic characteristics, MSI, and p53 overexpression were compared between the GC patients with and those without synchronous and metachronous CRC. RESULTS: Of the 1041 patients, CRCs were detected in 67 (6.4 %) patients with GC. Forty-six (4.4 %) had synchronous CRC and 21 (2.0 %) had metachronous CRC. Univariate analysis indicated that age ≥63 years (P < 0.001), male sex (P = 0.005), and p53 overexpression (P = 0.040) were significantly associated with a higher incidence of CRC. However, body mass index, smoking, tumor location, tumor multiplicity, tumor histology, TNM stage, and MSI were not significantly associated with the incidence of CRC. Age ≥63 years (OR: 5.881; 95 % CI: 3.083-11.221; P < 0.001) and male sex (OR: 2.933; 95 % CI: 1.307-6.584; P = 0.009) were risk factors for CRC in GC patients according to multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: GC patients who are male and/or ≥63 years old are recommended to receive colonoscopy to detect CRC. MSI and p53 overexpression were not useful molecular markers for predicting CRC in GC.
25535952	Comparative validated molecular modeling of p53-HDM2 inhibitors as antiproliferative agents.	Mondal C, Halder AK, Adhikari N, Saha A, Saha KD, Gayen S, Jha T.	Tumor suppressor protein p53 regulates the cell cycle and inhibits tumor growth. It is inactivated by mutation or binding with human double minute 2 (HDM2) protein. The HDM2 is a promising target for treatment of p53 protein related cancers. Molecular modeling techniques such as 2D-QSAR, pharmacophore mapping and 3D-QSAR analyses were performed on 155 structurally diverse HDM2 inhibitors to understand structural and physicochemical requirements for higher activity. The linear and spline 2D-QSAR models were developed through multiple linear regression and genetic functional algorithm methods. The 2D-QSAR models suggested that number of fluorine, chlorine, tertiary nitrogen atoms as well as donor feature, stereogenic centers and higher value of solvent accessible surface area are important features in defining activity. Monte Carlo method was applied to generate QSAR models that determined structural indicators (alerts) for increase or decrease of the biological activity. Ligand-based pharmacophore mapping showed importance of two hydrophobic, one hydrophobic aromatic, one ring aromatic and one donor features. The structure-based pharmacophore model demonstrated significance of two hydrophobic, one ring aromatic and two acceptor features. The pharmacophore (ligand) aligned structures were subjected to 3D-QSAR analyses. The structure-based pharmacophore was also used for pharmacophore restraint molecular docking to analyze ligand-receptor interactions and for adjudging predictability as well as validation of different modeling techniques. These comparative molecular modeling techniques may help to design novel HDM2 inhibitors.
26453893	Olaquindox induces DNA damage via the lysosomal and mitochondrial pathway involving ROS production and p53 activation in HEK293 cells.	Yang Y, Jiang L, She Y, Chen M, Li Q, Yang G, Geng C, Tang L, Zhong L, Jiang L, Liu X.	Olaquindox (OLA) is a potent antibacterial agent used as a feed additive and growth promoter. In this study, the genotoxic potential of OLA was investigated in the human embryonic kidney cell line 293 (HEK293). Results showed that OLA caused significant increases of DNA migration. Lysosomal membrane permeability and mitochondrial membrane potential were reduced after treatment with OLA. OLA was shown to induce ROS production and GSH depletion. The expression of p53 protein is increased in cells incubated with OLA. The activation of p53 and ATM gene was assessed by exposure to OLA. Furthermore, NAC reduced DNA migration, ROS formation, GSH depletion and the expression of the p53 protein and gene. And desipramine significantly decreased AO fluorescence intensity and the expression of the p53 protein and gene. These results support the assumption that OLA exerted genotoxic effects and induced DNA strand breaks in HEK293 cells, possibly through lysosomal-mitochondrial pathway involving ROS production and p53 activation.
26459178	Mithramycin Depletes Specificity Protein 1 and Activates p53 to Mediate Senescence and Apoptosis of Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma Cells.	Rao M, Atay S, Shukla V, Hong Y, Upham T, Ripley T, Hong JA, Zhang M, Reardon E, Fetsch P, Miettinen M, Li X, Peer CJ, Sissung TM, Figg WD, De Rienzo A, Bueno R, Schrump D.	PURPOSE: Specificity protein 1 (SP1) is an oncogenic transcription factor over-expressed in various human malignancies. This study sought to examine SP1 expression in malignant pleural mesotheliomas (MPM), and ascertain the potential efficacy of targeting SP1 in these neoplasms. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: qRT-PCR, immunoblot and immunohistochemistry techniques were used to evaluate SP1 expression in cultured MPM cells and MPM specimens and normal mesothelial cells/pleura. MTS, chemotaxis, soft agar, ß-galactosidase and Apo-BrdU techniques were used to assess proliferation, migration, clonogenicity, senescence and apoptosis in MPM cells following SP1 knockdown, p53 over-expression, or mithramycin treatment. Murine subcutaneous and intraperitoneal (IP) xenograft models were used to examine effects of mithramycin on MPM growth in vivo. Microarray, qRT-PCR, immunoblot and chromatin immunoprecipitation techniques were used to examine gene expression profiles mediated by mithramycin and combined SP1 knockdown/p53 over-expression, and correlate these changes with SP1 and p53 levels within target gene promoters. RESULTS: MPM cells and tumors exhibited higher SP1 mRNA and protein levels relative to control cells/tissues. SP1 knockdown significantly inhibited proliferation, migration and clonogenicity of MPM cells. Mithramycin depleted SP1 and activated p53, dramatically inhibiting proliferation and clonogenicity of MPM cells. IP mithramycin significantly inhibited growth of subcutaneous MPM xenografts, and completely eradicated mesothelioma carcinomatosis in 75% of mice. Mithramycin modulated genes mediating oncogene signaling, cell cycle regulation, senescence and apoptosis in-vitro and in-vivo. The growth inhibitory effects of mithramycin in MPM cells were recapitulated by combined SP1 knockdown/p53 overexpression. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide preclinical rationale for phase II evaluation of mithramycin in mesothelioma patients.
26192233	Bisindole-PBD regulates breast cancer cell proliferation via SIRT-p53 axis.	Sarma P, Bag I, Ramaiah MJ, Kamal A, Bhadra U, Pal Bhadra M.	In a previous study we reported the role of potent bisindole-PBD conjugate as an inclusion in the arsenal of breast cancer therapeutics. In breast cancer cell proliferation, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway plays a crucial role by prosurvival mechanism that inhibits programmed cell death. Here, 2 breast cancer cells lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 were treated with Vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid / SAHA) and bisindole-PBD (5b). We have investigated the effect on PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and SIRT expression including epigenetic regulation. There was consistent decrease in the level of PI3K, AKT, mTOR proteins upon treatment of 5b in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines compared to untreated controls. Treatment with caspase inhibitor (Q-VD-OPH) confirmed that the effect of 5b on PI3K signaling was ahead of apoptosis. Real time PCR and western blot analysis showed profound reduction in the mRNA and protein levels of SIRT1 and SIRT2. Molecular docking studies also supported the interaction of 5b with various amino acids of SIRT2 proteins. Treatment with 5b caused epigenetic changes that include increase of acetylated forms of p53, increase of histone acetylation at p21 promoter as well as decrease in methylation state of p21 gene. Compound 5b thus acts as SIRT inhibitor and cause p53 activation via inhibition of growth factor signaling and activation of p53 dependent apoptotic signaling. This present study focuses bisindole-PBD on epigenetic alteration putting 5b as a promising therapeutic tool in the realm of breast cancer research.
26320179	The PTTG1-targeting miRNAs miR-329, miR-300, miR-381, and miR-655 inhibit pituitary tumor cell tumorigenesis and are involved in a p53/PTTG1 regulation feedback loop.	Liang HQ, Wang RJ, Diao CF, Li JW, Su JL, Zhang S.	Deregulation of the pituitary tumor transforming gene (PTTG1), a newly discovered oncogene, is a hallmark of various malignancies, including pituitary tumors. However, the mechanisms regulating PTTG1 expression are still needed to be explored. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a novel class of small RNA molecules that act as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression and can play a significant role in tumor development. Here, we identified a series of miRNAs, namely, miR-329, miR-300, miR-381 and miR-655, which could target PTTG1 messenger RNA and inhibit its expression. Interestingly, all four miRNAs significantly that are downregulated in pituitary tumors were mapped to the 14q32.31 locus, which acts as a tumor suppressor in several cancers. Functional studies show that the PTTG1-targeting miRNAs inhibit proliferation, migration and invasion but induce apoptosis in GH3 and MMQ cells. Furthermore, overexpression of a PTTG1 expression vector lacking the 3'UTR partially reverses the tumor suppressive effects of these miRNAs. Next, we identified the promoter region of PTTG1-targeting miRNAs with binding sites for p53. In our hands, p53 transcriptionally activated the expression of these miRNAs in pituitary tumor cells. Finally, we found that PTTG1 could inhibit p53 transcriptional activity to the four miRNAs. These data indicate the existence of a feedback loop between PTTG1 targeting miRNAs, PTTG1 and p53 that promotes pituitary tumorigenesis. Together, these findings suggest that these PTTG1-targeting miRNAs are important players in the regulation of pituitary tumorigenesis and that these miRNAs may serve as valuable therapeutic targets for cancer treatment.
26334096	A phase 1/2 study combining gemcitabine, Pegintron and p53 SLP vaccine in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.	Dijkgraaf EM, Santegoets SJ, Reyners AK, Goedemans R, Nijman HW, van Poelgeest MI, van Erkel AR, Smit VT, Daemen TA, van der Hoeven JJ, Melief CJ, Welters MJ, Kroep JR, van der Burg SH.	PURPOSE: Preclinical tumor models show that chemotherapy has immune modulatory properties which can be exploited in the context of immunotherapy. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and immunogenicity of combinations of such an immunomodulatory chemotherapeutic agent with immunotherapy, p53 synthetic long peptide (SLP) vaccine and Pegintron (IFN-α) in patients with platinum-resistant p53-positive epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This is a phase 1/2 trial in which patients sequential 6 cycles of gemcitabine (1000 mg/kg2 iv; n = 3), gemcitabine with Pegintron before and after the first gemcitabine cycle (Pegintron 1 μg/kg sc; n = 6), and gemcitabine and Pegintron combined with p53 SLP vaccine (0.3 mg/peptide, 9 peptides; n = 6). At baseline, 22 days after the 2nd and 6th cycle, blood was collected for immunomonitoring. Toxicity, CA-125, and radiologic response were evaluated after 3 and 6 cycles of chemotherapy. RESULTS: None of the patients enrolled experienced dose-limiting toxicity. Predominant grade 3/4 toxicities were nausea/vomiting and dyspnea. Grade 1/2 toxicities consisted of fatigue (78%) and Pegintron-related flu-like symptoms (72%). Gemcitabine reduced myeloid-derived suppressor cells (p = 0.0005) and increased immune-supportive M1 macrophages (p = 0.04). Combination of gemcitabine and Pegintron stimulated higher frequencies of circulating proliferating CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells but not regulatory T-cells. All vaccinated patients showed strong vaccine-induced p53-specific T-cell responses. CONCLUSION: Combination of gemcitabine, the immune modulator Pegintron and therapeutic peptide vaccination is a viable approach in the development of combined chemo-immunotherapeutic regimens to treat cancer.
26408335	Disorder, oscillatory dynamics and state switching: the role of c-Myc.	Rangarajan N, Fox Z, Singh A, Kulkarni P, Rangarajan G.	In this paper, using the intrinsically disordered oncoprotein Myc as an example, we present a mathematical model to help explain how protein oscillatory dynamics can influence state switching. Earlier studies have demonstrated that, while Myc overexpression can facilitate state switching and transform a normal cell into a cancer phenotype, its downregulation can reverse state-switching. A fundamental aspect of the model is that a Myc threshold determines cell fate in cells expressing p53. We demonstrate that a non-cooperative positive feedback loop coupled with Myc sequestration at multiple binding sites can generate bistable Myc levels. Normal quiescent cells with Myc levels below the threshold can respond to mitogenic signals to activate the cyclin/cdk oscillator for limited cell divisions but the p53/Mdm2 oscillator remains nonfunctional. In response to stress, the p53/Mdm2 oscillator is activated in pulses that are critical to DNA repair. But if stress causes Myc levels to cross the threshold, Myc inactivates the p53/Mdm2 oscillator, abrogates p53 pulses, and pushes the cyclin/cdk oscillator into overdrive sustaining unchecked proliferation seen in cancer. However, if Myc is downregulated, the cyclin/cdk oscillator is inactivated and the p53/Mdm2 oscillator is reset and the cancer phenotype is reversed.
25564305	Shared structural features of the 9aaTAD family in complex with CBP.	Piskacek M, Vasku A, Hajek R, Knight A.	A number of transactivation domains for transcription factors including p53, E2A/HEB, MLL, cMyb, CREB, FOXO3, Gcn4, Oaf1 and Pdr1 have been reported to interact with the KIX domain of general transcriptional mediators CBP, p300 or MED15. Most of those factors belong to the already established Nine amino acid Transactivation Domain (9aaTAD) family. By using available structural data, we found binding analogy for the 9aaTAD in the MLL-KIX and also E2A/HEB-KIX complexes. We recognized two distinct TAD formations in the KIX complex. In the E2A/HEB-KIX complex, the leucine position is determined by the prolonged helical structure including the 9aaTAD and the leucine (long-helical TAD). However in the MLL-KIX complex, the equal position of 9aaTAD and proximal leucine is achieved differently by leucine-turn-helix structural architecture. Furthermore, the FOXO3-KIX complex shares structural analogy with the E2A-KIX complex in respect of both 9aaTAD and proximal leucine. Next, from (i) sequence alignment of the identified 9aaTADs in p53, E2A/HEB and MLL proteins and (ii) the resolved structure of the MLL-KIX and E2A/HEB-KIX complexes, we generated a plausible structural model for p53 that could be used also for other members of the 9aaTAD family. The position of 9aaTADs in Oaf1-, Pdr1- and Gcn4-MED15 KIX complexes and 9aaTAD composition are in good agreement with E2A, MLL, FOXO3 and p53. Analyses of structural data in this study define fundamental structural requirements and shed more light on the ambiguous 9aaTAD domain.
26475335	SAR405838: A novel and potent inhibitor of the MDM2:p53 axis for the treatment of dedifferentiated liposarcoma.	Bill KL, Garnett J, Meaux I, Ma XY, Bolshakov S, Creighton CJ, Barriere C, Dubusche L, Lazar A, Prudner BC, Casadei L, Braggio DA, Lopez G, Zewdu A, Bid HK, Lev D, Pollock RE.	Dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS) is an aggressive malignancy that can recur locally or disseminate even after multidisciplinary care. Genetically amplified and expressed MDM2, often referred to as a "hallmark" of DDLPS, mostly sustains a wild-type p53 genotype, substantiating the p53-MDM2 axis as a potential therapeutic target for DDLPS. Here we report on the preclinical effects of SAR405838, a novel and highly selective MDM2 small-molecule inhibitor, in both in vitro and in vivo DDLPS models.The therapeutic effectiveness of SAR405838 was compared to the known MDM2 antagonists Nutlin-3a and MI-219. The effects of MDM2 inhibition were assessed in both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro and in vivo microarray analyses were performed to assess differentially expressed genes induced by SAR405838, as well as the pathways that these modulated genes enriched.SAR405838 effectively stabilized p53 and activated the p53 pathway, resulting in abrogated cellular proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Similar results were observed with Nutlin-3a and MI-219; however, significantly higher concentrations were required. In vitro effectiveness of SAR405838 activity was recapitulated in DDLPS xenograft models where significant decreases in tumorigenicity were observed. Microarray analyses revealed genes enriching the p53 signaling pathway as well as genomic stability and DNA damage following SAR405838 treatment.SAR405838 is currently in early phase clinical trials for a number of malignancies, including sarcoma, and our in vitro and in vivo results support its use as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of DDLPS.
25579814	Structural plasticity of methyllysine recognition by the tandem tudor domain of 53BP1.	Tong Q, Cui G, Botuyan MV, Rothbart SB, Hayashi R, Musselman CA, Singh N, Appella E, Strahl BD, Mer G, Kutateladze TG.	p53 is dynamically regulated through various posttranslational modifications (PTMs), which differentially modulate its function and stability. The dimethylated marks p53K370me2 and p53K382me2 are associated with p53 activation or stabilization and both are recognized by the tandem Tudor domain (TTD) of 53BP1, a p53 cofactor. Here we detail the molecular mechanisms for the recognition of p53K370me2 and p53K382me2 by 53BP1. The solution structures of TTD in complex with the p53K370me2 and p53K382me2 peptides show a remarkable plasticity of 53BP1 in accommodating these diverse dimethyllysine-containing sequences. We demonstrate that dimeric TTDs are capable of interacting with the two PTMs on a single p53K370me2K382me2 peptide, greatly strengthening the 53BP1-p53 interaction. Analysis of binding affinities of TTD toward methylated p53 and histones reveals strong preference of 53BP1 for p53K382me2, H4K20me2, and H3K36me2 and suggests a possible role of multivalent contacts of 53BP1 in p53 targeting to and accumulation at the sites of DNA damage.
26462467	Expression and protease activity of mouse legumain are regulated by the oncogene/transcription co-activator, DJ-1 through p53 and cleavage of annexin A2 is increased in DJ-1-knockout cells.	Yamane T, Yamamoto Y, Nakano Y, Nakagaki T, Ohkubo I, Ariga H.	Legumain (EC 3.4.22.34) is an asparaginyl endopeptidase. Strong legumain activity was observed in the mouse kidney, and legumain was highly expressed in tumors. We previously reported that bovine kidney annexin A2 was co-purified with legumain and that legumain cleaved the N-terminal region of annexin A2 at an Asn residue in vitro and in vivo. Recently, we found that transcription of the legumain gene is regulated by the p53 tumor suppressor in HCT116 cells. We and others reported that DJ-1/PARK7, a cancer- and Parkinson's disease-associated protein, works as a coactivator to various transcription factors, including the androgen receptor, p53, PSF, Nrf2, SREBP and RREB1. In this study, we found that expression levels of legumain mRNA and protein and legumain activity were increased in DJ-1-knockout cells. Furthermore, we found that DJ-1 binds to the p53-binding site on intron 1 of the mouse legumain gene in wild-type cells and that cleavage of annexin A2 was increased in DJ-1-knockout cells. These results suggest that legumain expression and activation and cleavage of annexin A2 are regulated by DJ-1 through p53.
25435368	Impact of the Mdm2(SNP309-G) allele on a murine model of colorectal cancer.	Zhang X, Pageon L, Post SM.	A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter of the Mdm2 gene (Mdm2(SNP309-G)) results in an increased Mdm2 expression, partial attenuation of the p53 pathway and accelerated tumor development. Clinical case-control studies indicate the Mdm2(SNP309-)(G) allele associates with a significant increase in colorectal cancer (CRC) risk that is heightened in women, but the biological significance of this polymorphism has never been directly evaluated. To examine whether the Mdm2(SNP309-)(G) allele contributes to colorectal cancer, we generated cohorts of mice harboring either the G (minor allelic variant) or T (major allelic variant) allele and treated them with azoxymethane (AOM), a carcinogen that induces sporadic colorectal cancer. Mdm2(SNP309-G/G) mice displayed a significant reduction in survival following AOM treatment with more colonic lesions in a wider distribution throughout the lower and upper colon and an attenuated apoptotic response following exposure. AOM did not significantly induce stabilization of wild-type p53 or activate p53 downstream targets following AOM treatment, regardless of the genotype. Instead, Mdm2(SNP309-G/G) colons had significant changes in the expression of genes that regulate Mdm2 transcription (ERα and Sp1) as well as downstream targets of Mdm2. Together these results suggest the Mdm2(SNP309-)(G) allele significantly impacts CRC through mechanisms outside the p53 pathway.
25765901	Reciprocal repression between TUSC7 and miR-23b in gastric cancer.	Qi P, Xu MD, Shen XH, Ni SJ, Huang D, Tan C, Weng WW, Sheng WQ, Zhou XY, Du X.	Recently, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were demonstrated to play important regulatory roles in biological processes and cancer biology. However, the overall pathophysiological contribution of lncRNAs to gastric cancer (GC) remains largely unknown. In this study, differentially expressed lncRNAs in GC and paired adjacent normal tissue samples were identified by microarray and were validated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). One particular lncRNA, tumour suppressor candidate 7 (TUSC7), was analyzed in sequential large cohorts, and the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test for comparisons was used to analyse the survival data. The results indicated that TUSC7 was downregulated in GC samples and was an independent prognostic indicator of disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) in GC patients. Applying loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches, we determined that TUSC7 suppressed tumour cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we showed that TUSC7 was a direct transcriptional target of p53 via interaction of p53 with the putative p53-response element in the upstream region of TUSC7. Finally, we demonstrated reciprocal repression between TUSC7 and miR-23b; in contrast to TUSC7, miR-23b promoted cell growth. The results indicated that TUSC7 is a p53-regulated tumour suppressor that acts in part by repressing miR-23b and that TUSC7 may be a key regulatory hub in GC.
25576833	Activation of p53 mediated glycolytic inhibition-oxidative stress-apoptosis pathway in Dalton's lymphoma by a ruthenium (II)-complex containing 4-carboxy N-ethylbenzamide.	Koiri RK, Trigun SK, Mishra L.	There is a general agreement that most of the cancer cells switch over to aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) and upregulate antioxidant enzymes to prevent oxidative stress induced apoptosis. Thus, there is an evolving view to target these metabolic alterations by novel anticancer agents to restrict tumor progression in vivo. Previously we have reported that when a non toxic dose (10 mg/kg bw i.p.) of a novel anticancer ruthenium(II)-complex containing 4-carboxy N-ethylbenzamide; Ru(II)-CNEB, was administered to the Dalton's lymphoma (DL) bearing mice, it regressed DL growth by inducing apoptosis in the DL cells. It also inactivated M4-LDH (M4-lactate dehydrogenase), an enzyme that drives anaerobic glycolysis in the tumor cells. In the present study we have investigated whether this compound is able to modulate regulation of glycolytic inhibition-apoptosis pathway in the DL cells in vivo. We observed that Ru(II)-CNEB could decline expression of the inducible form of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (iPFK2: PFKFB3), the master regulator of glycolysis in the DL cells. The complex also activated superoxide dismutase (the H2O2 producing enzyme) but declined the levels of catalase and glutathione peroxidase (the two H2O2 degrading enzymes) to impose oxidative stress in the DL cells. This was consistent with the enhanced p53 level, decline in Bcl2/Bax ratio and activation of caspase 9 in those DL cells. The findings suggest that Ru(II)-CNEB is able to activate oxidative stress-apoptosis pathway via p53 (a tumor supressor protein) mediated repression of iPFK2, a key glycolytic regulator, in the DL cells in vivo.
26511486	Methylseleninic acid super-activates P53-senescence cancer progression barrier in prostate lesions of Pten-knockout mouse.	Wang L, Guo X, Wang J, Jiang C, Bosland MC, Lu J, Deng Y.	Monomethylated selenium (MM-Se) forms that are precursors of methylselenol such as methylseleninic acid (MSeA) differ in metabolism and anti-cancer activities in preclinical cell and animal models from seleno-methionine that had failed to exert preventive efficacy against prostate cancer (PCa) in North American men. Given that human PCa arises from precancerous lesions such as high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HG-PIN) which frequently have lost PTEN tumor suppressor permitting AKT oncogenic signaling, we tested the efficacy of MSeA to inhibit HG-PIN progression in Pten prostate specific knockout (KO) mice and assessed the mechanistic involvement of p53-mediated cellular senescence and of the androgen receptor (AR). We observed that short-term (4 weeks) oral MSeA treatment significantly increased expression of P53 and P21Cip1 proteins and senescence-associated-β-galactosidase staining, and reduced Ki-67 cell proliferation index in Pten KO prostate epithelium. Long-term (25 weeks) MSeA administration significantly suppressed HG-PIN phenotype, tumor weight, and prevented emergence of invasive carcinoma in Pten KO mice. Mechanistically, the long-term MSeA treatment not only sustained P53-mediated senescence, but also markedly reduced AKT phosphorylation and AR abundance in the Pten KO prostate. Importantly, these cellular and molecular changes were not observed in the prostate of wild type littermates which were similarly treated with MSeA. Since p53 signaling is likely to be intact in HG-PIN compared to advanced PCa, the selective super-activation of p53-mediated senescence by MSeA suggests a new paradigm of cancer chemoprevention by strengthening a cancer progression barrier through induction of irreversible senescence with additional suppression of AR and AKT oncogenic signaling.
26493553	p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism confers the susceptibility to endometriosis among Asian and Caucasian populations.	Lao X, Chen Z, Qin A.	Findings from studies on the association between the p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and endometriosis susceptibility have so far been inconsistent. Therefore, we undertook a meta-analysis to clarify the association of p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism with the risk of endometriosis.Relevant studies were chosen by searching PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library databases, CNKI, Wanfang database, and CBM for articles published before and up to April 30, 2015. Two independent reviewers performed the eligibility evaluation and data extraction. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the overall risk estimate.Eleven case-control studies involving 1834 endometriosis cases and 2331 controls were included. Pooled data analysis suggested that the p53 72Pro variant is a significant endometriosis risk factors in comparison to the 72Arg variant (Pro vs. Arg: OR = 1.298, 95 % CI 1.082-1.558; Pro/Pro vs. Arg/Arg: OR = 1.751, 95 % CI 1.130-2.711; Pro/Arg vs. Arg/Arg: OR = 1.530, 95 % CI 1.174-1.994), which was strengthened in the dominant model (Pro/Pro + Arg/Pro vs. Arg/Arg: OR = 1.570, 95 % CI = 1.181-2.087). In the stratified analysis by ethnicity and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in the controls, we found strong associations in Asians and in studies that were consistent with HWE. However, the analyses of the revised American Fertility Society (rAFS) stage and the menopausal status subgroup did not reveal any significant associations.In conclusion, the p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism was closely related to the risk of endometriosis, especially in Asian populations.
25813624	Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of p53 contributes to TPEN-induced neuronal apoptosis.	Kim HL, Ra H, Kim KR, Lee JM, Im H, Kim YH.	Depletion of intracellular zinc by N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN) induces p53-mediated protein synthesis-dependent apoptosis of mouse cortical neurons. Here, we examined the requirement for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 as an upstream regulator of p53 in zinc depletion-induced neuronal apoptosis. First, we found that chemical inhibition or genetic deletion of PARP-1 markedly attenuated TPEN-induced apoptosis of cultured mouse cortical neurons. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of p53 occurred starting 1 h after TPEN treatment. Suggesting the critical role of PARP-1, the TPEN-induced increase of stability and activity of p53 as well as poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of p53 was almost completely blocked by PARP inhibition. Consistent with this, the induction of downstream proapoptotic proteins PUMA and NOXA was noticeably reduced by chemical inhibitors or genetic deletion of PARP-1. TPEN-induced cytochrome C release into the cytosol and caspase-3 activation were also blocked by inhibition of PARP-1. Taken together, these findings indicate that PARP-1 is essential for TPEN-induced neuronal apoptosis.
25565771	Arsenic sulfide, the main component of realgar, a traditional Chinese medicine, induces apoptosis of gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.	Zhang L, Tian W, Kim S, Ding W, Tong Y, Chen S.	BACKGROUND: Arsenic sulfide (As4S4), the main component of realgar, a traditional Chinese medicine, has shown antitumor efficacy in several tumor types, especially for acute promyelocytic leukemia. In this study, we aimed to explore the efficacy and mechanism of As4S4 in gastric cancer. METHODS: The effect of As4S4 on cell proliferation and apoptosis of gastric cancer cells was investigated by MTT assay, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, and annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining using gastric cancer cell lines AGS (harboring wild-type p53) and MGC803 (harboring mutant p53) in vitro. The expression of apoptosis-related proteins was measured by Western blotting, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry analysis. Mouse xenograft models were established by inoculation with MGC803 cells, and the morphology and the proportion of apoptotic cells in tumor tissues were detected by hematoxylin and eosin staining and TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, respectively. RESULTS: As4S4 inhibited the proliferation and induced apoptosis of AGS and MGC803 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. As4S4 upregulated the expression of Bax and MDM2 while downregulated the expression of Bcl-2. The expression of p53 increased significantly in the AGS cells but did not readily increase in the MGC803 cells, which harbored mutant p53. Pifithrin-α, a p53 inhibitor, blocked the modulation of As4S4 on AGS cells, but not on MGC803 cells. Using xenograft as a model, we showed that As4S4 suppressed tumor growth and induced apoptosis in vivo and that the expression of p53 increased accordingly. CONCLUSION: As4S4 is a potent cytotoxic agent for gastric cancer cells, as it induced apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo through a p53-dependent pathway. Our data indicate that As4S4 may have therapeutic potential in gastric cancer.
25742638	Abundant immunohistochemical expression of dopamine D2 receptor and p53 protein in meningiomas: follow-up, relation to gender, age, tumor grade, and recurrence.	Trott G, Pereira-Lima JF, Leães CG, Ferreira NP, Barbosa-Coutinho LM, Oliveira MC.	Meningiomas are common, usually benign tumors, with a high postoperative recurrence rate. However, the genesis and development of these tumors remain controversial. We aimed to investigate the presence and implications of a mutated p53 protein and dopamine D2 receptor in a representative series of meningiomas and to correlate these findings with age, gender, tumor grade, and recurrence. Tumor tissue samples of 157 patients diagnosed with meningioma (37 males and 120 females, mean age 53.6 ± 14.3 years) who underwent surgical resection between 2003 and 2012 at our institution were immunohistochemically evaluated for the presence of p53 protein and dopamine D2 receptor and were followed-up to analyze tumor recurrence or regrowth. Tumors were classified as grades I (n=141, 89.8%), II (n=13, 8.3%), or grade III (n=3, 1.9%). Dopamine D2 receptor and p53 protein expression were positive in 93.6% and 49.7% of the cases, respectively. Neither of the markers showed significant expression differences among different tumor grades or recurrence or regrowth statuses. Our findings highlight the potential role of p53 protein in meningioma development and/or progression. The high positivity of dopamine D2 receptor observed in this study warrants further investigation of the therapeutic potential of dopamine agonists in the evolution of meningiomas.
25512615	p53 Mutation Directs AURKA Overexpression via miR-25 and FBXW7 in Prostatic Small Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma.	Li Z, Sun Y, Chen X, Squires J, Nowroozizadeh B, Liang C, Huang J.	Prostatic small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNC) is a rare but aggressive form of prostate cancer that is negative for androgen receptor (AR) and not responsive to hormonal therapy. The molecular etiology of this prostate cancer variant is not well understood; however, mutation of the p53 (TP53) tumor suppressor in prostate neuroendocrine cells inactivates the IL8-CXCR2-p53 pathway that normally inhibits cellular proliferation, leading to the development of SCNC. SCNC also overexpresses Aurora kinase A (AURKA) which is considered to be a viable therapeutic target. Therefore, the relationship of these two molecular events was studied, and we show that p53 mutation leads to increased expression of miR-25 and downregulation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXW7, resulting in elevated levels of Aurora kinase A. This study demonstrates an intracellular pathway by which p53 mutation leads to Aurora kinase A expression, which is critically important for the rapid proliferation and aggressive behavior of prostatic SCNC.The pathogenesis of prostatic SCNC involves a p53 and Aurora Kinase A signaling mechanism, both potentially targetable pathways.
26117336	Oncogenic miR-17/20a Forms a Positive Feed-forward Loop with the p53 Kinase DAPK3 to Promote Tumorigenesis.	Cai Z, Cao R, Zhang K, Xue Y, Zhang C, Zhou Y, Zhou J, Sun H, Fu XD.	MicroRNAs (miRs) are a class of small regulatory RNAs that have been implicated in diverse biological pathways, including cancer. miR-17/20a encoded by the c13orf25 locus is among the first miRs discovered to have oncogenic functions. The E2F family members have been established as the targets for these oncomiRs, which form a negative feedback loop to control cell cycle progression. However, this pathway does not seem to be sufficient to account for elevated expression of these oncomiRs in cancer cells to promote tumorigenesis. Here we report that miR-17/20a targets a p53 activating kinase DAPK3, leading to p53-dependent transcriptional de-repression of the oncomiRs. We demonstrate that DAPK3 plays a central role in preventing miR-17/20a depletion-induced genome instability and in miR-17/20a overexpression-triggered tumor formation. This newly identified tumorigenic pathway may thus contribute to miR-17/20a amplification and tumor growth in diverse human cancers.
25368905	Evaluation of Protein Ubiquitylation in Heart Tissue of Rats Exposed to Diazinon (an Organophosphate Insecticide) and Crocin (an Active Saffron Ingredient): Role of HIF-1α.	Razavi BM, Hosseinzadeh H, Imenshahidi M, Malekian M, Ramezani M, Abnous K.	 Organophosphate compounds, such as diazinon (DZN), are widely used in agriculture and can lead to formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cardiovascular system. ROS are highly toxic since they can cause serious changes in proteins including ubiquitylation. Crocin (a carotenoid isolated from saffron), has protective effects against DZN cardiotoxicity. In this study level of total protein ubiquitylation as markers of oxidative stress and level of ubiquitin-HIF-1α and P53, known substrates of ubiquitylation, in rat hearts exposed to DZN and crocin were evaluated. Rats were divided into 7 groups: corn oil (control), DZN (15 mg/kg/day, gavage), crocin (12.5, 25, 50 mg/kg/day, i. p.) plus DZN, vitamin E (200 IU/kg, i. p., 3 days a week) plus DZN and crocin (50 mg/kg/day, i. p.). Treatments were continued for 4 weeks. Total protein ubiquitylation, total HIF-1α and P53 were analyzed by western blotting. Total HIF-1α and P53 were purified by immunoprecipitation (IP) and ubiquitin- HIF-1α and P53 were analyzed by western blotting. Higher protein ubiquitylation levels were observed in DZN treated rats. Decrease in ubiquitin-HIF-1α was also shown, and leads to higher HIF-1α protein levels in DZN group. Crocin (50 mg/kg) and vit. E protected cells against DZN protein ubiquitylation. Significant differences were not observed between the ubiquitin - P53 and total P53 protein levels. Our results showed that ubiquitylation could be considered as a marker of oxidative stress in rats exposed to DZN. Increase in level of HIF-α may compensate adverse effect of DNZ in rat heart.
25240597	A tumor-targeting p53 nanodelivery system limits chemoresistance to temozolomide prolonging survival in a mouse model of glioblastoma multiforme.	Kim SS, Rait A, Kim E, Pirollo KF, Chang EH.	Development of temozolomide (TMZ) resistance contributes to the poor prognosis for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients. It was previously demonstrated that delivery of exogenous wild-type tumor suppressor gene p53 via a tumor-targeted nanocomplex (SGT-53) which crosses the blood-brain barrier could sensitize highly TMZ-resistant GBM tumors to TMZ. Here we assessed whether SGT-53 could inhibit development of TMZ resistance. SGT-53 significantly chemosensitized TMZ-sensitive human GBM cell lines (U87 and U251), in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, in an intracranial GBM tumor model, two cycles of concurrent treatment with systemically administered SGT-53 and TMZ inhibited tumor growth, increased apoptosis and most importantly, significantly prolonged median survival. In contrast TMZ alone had no significant effect on median survival compared to a single cycle of TMZ. These results suggest that combining SGT-53 with TMZ appears to limit development of TMZ resistance, prolonging its anti-tumor effect and could be a more effective therapy for GBM.Using human glioblastoma multiforma cell lines, this research team demonstrated that the delivery of exogenous wild-type tumor suppressor gene p53 via a tumor-targeted nanocomplex limited the development of temozolomide resistance and prolonged its anti-tumor effect, which may enable future human application of this or similar techniques.
25746954	Novel structurally similar chromene derivatives with opposing effects on p53 and apoptosis mechanisms in colorectal HCT116 cancer cells.	Lima CF, Costa M, Proença MF, Pereira-Wilson C.	In the present work, novel chromene derivatives fused with the imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine nucleus were tested for their anticancer potential in the human colorectal cancer HCT116 cells. Compounds 2a and 2c showed significant growth inhibitory activity with GI50 of 15 μM and 11 μM, respectively. Compound 2c, the most potent, has a carbamate group in position 8 of the pyridine ring, and showed significant cell cycle arrest and induction of cell death by apoptosis, even at 5 μM. Besides different potencies, chromene analogs 2a and 2c showed different mechanisms of action. Whereas the carbamate-free chromene 2a induced cell cycle arrest at G1/G0 phase, compound 2c showed to arrest cell cycle at both S and G2 phases. Chromene derivative 2a at concentrations higher than its GI50 remarkably induced caspases-dependent apoptosis in a p53-independent manner. On the other hand, compound 2c increased significantly p53 levels and induced apoptosis in a p53- and caspases-dependent manner, even at concentrations lower than its GI50. Both compounds increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, induced mitochondria depolarization and activated MAP kinases. In conclusion, two novel and structurally similar chromene derivatives showed cytotoxicity to HCT16 cells through opposing effects on p53 levels and apoptosis mechanisms, which may be relevant for further development of drugs acting on distinct molecular targets useful in the treatment of cancers with different genetic profiles and for personalized medicine.
25258367	MRI texture analysis predicts p53 status in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.	Dang M, Lysack JT, Wu T, Matthews TW, Chandarana SP, Brockton NT, Bose P, Bansal G, Cheng H, Mitchell JR, Dort JC.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Head and neck cancer is common, and understanding the prognosis is an important part of patient management. In addition to the Tumor, Node, Metastasis staging system, tumor biomarkers are becoming more useful in understanding prognosis and directing treatment. We assessed whether MR imaging texture analysis would correctly classify oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma according to p53 status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 16 patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma was prospectively evaluated by using standard clinical, histopathologic, and imaging techniques. Tumors were stained for p53 and scored by an anatomic pathologist. Regions of interest on MR imaging were selected by a neuroradiologist and then analyzed by using our 2D fast time-frequency transform tool. The quantified textures were assessed by using the subset-size forward-selection algorithm in the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis. Features found to be significant were used to create a statistical model to predict p53 status. The model was tested by using a Bayesian network classifier with 10-fold stratified cross-validation. RESULTS: Feature selection identified 7 significant texture variables that were used in a predictive model. The resulting model predicted p53 status with 81.3% accuracy (P < .05). Cross-validation showed a moderate level of agreement (κ = 0.625). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that MR imaging texture analysis correctly predicts p53 status in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma with ∼80% accuracy. As our knowledge of and dependence on tumor biomarkers expand, MR imaging texture analysis warrants further study in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and other head and neck tumors.
26188505	Cold-inducible RNA-binding protein, CIRP, inhibits DNA damage-induced apoptosis by regulating p53.	Lee HN, Ahn SM, Jang HH.	CIRP has been implicated in apoptosis, yet its mechanism of action remains unknown. To determine the role of CIRP in DNA damage-induced apoptosis, we performed CIRP overexpression and knockdown experiments to investigate the effects of CIRP on key molecules in apoptosis pathway. Etoposide treatment was used to induce DNA damage-induced apoptosis. We found that CIRP knockdown increased p53 level, which in turn up-regulated pro-apoptotic genes and down-regulated anti-apoptotic genes. In contrast, CIRP overexpression decreased p53 level, which in turn down-regulated pro-apoptotic genes and up-regulated anti-apoptotic genes. The change in the expression levels of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes shifts the balance between life and death of cells. CIRP expression is upregulated by chronic inflammation, and this phenomenon provides an interesting interventional opportunity in cancers arising from chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation up-regulates CIRP, which in turn inhibit apoptosis. Therefore, inhibiting the function of up-regulated CIRP may have a therapeutic value in cancer.
25657114	Protosappanin B protects PC12 cells against oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced neuronal death by maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis via induction of ubiquitin-dependent p53 protein degradation.	Zeng KW, Liao LX, Zhao MB, Song FJ, Yu Q, Jiang Y, Tu PF.	Protosappanin B (PTB) is a bioactive dibenzoxocin derivative isolated from Caesalpinia sappan L. Here, we investigated the neuroprotective effects and the potential mechanisms of PTB on oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-injured PC12 cells. Results showed that PTB significantly increased cell viability, inhibited cell apoptosis and up-regulated the expression of growth-associated protein 43 (a marker of neural outgrowth). Moreover, our study revealed that PTB effectively maintained mitochondrial homeostasis by up-regulation of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), inhibition of cytochrome c release from mitochondria and inactivation of mitochondrial caspase-9/3 apoptosis pathway. Further study showed that PTB significantly promoted cytoplasmic component degradation of p53 protein, a key negative regulator for mitochondrial function, resulting in a release of Bcl-2 from p53-Bcl-2 complex and an enhancing translocation of Bcl-2 to mitochondrial outer membrane. Finally, we found the degradation of p53 protein was induced by PTB via activation of a MDM2-dependent ubiquitination process. Taken together, our findings provided a new viewpoint of neuronal protection strategy for anoxia and ischemic injury with natural small molecular dibenzoxocin derivative by activating ubiquitin-dependent p53 protein degradation as well as increasing mitochondrial function.
26333122	Subcellular Localization of Proteins Responding to Mitoxantrone-Induced DNA Damage in Leukaemic Cells.	Ćmielová J, Lesná M, Řezáčová M.	The aim of the present study was to investigate the subcellular localization of proteins participating in the double-strand break response pathway - p53, Mdm2, p21 and Chk2. MOLT-4 cells were pre-treated with mitoxantrone in concentrations 1 nmol/l and 5 nmol/l. The trypan blue technique was used to determine cell viability and proliferation. Western blotting was used to evaluate changes in p53, Mdm2 and Chk2 protein expression and sandwich ELISA was used to evaluate changes in the p21 protein amount. After 1 nmol/l mitoxantrone cells did not die, but their ability to proliferate was decreased. The p53 protein was activated and phosphorylated at serines 15 and 392 and accumulated in the nucleus after 24 and 48 h. The Mdm2 protein was present in the cytoplasm with its maximal level after 8 and 16 h. The p21 protein was detected in the nucleus after 24 and 48 h. Increased levels of phosphorylated Chk2 at threonine 68 were observed in the cytoplasmic fraction after 24 and 48 h of mitoxantrone treatment. We used mitoxantrone as an inducer of double-strand breaks to bring new data about the subcellular distribution of proteins responding to DNA damage. In MOLT-4 cells, the p53 protein was activated. p53 was phosphorylated at serines 15 and 392 and accumulated in the nucleus. The Mdm2 protein was activated in advance to p53 and occurred in the cytoplasm. The p21 protein was present in the nucleus. Chk2 kinase was activated by the phosphorylation at threonine 68 and we observed increased levels of this protein in the cytoplasmic fraction.
25772769	Autophagy is upregulated in ovarian endometriosis: a possible interplay with p53 and heme oxygenase-1.	Allavena G, Carrarelli P, Del Bello B, Luisi S, Petraglia F, Maellaro E.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the occurrence of the autophagic process in ovarian endometriomas compared with eutopic endometrium of affected women and with normal endometrium of healthy women. DESIGN: Biochemical and molecular study in tissue extracts. SETTING: University cellular pathology laboratory and university hospital. PATIENT(S): Patients with ovarian endometriosis (n = 13) and healthy women (n = 18). INTERVENTION(S): Specimens of endometrium were obtained by hysteroscopy from patients with endometriosis and from healthy control subjects; specimens of ovarian endometriomas were collected by laparoscopy. All patients underwent surgery after the end of menstrual bleeding, resulting in most of our patients (approximately 80% in each group) being in the proliferative phase. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Autophagy was evaluated by Western blot analysis of biochemical markers (LC3-II, LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and p62) and by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction of autophagy-related genes (ATG14, BECN1, ATG7, and LC3B); apoptosis-related (p53 and Bcl-2) and oxidative stress-related (heme oxygenase-1) proteins were also evaluated by Western blot analysis. RESULT(S): All tested biochemical markers and messenger RNA levels of autophagy-related genes showed a significant up-regulation of autophagy in ovarian endometriomas compared with eutopic endometria of affected or healthy women. Moreover, a significant decrease of p53 protein and a significant increase of heme oxygenase-1 protein was also evident in endometriomas. CONCLUSION(S): The upregulated autophagic process observed in ovarian endometriomas can be regarded as an integral part of endometriosis pathogenesis, possibly contributing to survival of endometriotic cells in ectopic sites and to lesion maintenance. The decreased susceptibility to apoptosis and the persistent oxidative stress experienced by endometriotic cells could favor autophagy stimulation.
26556872	Radiation and SN38 treatments modulate the expression of microRNAs, cytokines and chemokines in colon cancer cells in a p53-directed manner.	Pathak S, Meng WJ, Nandy SK, Ping J, Bisgin A, Helmfors L, Waldmann P, Sun XF.	Aberrant expression of miRNAs, cytokines and chemokines are involved in pathogenesis of colon cancer. However, the expression of p53 mediated miRNAs, cyto- and chemokines after radiation and SN38 treatment in colon cancer remains elusive. Here, human colon cancer cells, HCT116 with wild-type, heterozygous and a functionally null p53, were treated by radiation and SN38. The expression of 384 miRNAs was determined by using the TaqMan® miRNA array, and the expression of cyto- and chemokines was analyzed by Meso-Scale-Discovery instrument. Up- or down-regulations of miRNAs after radiation and SN38 treatments were largely dependent on p53 status of the cells. Cytokines, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, Il-4, IL-10, VEGF, and chemokines, IL-8, MIP-1α were increased, and IFN-γ expression was decreased after radiation, whereas, IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, Il-4, IL-10, IL-8 were decreased, and VEGF and MIP-1α were increased after SN38 treatment. Bioinformatic analysis pointed out that the highly up-regulated miRNAs, let-7f-5p, miR-455-3p, miR-98, miR-155-5p and the down-regulated miRNAs, miR-1, miR-127-5p, miR-142-5p, miR-202-5p were associated with colon cancer pathways and correlated with cyto- or chemokine expression. These miRNAs have the potential for use in colon cancer therapy as they are related to p53, pro- or anti-inflammatory cyto- or chemokines after the radiation and SN38 treatment.
25795707	Oncogenic HRAS Activates Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition and Confers Stemness to p53-Deficient Urothelial Cells to Drive Muscle Invasion of Basal Subtype Carcinomas.	He F, Melamed J, Tang MS, Huang C, Wu XR.	Muscle-invasive urothelial carcinomas of the bladder (MIUCB) exhibit frequent receptor tyrosine kinase alterations, but the precise nature of their contributions to tumor pathophysiology is unclear. Using mutant HRAS (HRAS*) as an oncogenic prototype, we obtained evidence in transgenic mice that RTK/RAS pathway activation in urothelial cells causes hyperplasia that neither progresses to frank carcinoma nor regresses to normal urothelium through a period of one year. This persistent hyperplastic state appeared to result from an equilibrium between promitogenic factors and compensatory tumor barriers in the p19-MDM2-p53-p21 axis and a prolonged G2 arrest. Conditional inactivation of p53 in urothelial cells of transgenic mice expressing HRAS* resulted in carcinoma in situ and basal-subtype MIUCB with focal squamous differentiation resembling the human counterpart. The transcriptome of microdissected MIUCB was enriched in genes that drive epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, the upregulation of which is associated with urothelial cells expressing multiple progenitor/stem cell markers. Taken together, our results provide evidence for RTK/RAS pathway activation and p53 deficiency as a combinatorial theranostic biomarker that may inform the progression and treatment of urothelial carcinoma.
26228159	Control of signaling-mediated clearance of apoptotic cells by the tumor suppressor p53.	Yoon KW, Byun S, Kwon E, Hwang SY, Chu K, Hiraki M, Jo SH, Weins A, Hakroush S, Cebulla A, Sykes DB, Greka A, Mundel P, Fisher DE, Mandinova A, Lee SW.	The inefficient clearance of dying cells can lead to abnormal immune responses, such as unresolved inflammation and autoimmune conditions. We show that tumor suppressor p53 controls signaling-mediated phagocytosis of apoptotic cells through its target, Death Domain1α (DD1α), which suggests that p53 promotes both the proapoptotic pathway and postapoptotic events. DD1α appears to function as an engulfment ligand or receptor that engages in homophilic intermolecular interaction at intercellular junctions of apoptotic cells and macrophages, unlike other typical scavenger receptors that recognize phosphatidylserine on the surface of dead cells. DD1α-deficient mice showed in vivo defects in clearing dying cells, which led to multiple organ damage indicative of immune dysfunction. p53-induced expression of DD1α thus prevents persistence of cell corpses and ensures efficient generation of precise immune responses.
25956474	Hepato-protective effect of resveratrol against acetaminophen-induced liver injury is associated with inhibition of CYP-mediated bioactivation and regulation of SIRT1-p53 signaling pathways.	Wang Y, Jiang Y, Fan X, Tan H, Zeng H, Wang Y, Chen P, Huang M, Bi H.	Resveratrol (RES) has been shown to possess many pharmacological activities including protective effect against liver damage induced by hepatotoxins. In the present study, the hepato-protective effect of RES against acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury in mice and the involved mechanisms was investigated. This study clearly demonstrated that administration of RES three days before APAP treatment significantly alleviated APAP-induced hepatotoxicity, as evidenced by morphological, histopathological, and biochemical assessments such as GSH content and serum ALT/AST activity. Treatment with RES resulted in significant inhibition of CYP2E1, CYP3A11, and CYP1A2 activities, and then caused significant inhibition of the bioactivation of APAP into toxic metabolite NAPQI. Pretreatment with RES significantly reduced APAP-induced JNK activation to protect against mitochondrial injury. Additionally, RES treatment significantly induced SIRT1 and then negatively regulated p53 signaling to induce cell proliferation-associated proteins including cyclin D1, CDK4, and PCNA to promote hepatocyte proliferation. This study demonstrated that RES prevents APAP-induced hepatotoxicity by inhibition of CYP-mediated APAP bioactivation and regulation of SIRT1, p53, cyclin D1 and PCNA to facilitate liver regeneration following APAP-induced liver injury.
26251011	Basal brain oxidative and nitrative stress levels are finely regulated by the interplay between superoxide dismutase 2 and p53.	Barone E, Cenini G, Di Domenico F, Noel T, Wang C, Perluigi M, St Clair DK, Butterfield DA.	Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are the primary reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging enzymes of the cell and catalyze the dismutation of superoxide radicals O2 (-) to H2 O2 and molecular oxygen (O2 ). Among the three forms of SOD identified, manganese-containing SOD (MnSOD, SOD2) is a homotetramer located wholly in the mitochondrial matrix. Because of the SOD2 strategic location, it represents the first mechanism of defense against the augmentation of ROS/reactive nitrogen species levels in the mitochondria for preventing further damage. This study seeks to understand the effects that the partial lack (SOD2(-/+) ) or the overexpression (TgSOD2) of MnSOD produces on oxidative/nitrative stress basal levels in different brain isolated cellular fractions (i.e., mitochondrial, nuclear, cytosolic) as well as in the whole-brain homogenate. Furthermore, because of the known interaction between SOD2 and p53 protein, this study seeks to clarify the impact that the double mutation has on oxidative/nitrative stress levels in the brain of mice carrying the double mutation (p53(-/-) × SOD2(-/+) and p53(-/-) × TgSOD2). We show that each mutation affects mitochondrial, nuclear, and cytosolic oxidative/nitrative stress basal levels differently, but, overall, no change or reduction of oxidative/nitrative stress levels was found in the whole-brain homogenate. The analysis of well-known antioxidant systems such as thioredoxin-1 and Nrf2/HO-1/BVR-A suggests their potential role in the maintenance of the cellular redox homeostasis in the presence of changes of SOD2 and/or p53 protein levels. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
25759387	The Wnt Target Protein Peter Pan Defines a Novel p53-independent Nucleolar Stress-Response Pathway.	Pfister AS, Keil M, Kühl M.	Proper ribosome formation is a prerequisite for cell growth and proliferation. Failure of this process results in nucleolar stress and p53-mediated apoptosis. The Wnt target Peter Pan (PPAN) is required for 45 S rRNA maturation. So far, the role of PPAN in nucleolar stress response has remained elusive. We demonstrate that PPAN localizes to mitochondria in addition to its nucleolar localization and inhibits the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in a p53-independent manner. Loss of PPAN induces BAX stabilization, depolarization of mitochondria, and release of cytochrome c, demonstrating its important role as an anti-apoptotic factor. Staurosporine-induced nucleolar stress and apoptosis disrupt nucleolar PPAN localization and induce its accumulation in the cytoplasm. This is accompanied by phosphorylation and subsequent cleavage of PPAN by caspases. Moreover, we show that PPAN is a novel interaction partner of the anti-apoptotic protein nucleophosmin (NPM). PPAN depletion induces NPM and upstream-binding factor (UBF) degradation, which is independent of caspases. In summary, we provide evidence for a novel nucleolar stress-response pathway involving PPAN, NPM, and BAX to guarantee cell survival in a p53-independent manner.
25505174	Inhibition of polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) enhances the antineoplastic activity of metformin in prostate cancer.	Shao C, Ahmad N, Hodges K, Kuang S, Ratliff T, Liu X.	The widely used anti-diabetic drug metformin has been shown to exert strong antineoplastic actions in numerous tumor types, including prostate cancer (PCa). In this study, we show that BI2536, a specific Plk1 inhibitor, acted synergistically with metformin in inhibiting PCa cell proliferation. Furthermore, we also provide evidence that Plk1 inhibition makes PCa cells carrying WT p53 much more sensitive to low-dose metformin treatment. Mechanistically, we found that co-treatment with BI2536 and metformin induced p53-dependent apoptosis and further activated the p53/Redd-1 pathway. Moreover, we also show that BI2536 treatment inhibited metformin-induced glycolysis and glutamine anaplerosis, both of which are survival responses of cells against mitochondrial poisons. Finally, we confirmed the cell-based observations using both cultured cell-derived and patient-derived xenograft studies. Collectively, our findings support another promising therapeutic strategy by combining two well tolerated drugs against PCa proliferation and the progression of androgen-dependent PCa to the castration-resistant stage.
25605490	Association between p53 codon 72 (Arg72Pro) polymorphism and primary open-angle glaucoma in Iranian patients.	Neamatzadeh H, Soleimanizad R, Zare-Shehneh M, Gharibi S, Shekari A, Rahimzadeh AB.	BACKGROUND: Glaucomatous neuropathy is a type of cell death due to apoptosis. The p53 gene is one of the regulatory genes of apoptosis. Recently, the association between the p53 gene encoding for proline at codon 72 and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) has been studied in some ethnic groups. This study is the first association analysis of POAG and p53 codon 72 polymorphism in Iranian patients. METHODS: A cohort of 65 unrelated patients with POAG (age range from 12-62 years, mean ± SD of 40.16 ± 17.51 years) and 65 unrelated control subjects (without glaucoma, age range of 14-63 years, mean ± SD of 35.64 ± 13.61 years) were selected. In Iranian POAG patients and normal healthy controls, the p53 codon 72 polymorphism in exon 4 was amplified using polymerase chain reaction. The amplified DNA fragments were digested with the BstUI restriction enzyme, and the digestion patterns were used to identify the alleles for the polymorphic site. RESULTS: Comparisons revealed significant differences in allele and genotype frequencies of Pro72Arg between POAG patients and control group. A higher risk of POAG was associated with allele Pro (OR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.2-3.4) and genotype Pro/Pro (OR = 3.9, 95% CI = 0.13-12.7). CONCLUSION: The p53 Pro72 allele was more frequent in Iranian POAG patients than in the control group (P<0.05). The present findings show that the individuals with the Pro/Pro genotype may be more likely to develop POAG. However, additional studies are necessary to confirm this association.
25149900	Actin cytoskeleton organization, cell surface modification and invasion rate of 5 glioblastoma cell lines differing in PTEN and p53 status.	Djuzenova CS, Fiedler V, Memmel S, Katzer A, Hartmann S, Krohne G, Zimmermann H, Scholz CJ, Polat B, Flentje M, Sukhorukov VL.	Glioblastoma cells exhibit highly invasive behavior whose mechanisms are not yet fully understood. The present study explores the relationship between the invasion capacity of 5 glioblastoma cell lines differing in p53 and PTEN status, expression of mTOR and several other marker proteins involved in cell invasion, actin cytoskeleton organization and cell morphology. We found that two glioblastoma lines mutated in both p53 and PTEN genes (U373-MG and SNB19) exhibited the highest invasion rates through the Matrigel or collagen matrix. In DK-MG (p53wt/PTENwt) and GaMG (p53mut/PTENwt) cells, F-actin mainly occurred in the numerous stress fibers spanning the cytoplasm, whereas U87-MG (p53wt/PTENmut), U373-MG and SNB19 (both p53mut/PTENmut) cells preferentially expressed F-actin in filopodia and lamellipodia. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the abundant filopodia and lamellipodia in the PTEN mutated cell lines. Interestingly, the gene profiling analysis revealed two clusters of cell lines, corresponding to the most (U373-MG and SNB19, i.e. p53 and PTEN mutated cells) and less invasive phenotypes. The results of this study might shed new light on the mechanisms of glioblastoma invasion.
25253740	A p53/ARF-dependent anticancer barrier activates senescence and blocks tumorigenesis without impacting apoptosis.	Sinha VC, Qin L, Li Y.	In response to oncogene activation and oncogene-induced aberrant proliferation, mammalian cells activate apoptosis and senescence, usually via the p53-ARF tumor-suppressor pathway. Apoptosis is a known barrier to cancer and is usually downregulated before full malignancy, but senescence as an anticancer barrier is controversial due to its presence in the tumor environment. In addition, senescence may aid cancer progression via releasing senescence-associated factors that instigate neighboring tumor cells. Here, it is demonstrated that apoptosis unexpectedly remains robust in ErbB2 (ERBB2/HER2)-initiated mammary early lesions arising in adult mice null for either p53 or ARF. These early lesions, however, downregulate senescence significantly. This diminished senescence response is associated with accelerated progression to cancer in ARF-null mice compared with ARF-wild-type mice. Thus, the ARF-p53 pathway is dispensable for the apoptosis anticancer barrier in the initiation of ErbB2 breast cancer, the apoptosis barrier alone cannot halt mammary tumorigenesis, and senescence is a key barrier against carcinogenesis.Findings in this relevant mouse model of HER2-driven breast cancer suggest that effective prevention relies upon preserving both ARF/p53-independent apoptosis and ARF/p53-dependent senescence.
26181229	Cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induced by aspidin PB through the p53/p21 and mitochondria-dependent pathways in human osteosarcoma cells.	Wan D, Jiang C, Hua X, Wang T, Chai Y.	Aspidin PB is a natural product extracted from Dryopteris fragrans (L.) Schott, which has been characterized for its various biological activities. We reported that aspidin PB induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through the p53/p21 and mitochondria-dependent pathways in human osteosarcoma cells. Aspidin PB inhibited the proliferation of Saos-2, U2OS, and HOS cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Aspidin PB induced changes in the cell cycle regulators (cyclin A, pRb, CDK2, p53, and p21), which caused cell cycle arrest in the S phase. We also explored the role of siRNA targeted to p53; it led to a dose-dependent attenuation of aspidin PB-induced apoptosis signaling. Moreover, after treatment with aspidin PB, the p21-silenced cells decreased significantly at the S phase. Aspidin PB increased the percentage of cells with mitochondrial membrane potential disruption. Western blot analysis showed that aspidin PB inhibited Bcl-2 expression and induced Bax expression to disintegrate the outer mitochondrial membrane and caused cytochrome C release. Mitochondrial cytochrome C release was associated with the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 cascades. Furthermore, the double-stranded DNA breaks and reactive oxygen species signaling were both involved in aspidin PB-induced DNA damage. In addition, aspidin PB inhibited tumor growth significantly in U2OS xenografts. Above all, we conclude that aspidin PB represents a valuable natural source and may potentially be applicable in osteosarcoma therapy.
25840688	Genetic dissimilarity between primary colorectal carcinomas and their lymph node metastases: ploidy, p53, bcl-2, and c-myc expression--a pilot study.	Zalata KR, Elshal MF, Foda AA, Shoma A.	The current paradigm of metastasis proposes that rare cells within primary tumors acquire metastatic capability via sequential mutations, suggesting that metastases are genetically dissimilar from their primary tumors. This study investigated the changes in the level of expression of a well-defined panel of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis markers between the primary colorectal cancer (CRC) and the corresponding synchronous lymph node (LN) metastasis from the same patients. DNA flow cytometry and immunostaining of p53, bcl-2, and c-myc were carried out on 36 cases of CRC radical resection specimens with their corresponding LN metastases. There was very low probability that the histological patterns of primary tumors and LN metastases are independent (p < 0.001). Metastatic tumors were significantly more diffusely positive for p53 than the primary tumors (p < 0.001). Conversely, primary tumors were significantly more diffusely positive for c-myc than metastatic tumors (p = 0.011). No significant difference was found between the LNs and the primary tumors in bcl-2 positivity (p = 0.538) and DNA aneuploidy (p = 0.35), with a tendency towards negative bcl-2 and less aneuploidy in LN metastases than primary tumors. In conclusion, LN metastatic colorectal carcinomas have a tendency of being less differentiated, with a higher incidence of diffuse p53 staining, lower incidence of bcl-2 staining, and less aneuploidy in comparison to their primary counterparts suggesting a more aggressive biological behavior, which could indicate the necessity for more aggressive adjuvant therapy.
25675191	Dysregulation of CDK inhibitors and p53 in HPV-negative endocervical adenocarcinoma.	Omori M, Hashi A, Kondo T, Katoh R, Hirata S.	Human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative adenocarcinoma (AC) is a minor subset of endocervical cancer, but its pathogenesis has yet to be elucidated. This study investigated the clinicopathologic features of HPV-negative endocervical AC (n=14) in comparison with HPV-positive endocervical AC (n=30), and further studied aberrations of cell-cycle regulators. Expression patterns of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (p16, p14, p27, and p21) and p53 were evaluated immunohistochemically, and nuclear high-risk HPV DNA signals were detected by in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction. Immunoexpression of p16, p14, p27, p21, and p53 were observed in 90%, 67%, 77%, 40%, and 20% of HPV-positive ACs, and in 0%, 0%, 29%, 14%, and 57% of HPV-negative ACs, respectively. A higher frequency of lymph node metastasis and worse prognosis were significantly associated with HPV-negative AC. Our findings suggest that alteration of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and p53 status may contribute to carcinogenesis and the clinical behavior of HPV-negative AC of the uterine cervix.
26578795	Amino-terminal p53 mutations lead to expression of apoptosis proficient p47 and prognosticate better survival, but predispose to tumorigenesis.	Phang BH, Othman R, Bougeard G, Chia RH, Frebourg T, Tang CL, Cheah PY, Sabapathy K.	Whereas most mutations in p53 occur in the DNA-binding domain and lead to its functional inactivation, their relevance in the amino-terminal transactivation domain is unclear. We show here that amino-terminal p53 (ATp53) mutations often result in the abrogation of full-length p53 expression, but concomitantly lead to the expression of the amino-terminally truncated p47 isoform. Using genetically modified cancer cells that only express p47, we demonstrate it to be up-regulated in response to various stimuli, and to contribute to cell death, through its ability to selectively activate a group of apoptotic target genes. Target gene selectivity is influenced by K382 acetylation, which depends on the amino terminus, and is required for recruitment of selective cofactors. Consistently, cancers capable of expressing p47 had a better overall survival. Nonetheless, retention of the apoptotic function appears insufficient for tumor suppression, because these mutations are also found in the germ line and lead to Li-Fraumeni syndrome. These data from ATp53 mutations collectively demonstrate that p53's apoptosis proficiency is dispensable for tumor suppression, but could prognosticate better survival.
26578792	Chronic centrosome amplification without tumorigenesis.	Vitre B, Holland AJ, Kulukian A, Shoshani O, Hirai M, Wang Y, Maldonado M, Cho T, Boubaker J, Swing DA, Tessarollo L, Evans SM, Fuchs E, Cleveland DW.	Centrosomes are microtubule-organizing centers that facilitate bipolar mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome segregation. Recognizing that centrosome amplification is a common feature of aneuploid cancer cells, we tested whether supernumerary centrosomes are sufficient to drive tumor development. To do this, we constructed and analyzed mice in which centrosome amplification can be induced by a Cre-recombinase-mediated increase in expression of Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4). Elevated Plk4 in mouse fibroblasts produced supernumerary centrosomes and enhanced the expected mitotic errors, but proliferation continued only after inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor. Increasing Plk4 levels in mice with functional p53 produced centrosome amplification in liver and skin, but this did not promote spontaneous tumor development in these tissues or enhance the growth of chemically induced skin tumors. In the absence of p53, Plk4 overexpression generated widespread centrosome amplification, but did not drive additional tumors or affect development of the fatal thymic lymphomas that arise in animals lacking p53. We conclude that, independent of p53 status, supernumerary centrosomes are not sufficient to drive tumor formation.
26573366	DNA damage induced by boron neutron capture therapy is partially repaired by DNA ligase IV.	Kondo N, Sakurai Y, Hirota Y, Tanaka H, Watanabe T, Nakagawa Y, Narabayashi M, Kinashi Y, Miyatake SI, Hasegawa M, Suzuki M, Masunaga SI, Ohnishi T, Ono K.	Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a particle radiation therapy that involves the use of a thermal or epithermal neutron beam in combination with a boron ((10)B)-containing compound that specifically accumulates in tumor. (10)B captures neutrons and the resultant fission reaction produces an alpha ((4)He) particle and a recoiled lithium nucleus ((7)Li). These particles have the characteristics of high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation and therefore have marked biological effects. High-LET radiation is a potent inducer of DNA damage, specifically of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The aim of the present study was to clarify the role of DNA ligase IV, a key player in the non-homologous end-joining repair pathway, in the repair of BNCT-induced DSBs. We analyzed the cellular sensitivity of the mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines Lig4-/- p53-/- and Lig4+/+ p53-/- to irradiation using a thermal neutron beam in the presence or absence of (10)B-para-boronophenylalanine (BPA). The Lig4-/- p53-/- cell line had a higher sensitivity than the Lig4+/+ p53-/-cell line to irradiation with the beam alone or the beam in combination with BPA. In BNCT (with BPA), both cell lines exhibited a reduction of the 50 % survival dose (D 50) by a factor of 1.4 compared with gamma-ray and neutron mixed beam (without BPA). Although it was found that (10)B uptake was higher in the Lig4+/+ p53-/- than in the Lig4-/- p53-/- cell line, the latter showed higher sensitivity than the former, even when compared at an equivalent (10)B concentration. These results indicate that BNCT-induced DNA damage is partially repaired using DNA ligase IV.
26592447	p53 mutations cooperate with oncogenic Kras to promote adenocarcinoma from pancreatic ductal cells.	Bailey JM, Hendley AM, Lafaro KJ, Pruski MA, Jones NC, Alsina J, Younes M, Maitra A, McAllister F, Iacobuzio-Donahue CA, Leach SD.	Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies, with virtually all patients eventually succumbing to their disease. Mutations in p53 have been documented in >50% of pancreatic cancers. Owing to the high incidence of p53 mutations in PanIN 3 lesions and pancreatic tumors, we interrogated the comparative ability of adult pancreatic acinar and ductal cells to respond to oncogenic Kras and mutant Tp53(R172H) using Hnf1b:CreER(T2) and Mist1:CreER(T2) mice. These studies involved co-activation of a membrane-tethered GFP lineage label, allowing for direct visualization and isolation of cells undergoing Kras and mutant p53 activation. Kras activation in Mist1(+) adult acinar cells resulted in brisk PanIN formation, whereas no evidence of pancreatic neoplasia was observed for up to 6 months following Kras activation in Hnf1beta(+) adult ductal cells. In contrast to the lack of response to oncogenic Kras alone, simultaneous activation of Kras and mutant p53 in adult ductal epithelium generated invasive PDAC in 75% of mice as early as 2.5 months after tamoxifen administration. These data demonstrate that pancreatic ductal cells, whereas exhibiting relative resistance to oncogenic Kras alone, can serve as an effective cell of origin for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in the setting of gain-of-function mutations in p53.Oncogene advance online publication, 23 November 2015; doi:10.1038/onc.2015.441.
26545781	Del-1 overexpression potentiates lung cancer cell proliferation and invasion.	Lee SH, Kim DY, Jing F, Kim H, Yun CO, Han DJ, Choi EY.	Developmental endothelial locus-1 (Del-1) is an endogenous anti-inflammatory molecule that is highly expressed in the lung and the brain and limits leukocyte migration to these tissues. We previously reported that the expression of Del-1 is positively regulated by p53 in lung endothelial cells. Although several reports have implicated the altered expression of Del-1 gene in cancer patients, little is known about its role in tumor cells. We here investigated the effect of Del-1 on the features of human lung carcinoma cells. Del-1 mRNA was found to be significantly decreased in the human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines A549 (containing wild type of p53), H1299 (null for p53) and EKVX (mutant p53), compared to in human normal lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells and MRC-5 fibroblasts. The decrease of Del-1 expression was dependent on the p53 activity in the cell lines, but not on the expression of p53. Neither treatment with recombinant human Del-1 protein nor the introduction of adenovirus expressing Del-1 altered the expression of the apoptosis regulators BAX, PUMA and Bcl-2. Unexpectedly, the adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Del-1 gene into the lung carcinoma cell lines promoted proliferation and invasion of the lung carcinoma cells, as revealed by BrdU incorporation and transwell invasion assays, respectively. In addition, overexpression of the Del-1 gene enhanced features of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), such as increasing vimentin while decreasing E-cadherin in A549 cells, and increases in the level of Slug, an EMT-associated transcription regulator. Our findings demonstrated for the first time that there are deleterious effects of high levels of Del-1 in lung carcinoma cells, and suggest that Del-1 may be used as a diagnostic or prognostic marker for cancer progression, and as a novel therapeutic target for lung carcinoma.
26340092	Negative Regulation of p21Waf1/Cip1 by Human INO80 Chromatin Remodeling Complex Is Implicated in Cell Cycle Phase G2/M Arrest and Abnormal Chromosome Stability.	Cao L, Ding J, Dong L, Zhao J, Su J, Wang L, Sui Y, Zhao T, Wang F, Jin J, Cai Y.	We previously identified an ATP-dependent human Ino80 (INO80) chromatin remodeling complex which shares a set of core subunits with yeast Ino80 complex. Although research evidence has suggested that INO80 complex functions in gene transcription and genome stability, the precise mechanism remains unclear. Herein, based on gene expression profiles from the INO80 complex-knockdown in HeLa cells, we first demonstrate that INO80 complex negatively regulates the p21Waf1/Cip1 (p21) expression in a p53-mediated mechanism. In chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and a sequential ChIP (Re-ChIP) assays, we determined that the INO80 complex and p53 can bind to the same promoter region of p21 gene (-2.2 kb and -1.0 kb upstream of the p21 promoter region), and p53 is required for the recruitment of the INO80 complex to the p21 promoter. RNAi knockdown strategies of INO80 not only led to prolonged progression of cell cycle phase G2/M to G1, but it also resulted in abnormal chromosome stability. Interestingly, high expression of p21 was observed in most morphologically-changed cells, suggesting that negative regulation of p21 by INO80 complex might be implicated in maintaining the cell cycle process and chromosome stability. Together, our findings will provide a theoretical basis to further elucidate the cellular mechanisms of the INO80 complex.
26156217	A Biomimic Reconstituted High-Density-Lipoprotein-Based Drug and p53 Gene Co-delivery System for Effective Antiangiogenesis Therapy of Bladder Cancer.	Ouyang Q, Duan Z, Jiao G, Lei J.	A biomimic reconstituted high-density-lipoprotein-based drug and p53 gene co-delivery system (rHDL/CD-PEI/p53 complexes) was fabricated as a targeted co-delivery nanovector of drug and gene for potential bladder cancer therapy. Here, CD-PEI was utilized to effectively condense the p53 plasmid, to incorporate the plasmid into rHDL, and to act as an antitumor drug to suppress tumor angiogenesis. The rHDL/CD-PEI/p53 complexes exhibited desirable and homogenous particle size, neutral surface charge, and low cytotoxicity in vitro. The results of confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry confirmed that SR-BI-targeted function induced specific cytoplasmic delivery and high gene transfection efficiency in MBT-2 murine bladder cells. In addition, rHDL/CD-PEI/p53 complexes co-delivering CD and p53 gene achieved synergistic angiogenesis suppression by more effectively downregulating the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein via different pathways in vitro. In vivo investigation on C3H/He mice bearing MBT-2 tumor xenografts revealed that rHDL/CD-PEI/p53 complexes possessed strong antitumor activity. These findings suggested that rHDL/CD-PEI/p53 complexes could be an ideal tumor-targeting system for simultaneous transfer of drug and gene, which might be a new promising strategy for effective bladder cancer therapy.
25866679	Caspase Activation and Aberrant Cell Growth in a p53(+/+) Cell Line from a Li-Fraumeni Syndrome Family.	Sherif ZA.	Wild-type p53 is well known to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis to block aberrant cell growth. However, p53's unique role in apoptosis and cell proliferation in Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) has not been well elucidated. The aim of this study is to characterize the activity of wild-type p53 protein in LFS family dominated by a germline negative mutant p53. As expected, etoposide-treated wild-type p53-containing cell lines, LFS 2852 and control Jurkat, showed a greater rate of caspase- and annexin V-induced apoptotic cell death compared to the p53-mutant LFS 2673 cell line although mitochondrial and nuclear assays could not detect apoptosis in these organelles. The most intriguing part of the observation was the abnormal proliferation rate of the wild-type p53-containing cell line, which grew twice as fast as 2673 and Jurkat cells. This is important because apoptosis inducers acting through the mitochondrial death pathway are emerging as promising drugs against tumors where the role of p53 is not only to target gene regulation but also to block cell proliferation. This study casts a long shadow on the possible dysregulation of p53 mediators that enable cell proliferation. The deregulation of proliferation pathways represents an important anticancer therapeutic strategy for patients with the LFS phenotype.
25738595	All-trans-retinoic acid inhibits chondrogenesis of rat embryo hindlimb bud mesenchymal cells by downregulating p53 expression.	Zhang TG, Li XD, Yu GY, Xie P, Wang YG, Liu ZY, Hong Q, Liu DZ, Du SX.	Despite the well-established role of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) in congenital clubfoot (CCF)-like deformities in in vivo models, the essential cellular and molecular targets and the signaling mechanisms for ATRA-induced CCF-like deformities remain to be elucidated. Recent studies have demonstrated that p53 and p21, expressed in the hindlimb bud mesenchyme, regulate cellular proliferation and differentiation, contributing to a significant proportion of embryonic CCF-like abnormalities. The objective of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms for ATRA-induced CCF, by assessing ATRA-regulated chondrogenesis in rat embryo hindlimb bud mesenchymal cells (rEHBMCs) in vitro. The experimental study was based on varying concentrations of ATRA exposure on embryonic day 12.5 rEHBMCs in vitro. The present study demonstrated that ATRA inhibited the proliferation of cells by stimulating apoptotic cell death of rEHBMCs. It was also observed that ATRA induced a dose-dependent reduction of cartilage nodules compared with the control group. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting assays revealed that the mRNA and protein expression of cartilage-specific molecules, including aggrecan, Sox9 and collagen, type II, α 1 (Col2a1), were downregulated by ATRA in a dose-dependent manner; the mRNA levels of p53 and p21 were dose-dependently upregulated from 16 to 20 h of incubation with ATRA, but dose-dependently downregulated from 24 to 48 h. Of note, p53 and p21 were regulated at the translational level in parallel with the transcription with rEHBMCs treated with ATRA. Furthermore, the immunofluorescent microscopy assays indicated that proteins of p53 and p21 were predominantly expressed in the cartilage nodules. The present study demonstrated that ATRA decreases the chondrogenesis of rEHBMCs by inhibiting cartilage-specific molecules, including aggrecan, Sox9 and Col2al, via regulating the expression of p53 and p21.
26379910	p53 mediated apoptosis in osteosarcoma MG-63 cells by inhibition of FANCD2 gene expression.	Xia P, Sun Y, Zheng C, Hou T, Kang M, Yang X.	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between osteosarcoma (OS) and Fanconi anemia (FA) related pathways and the molecular mechanisms. METHODS: siRNA for Fanconi anemia complementation group D2 (FANCD2) was constructed and transfected into the osteosarcoma cell line MG-63 cells. Expression of TP53INP1, p53, p21, caspase-9, and caspase-3 mRNA in MG-63 cells were examined by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR, and the protein levels were also determined by western blot. RESULTS: After silence of the FANCD2 gene in MG-63 cells, cell proliferation was inhibited, cell cycle was arrested and cell apoptosis was induced. The apoptosis was mediated by the p53 signaling pathway. After FANCD2 expression was inhibited, TP53INP1 gene expression was up-regulated, phosphorylation of p53 was promoted and the p21 protein was activated, leading to cell cycle arrested in G1, finally resulted in caspase-dependent cell apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of FANCD2 gene expression can induce apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells, which indicated that FANCD2 played an important role in the development of osteosarcoma and it might be a potential target for treatment of osteosarcoma.
25663867	Liriodenine induces the apoptosis of human laryngocarcinoma cells via the upregulation of p53 expression.	Li L, Xu Y, Wang B.	Laryngocarcinoma is one of the most aggressive cancers that affects the head and neck region. The survival rate of patients with laryngocarcinoma is low due to late metastases and the resistance of the disease to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Liriodenine, an alkaloid extracted from a number of plant species, has demonstrated antitumor effects on multiple types of cancer. However, the effects of liriodenine upon laryngocarcinoma, and the underlying mechanisms, are yet to be elucidated. The present study therefore investigated the potential antitumor effects of liriodenine on HEp-2 human laryngocarcinoma cells in vitro and HEp-2-implanted nude mice in vivo. Liriodenine induced significant apoptosis and inhibition of cell migration in the HEp-2 cells. Furthermore, the rate of tumor growth in the HEp-2-implanted nude mice was inhibited by the administration of liriodenine. The potential mechanism underlying the antitumor effects of liriodenine may result from an upregulative effect upon p53 expression, which ultimately induces cellular apoptosis. By contrast, the downregulation of p53 significantly reduced the antitumor effects of liriodenine. Together, these results suggest that liriodenine exhibits potent antitumor activities in laryngocarcinoma HEp-2 cells, in vitro and in vivo, via the upregulation of p53 expression. Liriodenine may therefore be a potential therapy for the treatment of laryngocarcinoma.
25704882	Sumoylation of HDAC2 promotes NF-κB-dependent gene expression.	Wagner T, Kiweler N, Wolff K, Knauer SK, Brandl A, Hemmerich P, Dannenberg JH, Heinzel T, Schneider G, Krämer OH.	The transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is crucial for the maintenance of homeostasis. It is incompletely understood how nuclear NF-κB and the crosstalk of NF-κB with other transcription factors are controlled. Here, we demonstrate that the epigenetic regulator histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) activates NF-κB in transformed and primary cells. This function depends on both, the catalytic activity and an intact HDAC2 sumoylation motif. Several mechanisms account for the induction of NF-κB through HDAC2. The expression of wild-type HDAC2 can increase the nuclear presence of NF-κB. In addition, the ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (RSK1) and the tumor suppressor p53 contribute to the regulation of NF-κB by HDAC2. Moreover, TP53 mRNA expression is positively regulated by wild-type HDAC2 but not by sumoylation-deficient HDAC2. Thus, sumoylation of HDAC2 integrates NF-κB signaling involving p53 and RSK1. Since HDAC2-dependent NF-κB activity protects colon cancer cells from genotoxic stress, our data also suggest that high HDAC2 levels, which are frequently found in tumors, are linked to chemoresistance. Accordingly, inhibitors of NF-κB and of the NF-κB/p53-regulated anti-apoptotic protein survivin significantly sensitize colon carcinoma cells expressing wild-type HDAC2 to apoptosis induced by the genotoxin doxorubicin. Hence, the HDAC2-dependent signaling node we describe here may offer an interesting therapeutic option.
25897952	Modulation of the disordered conformational ensembles of the p53 transactivation domain by cancer-associated mutations.	Ganguly D, Chen J.	Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are frequently associated with human diseases such as cancers, and about one-fourth of disease-associated missense mutations have been mapped into predicted disordered regions. Understanding how these mutations affect the structure-function relationship of IDPs is a formidable task that requires detailed characterization of the disordered conformational ensembles. Implicit solvent coupled with enhanced sampling has been proposed to provide a balance between accuracy and efficiency necessary for systematic and comparative assessments of the effects of mutations as well as post-translational modifications on IDP structure and interaction. Here, we utilize a recently developed replica exchange with guided annealing enhanced sampling technique to calculate well-converged atomistic conformational ensembles of the intrinsically disordered transactivation domain (TAD) of tumor suppressor p53 and several cancer-associated mutants in implicit solvent. The simulations are critically assessed by quantitative comparisons with several types of experimental data that provide structural information on both secondary and tertiary levels. The results show that the calculated ensembles reproduce local structural features of wild-type p53-TAD and the effects of K24N mutation quantitatively. On the tertiary level, the simulated ensembles are overly compact, even though they appear to recapitulate the overall features of transient long-range contacts qualitatively. A key finding is that, while p53-TAD and its cancer mutants sample a similar set of conformational states, cancer mutants could introduce both local and long-range structural modulations to potentially perturb the balance of p53 binding to various regulatory proteins and further alter how this balance is regulated by multisite phosphorylation of p53-TAD. The current study clearly demonstrates the promise of atomistic simulations for detailed characterization of IDP conformations, and at the same time reveals important limitations in the current implicit solvent protein force field that must be sufficiently addressed for reliable description of long-range structural features of the disordered ensembles.
25547493	USP22 promotes NSCLC tumorigenesis via MDMX up-regulation and subsequent p53 inhibition.	Ding F, Bao C, Tian Y, Xiao H, Wang M, Xie X, Hu F, Mei J.	Increasing evidence suggests that ubiquitin-specific protease 22 (USP22) has great clinicopathologic significance in oncology. In this study, we investigated the role of USP22 in human NSCLC tumorigenesis along with the underlying mechanisms of action. First, we determined the expression of USP22 in human NSCLC, as well as normal tissues and cell lines. We then studied the effects of USP22 silencing by shRNA on NSCLC cell growth in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo, along with the effect on the p53 pathway. We found that USP22 is overexpressed in human NSCLC tissues and cell lines. USP22 silencing by shRNA inhibits proliferation, induces apoptosis and arrests cells at the G0/G1 phases in NSCLC cells and curbs human NSCLC tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. Additionally, USP22 silencing downregulates MDMX protein expression and activates the p53 pathway. Our co-immunoprecipitation analysis shows that USP22 interacts with MDMX in NSCLC cells. Furthermore, MDMX silencing leads to growth arrest and apoptosis in NSCLC cells, and over-expression of MDMX reverses the USP22 silencing-induced effects. Taken together, our results suggest that USP22 promotes NSCLC tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo through MDMX upregulation and subsequent p53 inhibition. USP22 may represent a novel target for NSCLC treatment.
26412380	ARF: Connecting senescence and innate immunity for clearance.	Kearney AY, Anchang B, Plevritis S, Felsher DW.	We have found evidence suggesting that ARF and p53 are essential for tumor regression upon MYC inactivation through distinct mechanisms ARF through p53-independent affect, is required to for MYC to regulate the expression of genes that are required for both the induction of cellular senescence as well as recruitment of innate immune activation. Our observations have possible implications for mechanisms of therapeutic resistance to targeted oncogene inactivation.
26221232	MiR-300 regulate the malignancy of breast cancer by targeting p53.	Xu XH, Li DW, Feng H, Chen HM, Song YQ.	OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the role of miR-300 in regulating cell proliferation and invasion of breast cancer (BC) cells. METHODS: MicroRNA and protein expression patterns were compared between breast cancer tissue and normal tissue and between two different prognostic groups. The up-regulation of miR-300 was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and its expression was analyzed in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. RESULTS: We observed that miR-300 expression was frequently and dramatically up-regulated in human breast cancer tissues and cell lines compared with the matched adjacent normal tissues and cells. We further showed that transient and stable over-expression of miR-300 could promote cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. Moreover, p53, a key inhibitor of cell cycle, was verified as a direct target of miR-300, suggesting that miR-300 might promote breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion by regulating p53 expression. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that miR-300 up-regulation might exert some sort of antagonistic function by targeting p53 in breast cancer cell proliferation during breast tumorigenesis.
25845528	Hypermethylation of the tumor-suppressor cell adhesion molecule 1 in human papillomavirus-transformed cervical carcinoma cells.	Woo HJ, Kim SJ, Song KJ, Kim SS, Yoon CH, Choi BS, Rhee JE.	Epigenetic modification at CpG islands located on the promoter regions of tumor-suppressor genes has been associated with tumor development in many human cancers. Our study showed that the cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) is downregulated in human papillomavirus (HPV)-infected cervical cancer cell lines via its hypermethylation and demethylation using 5-aza-2'-deoxycyticine (5-aza-dC) restored the expression of CADM1 protein. Overexpression of CADM1 inhibited cell proliferation. p53 was involved in the regulation of CADM1. Our results demonstrate that epigenetic alteration of CADM1 was more frequent in HPV-positive cervical cancers and that restoration of CADM1 expression may be a potential strategy for cervical cancer therapy.
26019375	SCGB3A2 Inhibits Acrolein-Induced Apoptosis through Decreased p53 Phosphorylation.	Kurotani R, Shima R, Miyano Y, Sakahara S, Matsumoto Y, Shibata Y, Abe H, Kimura S.	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a major global health problem with increasing morbidity and mortality rates, is anticipated to become the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2020. COPD arises from exposure to cigarette smoke. Acrolein, which is contained in cigarette smoke, is the most important risk factor for COPD. It causes lung injury through altering apoptosis and causes inflammation by augmenting p53 phosphorylation and producing reactive oxygen species (ROS). Secretoglobin (SCGB) 3A2, a secretory protein predominantly present in the epithelial cells of the lungs and trachea, is a cytokine-like small molecule having anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, and growth factor activities. In this study, the effect of SCGB3A2 on acrolein-related apoptosis was investigated using the mouse fibroblast cell line MLg as the first step in determining the possible therapeutic value of SCGB3A2 in COPD. Acrolein increased the production of ROS and phosphorylation of p53 and induced apoptosis in MLg cells. While the extent of ROS production induced by acrolein was not affected by SCGB3A2, p53 phosphorylation was significantly decreased by SCGB3A2. These results demonstrate that SCGB3A2 inhibited acrolein-induced apoptosis through decreased p53 phosphorylation, not altered ROS levels.
26089934	The Flavonoid Apigenin Ameliorates Cisplatin-Induced Nephrotoxicity through Reduction of p53 Activation and Promotion of PI3K/Akt Pathway in Human Renal Proximal Tubular Epithelial Cells.	Ju SM, Kang JG, Bae JS, Pae HO, Lyu YS, Jeon BH.	Apigenin is a member of the flavone subclass of flavonoids present in fruits and vegetables. Apigenin has long been considered to have various biological activities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antitumorigenic properties, in various cell types. Cisplatin was known to exhibit cytotoxic effect to renal cells by inducing apoptosis through activation of p53. The present study investigated the antiapoptotic effects of apigenin on the cisplatin-treated human renal proximal tubular epithelial (HK-2) cells. HK-2 cells were pretreated with apigenin (5, 10, 20 μM) for 1 h and then treated with 40 μM cisplatin for various times. Apigenin inhibited the cisplatin-induced apoptosis of HK-2 cells. Interestingly, apigenin itself exerted cytostatic activity because of its ability to induce cell cycle arrest. Apigenin inhibited caspase-3 activity and PARP cleavage in cisplatin-treated cells. Apigenin reduced cisplatin-induced phosphorylation and expression of p53, with no significant influence on production of ROS that is known to induce p53 activation. Furthermore, apigenin promoted cisplatin-induced Akt phosphorylation, suggesting that enhanced Akt activation may be involved in cytoprotection. Taken together, these results suggest that apigenin ameliorates cisplatin-induced apoptosis through reduction of p53 activation and promotion of PI3K/Akt pathway in HK-2 cells.
25506925	Functional interaction between cyclooxygenase-2 and p53 in response to an endogenous electrophile.	Kumagai T, Usami H, Matsukawa N, Nakashima F, Chikazawa M, Shibata T, Noguchi N, Uchida K.	Cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) is rapidly expressed by various stimuli and plays a key role in conversion of free arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. We have previously identified 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), a lipid peroxidation-derived electrophile, as the potent Cox-2 inducer in rat epithelial RL34 cells and revealed that the HNE-induced Cox-2 expression resulted from the stabilization of Cox-2 mRNA that is mediated by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. In the present study, we investigated an alternative regulatory mechanism of Cox-2 expression mediated by a transcription factor p53. In addition, to characterize the causal role for Cox-2, we examined the effects of Cox-2 overexpression in RL34 cells. To examine whether the HNE-induced Cox-2 expression was mechanistically linked to the p53 expression, we analyzed changes in Cox-2 and p53 expression levels in response to HNE and observed that the Cox-2 levels were inversely correlated with the p53 levels. Down-regulation of p53 followed by the activation of a transcription factor Sp1 was suggested to be involved in the HNE-induced Cox-2 gene expression. To characterize the effect of Cox-2 expression in the cells, we established the Cox-2-overexpressing derivatives of RL34 cells by stable transfection with Cox-2 cDNA. An oligonucleotide microarray analysis revealed a dramatic down-regulation of the proteasome subunit RC1 in the Cox-2 overexpressed cells compared to the empty-vector transfected control cells. Consistent with the Cox-2-mediated down-regulation of proteasome, a moderate reduction of the proteasome activities was observed. This proteasome dysfunction mediated by the Cox-2 overproduction was associated with the enhanced accumulation of p53 and ubiquitinated proteins, leading to the enhanced sensitivity toward electrophiles. These results suggest the existence of a causal link between Cox-2 and p53, which may represent a toxic mechanism of electrophilic lipid peroxidation products.
25980493	Nuclear EGFR impairs ASPP2-p53 complex-induced apoptosis by inducing SOS1 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma.	Liu K, Jiang T, Ouyang Y, Shi Y, Zang Y, Li N, Lu S, Chen D.	ASPP2 can bind to p53 and enhance the apoptotic capabilities of p53 by guiding it to the promoters of pro-apoptotic genes. Here, ASPP2 overexpression for 24 hours transiently induced apoptosis in hepatoma cells by enhancing the transactivation of p53 on pro-apoptotic gene promoters. However, long-term ASPP2 overexpression (more than 48 hours) failed to induce apoptosis because p53 was released from the pro-apoptotic gene promoters. In non-apoptotic cells, nuclear EGFR induced SOS1 expression by directly binding to the SOS1 promoter. SOS1 activated the HRAS/PI3K/AKT pathway and resulted in nuclear translocation of p-AKT and Bcl-2. The interaction between p-AKT and ASPP2 facilitates Bcl-2 binding to p53, which releases p53 from the pro-apoptotic gene promoters. The in vivo assay demonstrated that EGFR/SOS1-promoted growth of nuclear p-AKT+, Bcl-2+ cells results in the resistance of hepatoma cells to ASPP2-p53 complex-induced apoptosis and that blocking nuclear translocation of EGFR dramatically improves and enhances the pro-apoptotic function of ASPP2. Finally, the activation of the HRAS/PI3K/AKT pathway by EGFR-induced SOS1 also inhibits cisplatin-induced apoptosis, suggesting a common apoptosis-evasion mechanism in hepatoma cells. Because evasion of apoptosis contributes to treatment resistance in hepatoma, our results also support further investigation of combined therapeutic blockade of EGFR and SOS1.
26151636	Intracellular Analysis of the Interaction between the Human Papillomavirus Type 16 E6 Oncoprotein and Inhibitory Peptides.	Stutz C, Reinz E, Honegger A, Bulkescher J, Schweizer J, Zanier K, Travé G, Lohrey C, Hoppe-Seyler K, Hoppe-Seyler F.	Oncogenic types of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) cause cervical cancer and other malignancies in humans. The HPV E6 oncoprotein is considered to be an attractive therapeutic target since its inhibition can lead to the apoptotic cell death of HPV-positive cancer cells. The HPV type 16 (HPV16) E6-binding peptide pep11, and variants thereof, induce cell death specifically in HPV16-positive cancer cells. Although they do not encompass the LxxLL binding motif found in cellular HPV16 E6 interaction partners, such as E6AP, the pep11 variants strongly bind to HPV16 E6 by contacting the recently identified E6AP binding pocket. Thus, these peptides can serve as prototype E6-inhibitory molecules which target the E6AP pocket. We here analyzed their intracellular interaction with HPV16 E6. By comprehensive intracellular binding studies and GST pull-down assays, we show that E6-binding competent pep11 variants induce the formation of a trimeric complex, consisting of pep11, HPV16 E6 and p53. These findings indicate that peptides, which do not contain the LxxLL motif, can reshape E6 to enable its interaction with p53. The formation of the trimeric HPV16 E6 / peptide / p53 complex was associated with an increase of endogenous HPV16 E6 protein amounts. Yet, total cellular p53 amounts were also increased, indicating that the E6 / E6AP-mediated degradation of p53 is blocked. These findings suggest that inhibition of oncogenic activities by targeting the E6AP pocket on HPV16 E6 could be a strategy for therapeutic intervention.
26380023	Up-regulation of HDAC9 promotes cell proliferation through suppressing p53 transcription in osteosarcoma.	Zhao YX, Wang YS, Cai QQ, Wang JQ, Yao WT.	Increasing studies have demonstrated that altered expression of histone deacetylases (HDACs) plays a critical role in the tumorigenesis through up-regulation or down-regulation of key genes involved in cell proliferation, cell-cycle regulation and apoptosis. In the present study, the expression and function of HDAC9 were investigated in osteosarcoma. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis found that HDAC9 was up-regulated in osteosarcoma tissues, when compared with that in adjacent normal tissues. In vitro studies further demonstrated that overexpression of HDAC9 in U2OS and MG63 cells promoted cell proliferation and invasion. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we found that HDAC9 epigenetically repressed p53 transcription through binding to its proximal promoter region. Therefore, our data suggest an important role for HDAC9/p53 regulatory pathway in the osteosarcoma progression.
25890228	Clinical outcome and expression of mutant P53, P16, and Smad4 in lung adenocarcinoma: a prospective study.	Bian C, Li Z, Xu Y, Wang J, Xu L, Shen H.	BACKGROUND: Whole-exome sequencing has shown that lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) can be driven by mutant genes, including TP53, P16, and Smad4. The aim of this study was to clarify protein alterations of P53, P16, and Smad4 and to explore their correlations between the protein alterations and clinical outcome. METHODS: We investigated associations among P53 mutant (P53(Mut)) expression, and P16 and Smad4 loss-of-expression, with clinical outcome in 120 LAC patients who underwent curative resection, using immunohistochemical (IHC) methods. RESULTS: Of the 120 patients, 76 (63.3%) expressed P53(Mut) protein, whereas 54 (45.0%) loss of P16 expressed and 75 (62.5%) loss of Smad4 expressed. P53(Mut) expression was associated with tumor size (P = 0.041) and pathological stage (P = 0.025). Loss of P16 expression was associated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.001) and pathological stage (P < 0.001). Loss of Smad4 expression was associated with tumor size (P = 0.033), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.014), pathological stage (P = 0.017), and tumor differentiation (P = 0.022). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that tumor size (P = 0.031), lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001), pathological stage (P < 0.001), P53(Mut) protein expression (P = 0.038), and loss of p16 or Smad4 expression (P < 0.001) were significantly associated with shorter overall survival(OS), whereas multivariate analysis indicated that lymph node metastasis (P = 0.014) and loss of p16 or Smad4 expression (P < 0.001) were independent prognostic factors. Analysis of protein combinations showed patients with more alterations had poorer survival (P < 0.001). Spearman correlation analysis showed that loss of Smad4 expression inversely correlated with expression of P53(Mut) (r = (-)0.196, P = 0.032) and positively with lost P16 expression (r =0.182, P = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that IHC status of P53(Mut), P16, and Smad4 may predict patient outcomes in LAC.
26056430	p53 Contributes to Differentiating Gene Expression Following Exposure to Acetaminophen and Its Less Hepatotoxic Regioisomer Both In Vitro and In Vivo.	Stamper BD, Garcia ML, Nguyen DQ, Beyer RP, Bammler TK, Farin FM, Kavanagh TJ, Nelson SD.	The goal of the present study was to compare hepatic toxicogenomic signatures across in vitro and in vivo mouse models following exposure to acetaminophen (APAP) or its relatively nontoxic regioisomer 3'-hydroxyacetanilide (AMAP). Two different Affymetrix microarray platforms and one Agilent Oligonucleotide microarray were utilized. APAP and AMAP treatments resulted in significant and large changes in gene expression that were quite disparate, and likely related to their different toxicologic profiles. Ten transcripts, all of which have been implicated in p53 signaling, were identified as differentially regulated at all time-points following APAP and AMAP treatments across multiple microarray platforms. Protein-level quantification of p53 activity aligned with results from the transcriptomic analysis, thus supporting the implicated mechanism of APAP-induced toxicity. Therefore, the results of this study provide good evidence that APAP-induced p53 phosphorylation and an altered p53-driven transcriptional response are fundamental steps in APAP-induced toxicity.
25773675	CHIP stabilizes amyloid precursor protein via proteasomal degradation and p53-mediated trans-repression of β-secretase.	Singh AK, Pati U.	In patient with Alzheimer's disease (AD), deposition of amyloid-beta Aβ, a proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase/BACE1, forms senile plaque in the brain. BACE1 activation is caused due to oxidative stresses and dysfunction of ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which is linked to p53 inactivation. As partial suppression of BACE1 attenuates Aβ generation and AD-related pathology, it might be an ideal target for AD treatment. We have shown that both in neurons and in HEK-APP cells, BACE1 is a new substrate of E3-ligase CHIP and an inverse relation exists between CHIP and BACE1 level. CHIP inhibits ectopic BACE1 level by promoting its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thus reducing APP processing; it stabilizes APP in neurons, thus reducing Aβ. CHIP(U) (box) domain physically interacts with BACE1; however, both U-box and TPR domain are essential for ubiquitination and degradation of BACE1. Further, BACE1 is a downstream target of p53 and overexpression of p53 decreases BACE1 level. In HEK-APP cells, CHIP is shown to negatively regulate BACE1 promoter through stabilization of p53's DNA-binding conformation and its binding upon 5' UTR element (+127 to +150). We have thus discovered that CHIP regulates p53-mediated trans-repression of BACE1 at both transcriptional and post-translational level. We propose that a CHIP-BACE1-p53 feedback loop might control APP stabilization, which could further be utilized for new therapeutic intervention in AD.
25601891	Expression of bcl-2 and p53 in bovine cutaneous fibropapillomas.	Bocaneti F, Altamura G, Corteggio A, Velescu E, Borzacchiello G.	BACKGROUND: Bovine cutaneous fibropapillomas are benign hyperproliferative lesions induced by Bovine Papillomaviruses (BPVs). Bcl-2 is an important anti-apoptotic protein which is expressed in several cancer types. In contrary, p53 is a tumour suppressor protein that mediates cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and senescence in response to cellular stresses. FINDINGS: Here, we investigated immunohistochemically and biochemically, the expression of bcl-2 and p53 in a subset of BPV positive fibropapillomas and bovine normal skin. Normal skin samples showed a weak signal for both proteins in the cytoplasm of the basal cells. Nine out of twelve (75%) tumour samples stained positive for bcl-2 throughout basal and parabasal layers, with most of cells showing strong cytoplasmic immunoreactivity. Nine out of twelve (75%) fibropapillomas were found to be positive for p53 expression, showing a strong cytoplasmic and perinuclear staining of p53 protein mainly in the basal and parabasal layers. CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal an altered bcl-2 and p53 immunoreactivity in bovine cutaneous fibropapillomas, suggesting involvement of these two proteins in the cutaneous neoplastic transformation through an impaired apoptotic process.
26438057	Core domain mutant Y220C of p53 protein has a key role in copper homeostasis in case of free fatty acids overload.	Arciello M, Longo A, Viscomi C, Capo C, Angeloni A, Rossi L, Balsano C.	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a pathology that includes a wide variety of clinical conditions ranging from simple steatosis to end-stage liver diseases. Despite the huge amount of researches, the molecular basis of NAFLD are still not fully understood. Recently, it was suggested a role for p53 in NAFLD pathogenesis. Among its targets there is Synthesis of Cytochrome c Oxidase 2 (SCO2), a copper chaperone, involved in both aerobic respiration and metal cellular excretion. Copper seems to play a role in NAFLD. It was demonstrated a low hepatic copper content in NAFLD patients, which correlates with metabolic syndrome parameters. Copper homeostasis deregulation, in fact, seems to be related to lipid metabolism alteration and insulin resistance. Here we provide evidence on the role of p53 in the modulation of copper homeostasis, in an experimental model of NAFLD. We used two different hepatoma cell lines, HepG2 and Huh 7.5.1, characterized by the presence of wt p53 and its Y220C mutant, respectively, treated with a free fatty acids (FFAs) solution. Interestingly, p53 activation correlated with the intracellular copper level maintenance. We demonstrated that, in hepatoma cell lines, core domain mutant Y220C of p53 affects the modulation of SCO2 and Copper transporter 1 (CTR1), influencing, in this way, intracellular copper homeostasis in presence of FFAs accumulation, and that the 220 residue of the protein is crucial for such control. The role of p53 we highlighted may have deep implications in clinical conditions where copper homeostasis is deregulated.
25431853	The circadian clock controls sunburn apoptosis and erythema in mouse skin.	Gaddameedhi S, Selby CP, Kemp MG, Ye R, Sancar A.	Epidemiological studies of humans and experimental studies with mouse models suggest that sunburn resulting from exposure to excessive UV light and damage to DNA confers an increased risk for melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. Previous reports have shown that both nucleotide excision repair, which is the sole pathway in humans for removing UV photoproducts, and DNA replication are regulated by the circadian clock in mouse skin. Furthermore, the timing of UV exposure during the circadian cycle has been shown to affect skin carcinogenesis in mice. Because sunburn and skin cancer are causally related, we investigated UV-induced sunburn apoptosis and erythema in mouse skin as a function of circadian time. Interestingly, we observed that sunburn apoptosis, inflammatory cytokine induction, and erythema were maximal following an acute early-morning exposure to UV and minimal following an afternoon exposure. Early-morning exposure to UV also produced maximal activation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related (Atr)-mediated DNA damage checkpoint signaling, including activation of the tumor suppressor p53, which is known to control the process of sunburn apoptosis. These data provide early evidence that the circadian clock has an important role in the erythemal response in UV-irradiated skin. The early morning is when DNA repair is at a minimum, and thus the acute responses likely are associated with unrepaired DNA damage. The prior report that mice are more susceptible to skin cancer induction following chronic irradiation in the AM, when p53 levels are maximally induced, is discussed in terms of the mutational inactivation of p53 during chronic irradiation.
26327815	Toxoplasma gondii Rhoptry Protein ROP16 Mediates Partially SH-SY5Y Cells Apoptosis and Cell Cycle Arrest by Directing Ser15/37 Phosphorylation of p53.	Chang S, Shan X, Li X, Fan W, Zhang SQ, Zhang J, Jiang N, Ma D, Mao Z.	Toxoplasma rhoptries, an unusual set of apical organelles that are associated with Toxoplasma infection may cause subversion of the host cell functions. Parasite rhoptry protein 16 (ROP16) is a regulator of host cell transcription during cell invasion in which it migrates into the host cell cytoplasm and subsequently localizes to the nucleus. In the present study, we found that overexpression of ROP16 could partially mediate human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y apoptosis (12.47%) and cell cycle arrest in G1 phase (60.77%) in a p53 dependent manner by influencing the expression of Bax/Bcl-2 and p21/CDKs. ROP16 was identified to co-localize with p53, a novel direct interaction partner in the nucleus of SH-SY5Y. Furthermore, SH-SY5Y apoptosis via the mitochondria-dependent p53 pathway and cell cycle arrest caused by ROP16 dealt with direct serine 15/37 phosphorylation of p53. Our studies provide a new mechanism by which ROP16 interacts with the nucleus proteins which subsequently subverts the host cells functions.
26247726	NSC-87877 inhibits DUSP26 function in neuroblastoma resulting in p53-mediated apoptosis.	Shi Y, Ma IT, Patel RH, Shang X, Chen Z, Zhao Y, Cheng J, Fan Y, Rojas Y, Barbieri E, Chen Z, Yu Y, Jin J, Kim ES, Shohet JM, Vasudevan SA, Yang J.	Dual specificity protein phosphatase 26 (DUSP26) is overexpressed in high-risk neuroblastoma (NB) and contributes to chemoresistance by inhibiting p53 function. In vitro, DUSP26 has also been shown to effectively inhibit p38 MAP kinase. We hypothesize that inhibiting DUSP26 will result in decreased NB cell growth in a p53 and/or p38-mediated manner. NSC-87877 (8-hydroxy-7-[(6-sulfo-2-naphthyl)azo]-5-quinolinesulfonic acid), a novel DUSP26 small molecule inhibitor, shows effective growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in NB cell lines. NB cell lines treated with small hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting DUSP26 also exhibit a proliferation defect both in vitro and in vivo. Treatment of NB cell lines with NSC-87877 results in increased p53 phosphorylation (Ser37 and Ser46) and activation, increased activation of downstream p38 effector proteins (heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) and MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK2)) and poly ADP ribose polymerase/caspase-3 cleavage. The cytotoxicity resulting from DUSP26 inhibition is partially reversed by knocking down p53 expression with shRNA and also by inhibiting p38 activity with SB203580 (4-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-1H-imidazol-5-yl]pyridine). In an intrarenal mouse model of NB, NSC-87877 treatment results in decreased tumor growth and increased p53 and p38 activity. Together, these results suggest that DUSP26 inhibition with NSC-87877 is an effective strategy to induce NB cell cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo through activation of the p53 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) tumor-suppressor pathways.
25426556	Connexin32 regulates hepatoma cell metastasis and proliferation via the p53 and Akt pathways.	Zhao B, Zhao W, Wang Y, Xu Y, Xu J, Tang K, Zhang S, Yin Z, Wu Q, Wang X.	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progresses rapidly and is frequently associated with vascular invasion, metastasis, recurrence, and poor prognosis. The expression of connexin32 (Cx32) is frequently downregulated in HCC tissues. In this study, the role of Cx32 in HCC metastasis and proliferation was investigated. The reduction of Cx32 in HCC tissues was significantly associated with increased vascular invasion, increased tumor size, and poor survival. In vitro assays revealed that Cx32 not only suppressed the invasion and migration of HCC cells, but also repressed HCC cell proliferation. Subsequent investigations revealed that Cx32 directly enhanced the acetylation and transcriptional activity of p53, thus upregulating the expression of the tumor metastasis suppressor protein KAI1/CD82, which is a p53 target gene. Additionally, Cx32 negatively regulated the phosphorylation of Akt and the expression of the cell cycle regulation protein cyclin D1, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of HCC cells. Our in vivo nude mice model further confirmed that Cx32 is able to suppress HCC tumor growth and metastasis in nude mice. Our results imply that Cx32 downregulation contributes to the proliferation and metastasis of HCC, and the restoration of Cx32 expression may be a promising strategy for HCC therapy.
26343003	A Prognostic Gene Expression Signature in the Molecular Classification of Chemotherapy-naive Urothelial Cancer is Predictive of Clinical Outcomes from Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: A Phase 2 Trial of Dose-dense Methotrexate, Vinblastine, Doxorubicin, and Cisplatin with Bevacizumab in Urothelial Cancer.	McConkey DJ, Choi W, Shen Y, Lee IL, Porten S, Matin SF, Kamat AM, Corn P, Millikan RE, Dinney C, Czerniak B, Siefker-Radtke AO.	BACKGROUND: Gene expression profiling (GEP) suggests there are three subtypes of muscle-invasive urothelial cancer (UC): basal, which has the worst prognosis; p53-like; and luminal. We hypothesized that GEP of transurethral resection (TUR) and cystectomy specimens would predict subtypes that could benefit from chemotherapy. OBJECTIVE: To explore clinical outcomes for patients treated with dose-dense (DD) methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MVAC) and bevacizumab (B) and the impact of UC subtype. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Sixty patients enrolled in a neoadjuvant trial of four cycles of DDMVAC + B between 2007 and 2010. TUR and cystectomy specimens for GEP were available from 38 and 23 patients, respectively, and from an additional confirmation cohort of 49 patients treated with perioperative MVAC. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Relationships with outcomes were analyzed using multivariable Cox regression and log-rank tests. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Chemotherapy was active, with pT0N0 and ≤pT1N0 downstaging rates of 38% and 53%, respectively, and 5-yr overall survival (OS) of 63%. Bevacizumab had no appreciable impact on outcomes. Basal tumors had improved survival compared to luminal and p53-like tumors (5-yr OS 91%, 73%, and 36%, log-rank p=0.015), with similar findings on multivariate analysis. Bone metastases within 2 yr were exclusively associated with the p53-like subtype (p53-like 100%, luminal 0%, basal 0%; p ≤ 0.001). Tumors enriched with the p53-like subtype at cystectomy suggested chemoresistance for this subtype. A separate cohort treated with perioperative MVAC confirmed the UC subtype survival benefit (5-yr OS 77% for basal, 56% for luminal, and 56% for p53-like; p=0.021). Limitations include the small number of pretreatment specimens with sufficient tissue for GEP. CONCLUSION: GEP was predictive of clinical UC outcomes. The basal subtype was associated with better survival, and the p53-like subtype was associated with bone metastases and chemoresistant disease. PATIENT SUMMARY: We can no longer think of urothelial cancer as a single disease. Gene expression profiling identifies subtypes of urothelial cancer that differ in their natural history and sensitivity to chemotherapy.
25916635	Carbon monoxide protects against hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury by modulating the miR-34a/SIRT1 pathway.	Kim HJ, Joe Y, Yu JK, Chen Y, Jeong SO, Mani N, Cho GJ, Pae HO, Ryter SW, Chung HT.	Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury can arise as a complication of liver surgery and transplantation. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), an NAD+-dependent deacetylase, modulates inflammation and apoptosis in response to oxidative stress. SIRT1, which is regulated by p53 and microRNA-34a (miR-34a), can modulate non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, fibrosis and cirrhosis. Since carbon monoxide (CO) inhalation can protect against hepatic I/R, we hypothesized that CO could ameliorate hepatic I/R injury by regulating the miR-34a/SIRT1 pathway. Livers from mice pretreated with CO, or PFT, a p53 inhibitor, displayed reduced production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNF-α, iNOS, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1β after hepatic I/R injury. SIRT1 expression was increased by CO or PFT in the liver after I/R, whereas acetylated p65, p53 levels, and miR-34a expression were decreased. CO increased SIRT1 expression by inhibiting miR-34a. Both CO and PFT diminished pro-inflammatory cytokines production in vitro. Knockdown of SIRT1 in LPS-stimulated macrophages increased NF-κB acetylation, and increased pro-inflammatory cytokines. CO treatment reduced miR-34a expression and increased SIRT1 expression in oxidant-challenged hepatocytes; and rescued SIRT1 expression in p53-expressing or miR-34a transfected cells. In response to CO, enhanced SIRT1 expression mediated by miR-34a inhibition protects against liver damage through p65/p53 deacetylation, which may mediate inflammatory responses and hepatocellular apoptosis. The miR-34a/SIRT1 pathway may represent a therapeutic target for hepatic injury.
25922718	Ginsenoside metabolite compound K enhances the efficacy of cisplatin in lung cancer cells.	Li Y, Zhou T, Ma C, Song W, Zhang J, Yu Z.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential of ginsenoside metabolite compound K (CK) in enhancing the anti-tumor effects of cisplatin against lung cancer cells, including cell proliferation and apoptosis, and the underlying mechanism. METHODS: Western blotting and p53 reporter assay were used to assess p53 expression and activity. MTT assay and TUNEL staining were employed to investigate the drug effects on cell growth and apoptosis, respectively. Combination index (CI) was calculated to determine synergism. RESULTS: We found that CK could significantly enhance cisplatin-induced p53 expression and activity in two lung cancer cell lines, H460 and A549. Consequently, synergistic inhibition of cell growth was observed when the cells were co-treated with CK and cisplatin compared to single treatment. In addition, the ability of cisplatin in apoptosis induction was similarly synergized by CK. Furthermore, by using p53-null lung cancer cells, we demonstrate that the synergy was p53 dependent. CONCLUSIONS: Conventional chemotherapies are often accompanied by development of drug resistance and severe side effects. Novel discoveries of low toxicity compounds to improve the outcome or enhance the efficacy of chemotherapies are of great interest. In the present study, our data provide the first evidence that CK could be potentially used as an agent to synergize the efficacy of cisplatin in lung cancer.
25954860	Low expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog in clear‑cell renal cell carcinoma contributes to chemoresistance through activating the Akt/HDM2 signaling pathway.	Chen J, Zhu H, Zhang Y, Cui MH, Han LY, Jia ZH, Wang L, Teng H, Miao LN.	Clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) is the most frequent primary malignancy in the adult kidney. Most patients with advanced CCRCC have poor prognosis as CCRCC remains resistant to chemotherapy. The present study explored the possible mechanism underlying CCRCC resistance to chemotherapy and found that loss of PTEN in CCRCC may be involved. Knockdown of PTEN in the CCRCC cell line ACHN blocked etoposide-induced apoptosis and etoposide-impaired cell proliferation was also inhibited. It has been demonstrated that most chemotherapy drugs exert their anti-cancer effects via p53-mediated apoptosis, and in accordance, with this, the present study showed that treatment with etoposide significantly increased p53 levels. Silencing of PTEN in ACHN inhibited the Akt/HDM2 signaling cascade and depressed p53 expression, and the interaction between HDM2 and p53 was also enhanced. This was further verified in CCRCC tissue specimens from patients The results of the present study suggested that loss of PTEN, which deactivated Akt/HDM2 signaling followed by degradation of p53, may contribute to the development of etoposide resistance in CCRCC.
26037915	Two Faces of SIVA.	Resnick-Silverman L, Manfredi JJ.	In non-small cell lung cancer cells that contain a mutated KRAS gene, SIVA, a p53 target gene that is critical for apoptosis, is overexpressed in a p53-independent manner and promotes tumorigenesis through the stimulation of mTOR signaling. The ablation of Siva in conditional knockout mice results in an inhibition of tumor development that makes SIVA an interesting new candidate therapeutic target for the treatment of a carcinoma with few therapeutic options.
25510514	Affinities of organophosphate flame retardants to tumor suppressor gene p53: an integrated in vitro and in silico study.	Li F, Cao L, Li X, Li N, Wang Z, Wu H.	Health concerns have been raised in regards to the environmental impact of the more frequently used organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs). In this study, the effects of two typical OPFRs (TCPP and TPhP) on p53 gene expression in human embryo liver L02 cells were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. To better understand the relationship between molecular structural features of OPFRs and binding affinities for the tumor suppressor genes p53, an integrated experimental and in silico approach was used. The interaction of 9 OPFRs with p53 DNA fragment under simulated physiological conditions (phosphate buffer solution of pH 7.40), was explored by UV absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular modeling method. The binding constants of 9 OPFRs with p53 DNA fragment were determined respectively, using ethidium bromide (EB) as fluorescence probe of DNA. From docking analysis, hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions were found to be the dominant interactions. Based on the observed interactions, appropriate molecular structural parameters were adopted to develop a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model. The binding affinities of OPFRs to p53 DNA fragment were related with molecular electrostatic potential. The developed QSAR model had good robustness, predictive ability and mechanism interpretability.
25499978	Molecular mechanisms of hepatic apoptosis regulated by nuclear factors.	Wang K.	Apoptosis is a prominent characteristic in the pathogenesis of liver disease. The mechanism of hepatic apoptosis is not well understood. Hepatic apoptosis alters relative levels of nuclear factors such as Foxa2, NF-κB, C/EBPβ, and p53. Regulation of nuclear factors modulates the degree of hepatic apoptosis and the progression of liver disease. Nuclear factors have distinctive mechanisms to mediate hepatic apoptosis. The modification of nuclear factors is a novel therapeutic strategy for liver disease as demonstrated by pre-clinical models and clinical trials.
26405565	Combined therapies that induce senescence and stabilize p53 block melanoma growth and prompt antitumor immune responses.	Vilgelm A, Richmond A.	We recently demonstrated that dual therapy combining AURKA and MDM2 antagonists is effective against melanoma in preclinical settings. Notably, besides inducing apoptosis, this regimen led to tumor senescence and stimulated the host's antitumor immune defenses. Treatments leveraging both cancer cell-intrinsic and extrinsic antitumor mechanisms can improve melanoma therapeutic outcomes.
26141151	No association of p53 codon 72 polymorphism with idiopathic recurrent pregnancy loss in Korean population.	Yoon SH, Choi YM, Kim JJ, Hong MA, Lee SK, Yang KM, Paik EC.	OBJECTIVE: The balance of apoptosis and proliferation is an important part in the embryonic development during pregnancy. It has been reported that the p53 gene plays a significant role in angiogenesis and placental development, namely in reproduction and is suggested as a potential mediator of pregnancy. This study was performed to investigate whether the genetic polymorphism of the p53 gene is associated with idiopathic recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a case-control study in the Korean population. Study subjects consisted of 294 patients with idiopathic RPL and 300 postmenopausal controls. The genotyping for the p53 codon 72 polymorphism was performed using a Taqman assay. Continuous variables were compared using Student's t test and the χ(2) test was used to evaluate differences in the genotype distributions between the RPL and the controls. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the genotype distributions or allele frequencies of the p53 codon 72 polymorphism between the RPL and control group. There was also no significant association between the p53 codon 72 polymorphism and RPL risk in both recessive (Pro/Pro vs. Arg-carriers, p=0.314) and dominant model (Pro-carriers vs. Arg/Arg, p=0.383: data not shown). CONCLUSION: The codon 72 polymorphism in the p53 gene did not show any correlation with idiopathic RPL in Korean women, implying that it may not be susceptible allelic variants or be insufficient to cause RPL.

25483438	Hyperglycemia-induced GLP-1R downregulation causes RPE cell apoptosis.	Kim DI, Park MJ, Choi JH, Lim SK, Choi HJ, Park SH.	Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is closely associated with the onset of diabetes and its complications. However, its roles in diabetic retinopathy are unknown. Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are a crucial component of the outer blood-retina barrier and their death is related to the progression of diabetic retinopathy. Thus, we examined the pathophysiological role of GLP-1R in RPE cell apoptosis. We found that GLP-1R expression was lower in the isolated neuroretina and RPE cells of streptozotocin-treated rats than in vehicle-treated rats. High-glucose treatment also decreased GLP-1R expression in a human RPE cell line (ARPE-19 cells). GLP-1R was silenced in ARPE-19 cells, in order to elucidate the pathophysiological roles of GLP-1R. This increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and activated p53-mediated Bax promoter and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling. We also found that GLP-1R knockdown-mediated p53 expression was regulated by ER stress. Interestingly, antioxidant treatment and peroxiredoxin 1 (Prx1) overexpression attenuated GLP-1R knockdown-induced ER stress signaling and p53 expression. Finally, to confirm that GLP-1R activation has protective effects, ARPE-19 cells were treated with exendin-4, a synthetic GLP-1R agonist. This attenuated high-glucose-induced ROS generation, ER stress signaling, and p53 expression. Collectively, these results indicated that hyperglycemia decreases GLP-1R expression in RPE cells. Such a decrease generates intracellular ROS, which increases ER stress-mediated p53 expression, and subsequently causes apoptosis by increasing Bax promoter activity. Our data suggested that regulation of GLP-1R expression is a promising approach for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy.
25704606	Inhibition of wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 promotes liver regeneration in mice by direct activation of mammalian target of rapamycin.	Zhang L, Liu L, He Z, Li G, Liu J, Song Z, Jin H, Rudolph KL, Yang H, Mao Y, Zhang L, Zhang H, Xiao Z, Ju Z.	The liver possesses extraordinary regenerative capacity in response to injury. However, liver regeneration (LR) is often impaired in disease conditions. Wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (Wip1) is known as a tumor promoter and enhances cell proliferation, mainly by deactivating antioncogenes. However, in this work, we identified an unexpected role of Wip1 in LR. In contrast to its known role in promoting cell proliferation in extrahepatic tissue, we found that Wip1 suppressed hepatocyte proliferation after partial hepatectomy (PHx). Deletion of Wip1 increased the rate of LR after PHx. Enhanced LR in Wip1-deficient mice was a result of the activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway. Furthermore, we showed that Wip1 physically interacted with and dephosphorylated mTOR. Interestingly, inhibition of Wip1 also activated the p53 pathway during LR. Disruption of the p53 pathway further enhanced LR in Wip1-deficient mice. Therefore, inhibition of Wip1 has a dual role in LR, i.e., promoting hepatocyte proliferation through activation of the mTORC1 pathway, meanwhile suppressing LR through activation of the p53 pathway. However, the proregenerative role of mTORC1 overwhelms the antiproliferative role of p53. Furthermore, CCT007093, a Wip1 inhibitor, enhanced LR and increased the survival rate of mice after major hepatectomy.mTOR is a new direct target of Wip1. Wip1 inhibition can activate the mTORC1 pathway and enhance hepatocyte proliferation after hepatectomy. These findings have clinical applications in cases where LR is critical, including acute liver failure, cirrhosis, or small-for-size liver transplantations.
25602521	RB loss contributes to aggressive tumor phenotypes in MYC-driven triple negative breast cancer.	Knudsen ES, McClendon AK, Franco J, Ertel A, Fortina P, Witkiewicz AK.	Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by multiple genetic events occurring in concert to drive pathogenic features of the disease. Here we interrogated the coordinate impact of p53, RB, and MYC in a genetic model of TNBC, in parallel with the analysis of clinical specimens. Primary mouse mammary epithelial cells (mMEC) with defined genetic features were used to delineate the combined action of RB and/or p53 in the genesis of TNBC. In this context, the deletion of either RB or p53 alone and in combination increased the proliferation of mMEC; however, the cells did not have the capacity to invade in matrigel. Gene expression profiling revealed that loss of each tumor suppressor has effects related to proliferation, but RB loss in particular leads to alterations in gene expression associated with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. The overexpression of MYC in combination with p53 loss or combined RB/p53 loss drove rapid cell growth. While the effects of MYC overexpression had a dominant impact on gene expression, loss of RB further enhanced the deregulation of a gene expression signature associated with invasion. Specific RB loss lead to enhanced invasion in boyden chambers assays and gave rise to tumors with minimal epithelial characteristics relative to RB-proficient models. Therapeutic screening revealed that RB-deficient cells were particularly resistant to agents targeting PI3K and MEK pathway. Consistent with the aggressive behavior of the preclinical models of MYC overexpression and RB loss, human TNBC tumors that express high levels of MYC and are devoid of RB have a particularly poor outcome. Together these results underscore the potency of tumor suppressor pathways in specifying the biology of breast cancer. Further, they demonstrate that MYC overexpression in concert with RB can promote a particularly aggressive form of TNBC.
25445321	Mutations in and Expression of the Tumor Suppressor Gene p53 in Egg-Type Chickens Infected With Subgroup J Avian Leukosis Virus.	Yue Q, Yulong G, Liting Q, Shuai Y, Delong L, Yubao L, Lili J, Sidang L, Xiaomei W.	To investigate the molecular mechanisms of the oncogenic effects of avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J), we examined mutations in and the expression of p53 in the myelocytomas distributed in the liver, spleen, trachea, and bone marrow, as well as in fibrosarcomas in the abdominal cavity and hemangiomas in skin from chickens that were naturally or experimentally infected with ALV-J. Two types of mutations in the p53 gene were detected in myelocytomas of both the experimentally infected and the naturally infected chickens and included point mutations and deletions. Two of the point mutations have not been reported previously. Partial complementary DNA clones with a 122-bp deletion in the p53 gene ORF and a 15-bp deletion in the C-terminus were identified in the myelocytomas. In addition, moderate expression of the mutant p53 protein was detected in the myelocytomas that were distributed in the liver, trachea, spleen, and bone marrow. Mutant p53 protein was not detected in the subcutaneous hemangiomas or in the abdominal fibrosarcomas associated with natural and experimental ALV-J infection, respectively. These results identify mutations associated with abnormal expression of p53 in ALV-J-associated myelocytomas, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis.
