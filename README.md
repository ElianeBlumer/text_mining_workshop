### Abstract

*A practical workshop to introduce researchers to data and text mining.*

In many scientific domains, the primary form of knowledge dissemination is through published articles. One challenge for researchers is finding methods to make the knowledge from the tremendous backlog of publications accessible for search and analysis. In this workshop, we will review various text mining methods and walk through the various steps of data acquisition, data processing and data presentation. All steps are illustrated with practical examples in Python. In the last part of the workshop, each participant will have the opportunity to present a text-mining project that is relevant to her/his work. We will then briefly discuss together potential strategies and solutions.

### Agenda

#### 1) Introduction

#### 2) Basics

* a) [quick start with UNIX tools](2a_basics_unix_tools/unix_tools.ipynb)
* b*) regular expressions (https://regex101.com)
* c) know your text editor (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYuBVN-gUcE) and (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86LR8eYLn84)

#### 3) Data acquisition

* a) strategy, considerations, copyrights
* b*) [crawling data from an API (PubMed)](3b_pubmed_rest_api/pubmed_rest_api_client.ipynb)
* c*) [scraping data from a website](3c_pubmed_crawl_webpage/pubmed_crawl_webpage.ipynb)

#### 4) Data processing

* a*) text processing with NLTK
* b*) full-text search with Elasticsearch

#### 5) Data presentation

* a*) a simple website to present data & gather user feedback
* b) data presentation frameworks

#### 6) Your usecases

Each participant will take 5 min (alone or in small groups) to present a text-mining project that is relevant to her/his work. We will then briefly discuss together potential strategies and solutions.
